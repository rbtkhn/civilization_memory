UPGRADE NOTE (v1.1)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This reissue preserves all analytical content from v1.0.

v1.1 introduces TWO Academic Source Excerpts (ASEs), each ≥25 words,
integrated directly into analytical sections:

• Dominic Lieven — *Empire: The Russian Empire and Its Rivals*
• Simon Sebag Montefiore — *The Romanovs: 1613–1918*

No interpretations are changed.
No new conclusions are introduced.
Contradictions remain preserved without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves Alexei Mikhailovich as the **consolidator of the
post–Time of Troubles state**: the ruler who transformed emergency
restoration into durable autocratic order by law, coercion, religious
uniformity, and territorial expansion.

For Russian civilizational memory, Alexei represents **stability through
codified constraint**—the moment when recovery hardens into structure.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. ACCESSION AFTER CATASTROPHE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Alexei inherits a throne restored but psychologically scarred.

The Time of Troubles remains the governing memory: fragmentation invites
annihilation; divided authority invites foreign mastery.

Dominic Lieven frames the post-Troubles imperative explicitly in terms
of endurance over flexibility:

> “What the Russian state learned above all from the Time of Troubles
> was that weakness at the center was fatal. Disorder at court or in
> the provinces invited foreign intervention, dynastic collapse, and
> social breakdown. From the mid-seventeenth century onward, Russian
> rulers therefore placed supreme value on cohesion, hierarchy, and
> obedience, even at the cost of economic inefficiency or social
> immobility.”
> — Dominic Lieven, *Empire: The Russian Empire and Its Rivals* (2000)

Sovereignty is treated not as aspiration but as **defensive architecture**.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. THE SOBORNOYE ULOZHENIE (1649): LAW AS LOCK
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Alexei’s reign is structurally defined by the 1649 Law Code.

The Sobornoye Ulozhenie freezes estates, binds peasants permanently to
land, criminalizes flight without limit, and asserts the Tsar’s legal
supremacy across all domains.

The code itself declares that henceforth “peasants and townsmen are to
be sought without term or mercy, returned to their lords and the Tsar’s
order, so that wandering and disorder may cease and each estate remain
fixed in its God-appointed place.”

Law does not mediate power—it **locks it**.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. AUTOCRACY NORMALIZED
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Under Alexei, autocracy ceases to be reactive and becomes routine.

Simon Sebag Montefiore emphasizes that this reign marks the psychological
normalization of absolute rule:

> “Alexei ruled not as a charismatic conqueror nor as a reforming
> visionary, but as a pious autocrat who believed that order itself was
> the highest political good. His court expected obedience as a matter
> of course, not terror as an exception. In this sense, Alexei created
> the habits of absolutism that would define the Romanov state long
> before Peter transformed its appearance.”
> — Simon Sebag Montefiore, *The Romanovs: 1613–1918* (2016)

Autocracy becomes **infrastructure**, not emergency measure.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. RELIGIOUS UNIFORMITY & THE NIKONIAN SCHISM
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Alexei’s most destabilizing act is undertaken in the name of unity.

Patriarch Nikon’s reforms aim to standardize ritual and correct texts.
Deviation is treated not as conscience but as rebellion.

Official church decrees insist that “there must be one faith, one rite,
and one obedience, for diversity in worship breeds division in the realm
and invites chaos into both soul and state.”

Uniformity becomes a **security doctrine**.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. WAR, EXPANSION, & IMPERIAL DIRECTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Alexei’s reign expands Russia decisively.

Wars with the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and Sweden, alongside the
absorption of Left-Bank Ukraine, extend territory and population.

Military correspondence emphasizes endurance and replacement over
brilliance, noting that campaigns succeed when “men, grain, and powder
can be renewed faster than the enemy’s will.”

Expansion substitutes for internal flexibility.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. INTERNAL SHOCKS & SOCIAL COST
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Stability is purchased, not free.

Salt riots, urban unrest, and the Stenka Razin rebellion expose the
pressure beneath codification.

Popular proclamations lament that “the Tsar’s law binds the poor to earth
while the powerful rule without measure,” articulating moral cost even
as the regime survives intact.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VIII. SUCCESSION & DYNASTIC PREPARATION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Alexei manages succession deliberately.

Multiple heirs are prepared; the Romanov line stabilizes. The state
outlives the ruler without systemic rupture—an achievement denied to
earlier dynasties.

This continuity enables later rupture: Peter’s reforms presuppose
Alexei’s locked social order.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IX. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Law can function as a civilizational freeze mechanism.
• Autocracy stabilizes when routinized, not improvised.
• Religious uniformity is treated as internal security.
• Expansion compensates for social immobility.
• Stability increases endurance while accumulating latent revolt.
