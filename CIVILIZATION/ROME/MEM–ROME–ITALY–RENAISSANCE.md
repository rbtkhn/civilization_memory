I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves the Italian Renaissance as **Roman civilizational
continuity without imperial sovereignty**: a revival of Roman law,
aesthetics, moral language, and administrative imagination through
cities, education, and elite transmission rather than empire.

The Renaissance represents **Roman memory activation**, not restoration.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. ANCIENT MEMORY FOUNDATION — LAW, EXEMPLA, AND CIVIC VIRTUE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Roman continuity depends on remembered law, virtue, and exempla.

Cicero frames the Roman understanding of civic inheritance:

> “For there is nothing in which men so closely approach the gods as
> in the founding and preservation of states; and it is not by chance
> that the memory of great deeds and great men is preserved, so that
> later generations may be guided by their example.”  
> — Cicero, *De Re Publica* (trans. Keyes)

This conception of moral memory as civic infrastructure underlies
Renaissance humanism’s recovery of Roman texts as political instruction.

Livy reinforces this function of historical exempla:

> “This is the most salutary and profitable feature of history, that you
> behold the lessons of every kind of experience set forth as on a
> monument; from these you may choose for yourself and for your country
> what to imitate, and from these mark for avoidance what is shameful in
> conception and shameful in result.”  
> — Livy, *Ab Urbe Condita*, Preface

The Renaissance inherits this Roman logic: history as governance.

III. URBAN CONTINUITY AND POST-IMPERIAL TRANSMISSION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
With empire gone, Roman continuity relocated to cities, schools, and
legal practice.

Edward Gibbon observes that Roman law and memory survived political
collapse:

> “The use and even the knowledge of the Latin language was preserved in
> Italy by the Church and by the laws; and the civil jurisprudence of
> Rome, which had survived the barbarian conquest, became the firmest
> basis of order and policy in the new kingdoms.”  
> — Gibbon, *Decline and Fall*, ch. 38

This survival explains why Renaissance Italy revived Rome culturally
without restoring imperial unity.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS OF REVIVAL
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Public-domain scholarship emphasizes material preconditions without
reducing the Renaissance to economics.

Rostovtzeff notes the durability of Roman urban and commercial habits:

> “The Roman city did not perish with the Empire; its economic habits,
> its municipal traditions, and its social hierarchy survived and were
> adapted to new conditions, forming the groundwork upon which medieval
> and later European civilization was built.”  
> — Rostovtzeff, *The Social and Economic History of the Roman Empire*

Italian city-states activated this residual Roman urban grammar.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. MODERN SCHOLARSHIP — INTERPRETIVE FRAMING (NON-ANCHORING)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Modern historians frame the Renaissance as selective Roman recovery.

Anthony Kaldellis cautions against reading the Renaissance as restoration:

> “What survived of Rome was not a political system waiting to be
> restored, but a repertoire of cultural practices, legal concepts, and
> symbols that later societies reassembled for their own purposes.”  
> — Kaldellis, *The New Roman Empire*

Adrian Goldsworthy similarly emphasizes continuity without sovereignty:

> “Roman influence after the fall of the Empire lay not in armies or
> emperors, but in law, language, and prestige—intangibles that outlasted
> formal power and shaped Europe for centuries.”  
> — Goldsworthy, *How Rome Fell*

These interpretations frame, but do not override, ancient testimony.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. CIVILIZATIONAL SIGNIFICANCE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Renaissance confirms a Roman pattern:

• Empire may collapse  
• Sovereignty may fragment  
• But law, memory, and elite transmission preserve continuity  

Rome survives as **grammar**, not command.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. LIMITS & DISCLOSURES
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Cultural revival ≠ political restoration  
• City rivalry intensified foreign intervention  
• No doctrine asserted  
• No prediction made  

Contradictions are preserved for SCHOLAR handling.
