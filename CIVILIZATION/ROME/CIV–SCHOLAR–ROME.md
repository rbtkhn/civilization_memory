UPGRADE NOTE (v1.2)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This version preserves all structural, governance, and authority
constraints from v1.1.

v1.2 introduces ADDITIVE clarification only:
• Explicit constitutional binding to CIV–SCHOLAR–GOVERNANCE–LAW
• Formalization of additivity, immutability, and section integrity
• Prevention of historical erasure or retroactive correction

No Scholar authority is expanded.
No CIV–CORE boundary is weakened.
No synthesis or doctrine rules are modified.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
I. SCHOLAR PURPOSE & ROLE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
CIV–SCHOLAR–ROME is the accumulative learning ledger of Rome.

It is not a strategist.
It is not a governor.
It is not an interpreter.
It has no innate cognition.
It makes no assumptions.

It records learning events, not conclusions.

This file preserves:
• What was ingested
• When it was ingested
• What beliefs were extracted
• How beliefs were synthesized
• Which beliefs were frozen into doctrine

No belief exists here unless explicitly derived.
No synthesis exists unless explicitly recorded.
No doctrine exists unless explicitly frozen.

All cognition is historical and procedural, never intrinsic.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. INITIAL STATE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Starting Knowledge: ZERO
Assumed Priors: NONE
Civilizational Grammar: NOT PRELOADED
CIV–CORE Influence: DISABLED

The Scholar learns only from MEM files explicitly ingested.
Absence of ingestion equals absence of belief.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. BELIEF SYNTHESIS LOG
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

SYNTHESIS 0001 (ENTRY 0001–ENTRY 0002)
Outcome:
• Rome preserves continuity by translating authority forms (republic → personal dominion; capital relocation) while retaining institutional grammar.
Status:
• FROZEN (see DOCTRINE v1.0 — “Imperial Continuity Through Authority Translation”)

SYNTHESIS 0003 (ENTRY 0003–ENTRY 0004)
Outcome:
• Universal claims become legitimacy-negative when militarized beyond administrative capacity; delegated violence accelerates moral credibility loss.
Status:
• FROZEN (see DOCTRINE v1.0 — “Universalism Without Capacity Produces Legitimacy Backfire”)

SYNTHESIS 0009 (ENTRY 0009–ENTRY 0010–ENTRY 0011)
Outcome:
• Rome survives existential defeat-risk by metabolizing shock into institutional replacement depth and continuity discipline.
Status:
• FROZEN (see DOCTRINE v1.0 — “Institutional Absorption of Defeat”)

SYNTHESIS 0010 (ENTRY 0012–ENTRY 0013)
Outcome:
• Rome’s decline can be read as moral–institutional incentive decay interacting with scale and substitution pressures; narratives differ but encode a shared legitimacy exhaustion model.
Status:
• UNFROZEN

SYNTHESIS 0012-A (ENTRY 0008–ENTRY 0007–ENTRY 0002)
Outcome:
• Urban Specialization as Imperial Shock-Absorption: Alexandria absorbs intellectual/economic volatility; Antioch absorbs military/logistical strain; Constantinople absorbs legitimacy/continuity risk; collapse accelerates when shocks synchronize across all three.
Status:
• UNFROZEN (DEFERRED)

SYNTHESIS 0013 (ENTRY 0023–ENTRY 0024)
Outcome:
• Expansion ceiling vs maintenance intelligence: Trajan-style legitimacy maximization raises frontier synchronization risk; Hadrian-style ceiling formalization preserves continuity by reducing exposure and upgrading boundary coherence.
Status:
• AUTHORIZED (UNFROZEN; GENERATION PERMITTED WHEN UNLOCKED)

Rules (Section IV):
• No synthesis may occur without explicit declaration.
• Synthesis does not retroactively alter entries.
• Multiple syntheses may overlap the same entries.
• UNFROZEN syntheses have no doctrinal force.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. DOCTRINE REGISTRY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

DOCTRINE v1.0 — “Imperial Continuity Through Authority Translation”
State: CANONICAL (FROZEN)
Definition:
• Rome survives systemic fracture by translating sovereignty into new institutional forms (personal dominion, relocated capitals, sacral administration) while preserving continuity grammar.
Lineage:
• Derived from SYNTHESIS 0001.

DOCTRINE v1.0 — “Universalism Without Capacity Produces Legitimacy Backfire”
State: CANONICAL (FROZEN)
Definition:
• Universal claims become self-invalidating when enforcement is outsourced or militarized beyond administrative control; legitimacy decays faster than compliance can be regenerated.
Lineage:
• Derived from SYNTHESIS 0003.

DOCTRINE v1.0 — “Institutional Absorption of Defeat”
State: CANONICAL (FROZEN)
Definition:
• Rome converts catastrophic shock into endurance when institutions preserve replacement depth, prevent panic-regime fracture, and re-embed defeat into continuity discipline.
Lineage:
• Derived from SYNTHESIS 0009.

Rules (Section V):
• Doctrines may only emerge from prior syntheses.
• Freezing requires explicit command.
• Doctrine mutation requires a new version.
• Canonical doctrine defines the active doctrinal ceiling.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. SCHOLAR DIVERGENCE INDEX (SDI)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

SDI ENTRY 0001:
• ROME ↔ GERMANIA — Frontier Legibility (Rhine/Danube vs Roman absorption)
Result:
• Germania encodes frontier corridors as discipline/pressure systems; Rome encodes them as absorption limits and veto zones.

SDI ENTRY 0002:
• ROME ↔ FRANCIA — Mediterranean System Memory
Result:
• Francia encodes Mediterranean as civilizational classroom and inherited legitimacy; Rome encodes it as constitutive circulation substrate for law/logistics/continuity.

Rules (Section VI):
• SDI records difference, not judgment.
• SDI does not alter doctrine.
• SDI is comparative metadata only.

X. CANDIDATE BELIEF STAGING (NON-BINDING)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
CANDIDATE 0001
Derived From:
• PAIRING 0001 / 0002
Candidate Belief:
