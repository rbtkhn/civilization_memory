I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves Sulla as **the first Roman to prove that armed force
could permanently override republican legality**: the figure who
demonstrated, before Caesar, that sovereignty could be seized, reshaped,
and enforced by marching an army on Rome itself.

Sulla represents **precedent as poison**.
He restores republican forms while destroying their authority.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. STRUCTURAL CONTEXT: REPUBLIC UNDER STRAIN
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Sulla emerges from a Republic already destabilized by expansion.

Background pressures:
• Overseas empire outgrowing civic institutions
• Professionalized legions loyal to commanders
• Senatorial paralysis
• Rising populares vs optimates polarization

Rome still believes procedure can survive crisis.
Sulla proves otherwise.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. THE FIRST MARCH ON ROME
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
In 88 BC, Sulla commits an unprecedented act.

He leads Roman legions against the city itself.

As Appian records, Sulla justifies the act as necessity:

> “He said that the laws were silent in times of war, and that it was
> necessary for him to save the state by force when persuasion had failed,
> since the city was already enslaved to faction and violence.”

This establishes a new political fact:
armed legitimacy supersedes legal legitimacy.

Rome crosses a line it cannot uncross.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. DICTATORSHIP WITHOUT TIME LIMIT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Sulla appoints himself dictator legibus faciendis et rei publicae constituendae.

This title matters:
• No emergency expiration
• No external oversight
• Authority to rewrite law itself

As Plutarch observes:

> “He made himself master of the state, not by law, but by arms, and having
> obtained power, he used it to settle his own authority rather than the
> freedom of the Romans.”

Dictatorship ceases to be a tool.
It becomes a regime.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. PROSCRIPTIONS AS SYSTEMIC TERROR
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Sulla institutionalizes violence through proscriptions.

Features:
• Public lists of enemies
• Legalized murder and confiscation
• Incentivized betrayal
• Political cleansing masquerading as justice

Plutarch describes the effect:

> “The city was filled with slaughter, and many were put to death without
> trial, not for what they had done, but for who they were.”

Fear becomes governance.

The Republic survives formally,
but obedience now rests on terror.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. CONSTITUTIONAL “RESTORATION”
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Sulla claims to restore senatorial authority.

Actions:
• Weakens tribunes
• Strengthens Senate
• Codifies cursus honorum
• Limits popular legislation

Yet this restoration is hollow.

Law exists only because Sulla enforces it.
Procedure is no longer sovereign.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. VOLUNTARY RETIREMENT & FATAL LESSON
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Sulla resigns and retires voluntarily.

This act confuses contemporaries.
It does not redeem the damage.

The lesson absorbed by Rome:
• Power can be taken by force
• Law follows violence
• Retirement is optional, not required

Later figures—Pompey, Caesar—learn this lesson well.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VIII. RELATED MEM CONNECTIONS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Sulla establishes the model later accelerated in MEM–ROME–CAESAR:
  armed entry into Rome as political instrument.

• His terror-state anticipates the legitimacy collapse analyzed in
  MEM–ROME–CICERO, where rhetoric fails against force.

• The normalization of violence sets conditions later exploited in
  MEM–ROME–SPARTACUS, where systemic brutality breeds revolt.

• Comparative cases: MEM–GERMANIA–WAR–TEUTOBURG–FOREST (limits of force),
  MEM–FRANCIA–NAPOLEON (precedent and overreach), MEM–RUSSIA–STALIN
  (terror as administrative shortcut).

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IX. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Precedent destroys institutions faster than ideology.
• Terror can stabilize procedure but annihilates legitimacy.
• Restoration enforced by violence is not restoration.
• Retirement does not undo the example.
• Sulla makes Caesar inevitable.

Tension preserved without verdict.
