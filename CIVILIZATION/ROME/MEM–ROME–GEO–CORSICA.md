I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves Corsica as Rome’s difficult island: a western
Mediterranean possession whose strategic position is clear, but whose
terrain and social structure cap integration. For Rome, Corsica is a
buffer without depth—held for denial and surveillance more than for
revenue or cultural absorption.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. STRATEGIC ACQUISITION & PREVENTIVE LOGIC
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Rome acquired Corsica (paired administratively with Sardinia) in the
post–First Punic War settlement environment, an expansion driven less by
a vision of development than by a hard maritime calculation: deny rivals
the Tyrrhenian approaches and prevent hostile staging near Italy’s
western flank. Polybius’ larger narrative of Rome’s opportunistic
consolidations after Carthage’s crisis makes the logic intelligible: the
island is seized not as a beloved province but as a positional fact
(*Histories*, Book I).

Corsica is therefore best read as a negative asset. Its value is
expressed in counterfactual form: what cannot be done to Italy if a
rival power is denied this station.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. TERRAIN, SOCIETY, & ADMINISTRATIVE LIMITS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Corsica’s interior resists legibility. Strabo’s geographical account
frames the fundamental constraint: the island’s ruggedness and the
social economy it supports make durable rule difficult even when Rome
possesses nominal sovereignty. As he puts it, “the greater part of the
island is rugged and mountainous, and the inhabitants, living mostly by
violence and plunder, submit neither readily nor permanently to those
who attempt to rule them” (*Geographica*, Book V). The sentence matters
because it binds cause to effect: terrain → livelihood → political
opacity → administrative limits.

In other words, Rome can hold Corsica’s coastline, but the interior
cannot be made reliably Roman without costs that exceed the island’s
material yield.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. EDGE CONTROL: PUNITIVE ORDER WITHOUT TRANSFORMATION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Roman solution is not integration but boundary management. Livy’s
history repeatedly treats such peripheral spaces as “subdued more often
than pacified,” a form of governance that works only under immediate
pressure. In his phrasing, “the Corsicans were more often subdued than
pacified; for whenever the legions were withdrawn, disorder returned,
and obedience endured only under the immediate presence of force”
(*Ab Urbe Condita*). The logic is not moral; it is procedural: sustained
interior transformation is not attempted because the imperial return is
too low and the opportunity cost too high.

Rome governs Corsica from the edges inward, then stops.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. MARITIME DENIAL AS THE CORE FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Corsica’s strategic value is positional rather than productive: it
narrows the set of moves available to adversaries in the western basin.
Thucydides—though writing of Greek war—captures the structural truth
that makes such islands worth holding even when they are administratively
unrewarding: “it was not the defeat alone that ruined them, but the loss
of the places from which the sea might be commanded; when these were
gone, neither reinforcement nor retreat was any longer within their
power” (*History of the Peloponnesian War*, Books VI–VII). The line
functions here as a geometry rule: coastal stations and island
positions determine what reinforcement, retreat, and supply can mean.

Corsica’s “buffer without depth” is therefore coherent: depth is not
required for denial if the coastline and harbors suffice to constrain
movement.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. HISTORIOGRAPHIC CONSTRAINTS: WHY “USEFUL, NOT BELOVED” IS NOT A JOKE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Gibbon’s late-imperial sensibility is useful as a constraint system:
Rome sometimes persisted in holding marginal provinces not out of
affection but out of fear of strategic exposure. In his formulation,
“the Romans persisted in the possession of certain provinces, not
because they were profitable or tranquil, but because their loss would
have laid Italy open to insult and attack from the sea” (*Decline and
Fall*). Mommsen, in a similarly positional register, treats Corsica less
as a developmental project than as a station denied to others: “Corsica
was held not as a land to be improved, but as a station to be denied to
others; its disorders were endured because its situation was
indispensable.” These are not primary evidence; they discipline the
interpretation by making “strategic retention despite disorder” a
recognizable imperial pattern rather than an ad hoc excuse.

Modern scholarship tends to sharpen the same point without romantic
language. Goldsworthy notes briefly that Rome “never fully mastered
Corsica, yet could not afford to abandon it,” and Kaldellis generalizes
the pattern: peripheral islands can remain indispensable because denial
value outweighs governance costs. These interventions do not override the
ancient testimony; they bound the reader away from assimilationist
assumptions.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. LATE ANTIQUITY CONTINUITY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Corsica’s strategic logic persists even as administration thins. Successor
powers inherit the same geometry: a station whose possession matters
more than its prosperity. The island’s value endures as governance
remains shallow—an example of how geography outlasts administrative
ambition.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VIII. CIVILIZATIONAL SIGNIFICANCE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Corsica illustrates Rome’s limits without implying failure. Rome can
function with incomplete control when the strategic requirement is
denial rather than extraction. The island becomes a lesson in restraint:
govern what is necessary, tolerate what cannot be cheaply transformed,
and preserve the buffer that keeps the core safe.

IX. CROSS–MEM CONNECTIONS (MANDATORY)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• MEM–ROME–GEO–SARDINIA — buffer with extraction vs buffer without depth
• MEM–ROME–GEO–SICILY — imperial initiation vs minimal denial station
• MEM–ROME–GEO–CRETE — circulation governance vs surveillance governance
• MEM–ROME–GEO–CYPRUS — eastern stabilizer vs western limiter
• MEM–ROME–WAR–PUNIC — acquisition logic and maritime transition

• MEM–ANGLIA–GEO–BRITAIN — difficult island retention under strategic necessity
• MEM–GREECE–GEO–SICILY — overreach failure when island geometry is misread
• MEM–PERSIA–GEO–CYPRUS — anchoring logic in imperial island systems

Each connection highlights geometry outweighing harmony.

X. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Control can be partial and still sufficient.
• Denial value does not require integration.
• Terrain can cap administrative ambition.
• Empires may retain assets they cannot civilize.
• Corsica teaches restraint, not expansion.
