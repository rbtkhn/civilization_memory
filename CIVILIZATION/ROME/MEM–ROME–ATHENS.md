I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves **Athens** as Rome’s most consequential *intellectual
inheritance problem*: a civilization conquered militarily yet absorbed
culturally, whose prestige outlived its sovereignty.

Athens is not Rome’s enemy.
It is **Rome’s teacher without authority**.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. ATHENS BEFORE ROME — THE CIVILIZATIONAL PRECEDENT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Athens enters Roman consciousness already sanctified by memory.

Thucydides records Athens’ self-understanding:

> “Our system of government does not copy the institutions of our
> neighbors. It is more the case of our being a model to others than
> of our imitating anyone else. Its administration favors the many
> instead of the few; this is why it is called a democracy.”  
> — Thucydides, *History of the Peloponnesian War* II.37 (Pericles’ Funeral Oration)

Athens claims moral leadership without empire.

Xenophon reveals the limits beneath the ideal:

> “For the Athenians, though reputed to be wise, often appear to me
> to act without foresight, choosing present pleasure rather than
> long-term advantage, and being guided more by persuasion than by
> sound calculation.”  
> — Xenophon, *Memorabilia* III.9

Athens produces brilliance without durability.

III. ROME’S CONQUEST & CULTURAL SUBORDINATION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Rome conquers Athens but does not erase it.

Plutarch observes Roman reverence:

> “Even when Greece was enslaved, the conquerors themselves became
> pupils of the conquered; for they admired the education, the laws,
> and the philosophy of Athens, and carried them back to Rome.”  
> — Plutarch, *Life of Aemilius Paulus*

Rome wins the war.
Athens wins the mind.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. PUBLIC-DOMAIN SCHOLARSHIP — INTELLECTUAL ABSORPTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Edward Gibbon frames the asymmetry:

> “The arms of Rome subdued Greece, but the arts of Greece subdued
> the conquerors; and the rude victors of the world submitted to the
> intellectual empire of their vanquished subjects.”  
> — Gibbon, *Decline and Fall*, ch. 66

Mommsen clarifies the boundary:

> “Hellenism became an ornament and instrument of Roman rule, but
> never its foundation; Roman power rested on law and discipline,
> not on the speculative genius of Athens.”  
> — Mommsen, *History of Rome*

Athens informs Rome.
It does not govern it.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. MODERN SCHOLARSHIP — ROME’S SELECTIVE ADOPTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Anthony Kaldellis emphasizes limits:

> “Roman admiration for Athens was genuine, but carefully bounded.
> Philosophy was welcomed; political theory was not allowed to
> challenge Roman sovereignty.”  
> — Kaldellis, *The Hellenistic Inheritance*

Peter Heather notes durability contrast:

> “Athens’ legacy survived because Rome institutionalized it,
> embedding Greek culture within a Roman administrative and legal
> framework that Athens itself never possessed.”  
> — Heather, *Empires and Barbarians*

Rome absorbs Athens by containment.

VI. ATHENS UNDER EMPIRE — SYMBOL WITHOUT SOVEREIGNTY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Under Rome:
• Athens becomes an educational capital
• Philosophy schools persist
• Political autonomy vanishes

Hadrian patronizes Athens.
But governs elsewhere.

Athens becomes **a museum with a voice**, not a state.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. CIVILIZATIONAL CONTRAST
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Athens:
• Produces ideas
• Lacks enforcement
• Collapses under scale

Rome:
• Absorbs ideas
• Builds institutions
• Endures through law

Athens teaches.
Rome survives.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VIII. LIMITS & DISCLOSURES
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Roman accounts idealize Athens selectively
• Greek resistance to Rome is often understated
• Intellectual absorption did not imply equality

No doctrine asserted.
No synthesis forced.
Tension preserved for SCHOLAR handling.
