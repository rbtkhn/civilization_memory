I. PURPOSE & AUTHORITY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file is the **exclusive registry of accepted Anglian
civilizational doctrines**.

It contains:
• Doctrines explicitly accepted via DIB–ANGLIA
• Definitions suitable for CIV–CORE citation
• No learning history
• No beliefs
• No rejected or provisional material

This file:
• Does NOT learn
• Does NOT synthesize
• Does NOT evolve autonomously

Authority Flow:
CIV–MEM–CORE → CIV–CORE–ANGLIA → DIB–ANGLIA → CIV–DOCTRINE–ANGLIA

Only doctrines listed here may be treated as **authoritative**.

II. DOCTRINE REGISTRY (AUTHORITATIVE)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

DOCTRINE 01
Name: PROCEDURE AS CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY
Status: ACCEPTED · LOCKED · CANONICAL
Source: CIV–SCHOLAR–ANGLIA → DIB–ANGLIA (Approved)

Definition:
Anglia preserves civilizational continuity not primarily through
territory, dynasty, or ideology, but through **procedure**: repeatable,
precedent-based processes that encode authority, legitimacy, and dispute
resolution across time. Procedure functions as memory, allowing Anglia
to survive regime loss, territorial contraction, and moral contradiction
without civilizational reset.

Operational Meaning:
• Authority resides in process, not persons
• Continuity survives defeat if procedure remains intact
• Law, precedent, and institutional habit substitute for ideology

Hard Constraints:
• Procedure fails if enforcement collapses entirely
• Procedure degrades if legitimacy outpaces perceived fairness
• Procedure cannot compensate for total elite eradication (see Doctrine 02)

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

DOCTRINE 02
Name: RUPTURE ABSORPTION THROUGH ELITE REPLACEMENT
Status: ACCEPTED · LOCKED · CANONICAL
Source: CIV–SCHOLAR–ANGLIA → DIB–ANGLIA (Approved)

Definition:
Anglia can survive even catastrophic defeat when rupture results in
**elite replacement rather than institutional annihilation**. Invasion
or loss becomes survivable if new elites adopt, hybridize with, or are
absorbed into Anglia’s procedural grammar, rather than destroying it.

Operational Meaning:
• Defeat is survivable if institutions are repurposed, not erased
• Elite continuity is less important than institutional continuity
• Hybridization can strengthen long-term durability

Hard Constraints:
• Rupture becomes terminal if procedures are fully dismantled
• Replacement fails if new elites rule purely through coercion
• Total cultural erasure invalidates absorption

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

DOCTRINE 03
Name: DEFEAT WITHOUT LEGITIMACY COLLAPSE
Status: ACCEPTED · LOCKED · CANONICAL
Source: CIV–SCHOLAR–ANGLIA → DIB–ANGLIA (Approved)

Definition:
Anglia can lose wars, territory, and imperial status without internal
legitimacy collapse, provided defeat is **procedurally managed**. Loss
does not delegitimize authority if adjudicated through recognized
institutions, negotiated settlement, and lawful transition.

Operational Meaning:
• Parliamentary debate substitutes for regime crisis
• Exit preserves legitimacy better than denial
• Retrenchment is a strategic option, not failure

Hard Constraints:
• Defeat becomes destabilizing if framed as illegitimate
• Procedural exit requires elite compliance
• Repeated defeats without adaptation erode confidence

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

DOCTRINE 04
Name: TIME AS A STRATEGIC WEAPON
Status: ACCEPTED · LOCKED · CANONICAL
Source: CIV–SCHOLAR–ANGLIA → DIB–ANGLIA (Approved)

Definition:
Anglia converts time into power. Through finance, institutional patience,
and coalition endurance, Anglia defeats adversaries who depend on
decisive victory, personal authority, or ideological momentum.

Operational Meaning:
• Delay favors systems with fiscal and legal continuity
• Attrition is preferable to decisive confrontation
• Victory is achieved by outlasting, not overpowering

Hard Constraints:
• Time advantage collapses if fiscal solvency fails
• Delay fails if coalitions fracture
• Time cannot compensate for naval or procedural loss

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

DOCTRINE 05
Name: COALITION PRIMACY OVER SINGULAR VICTORY
Status: ACCEPTED · LOCKED · CANONICAL
Source: CIV–SCHOLAR–ANGLIA → DIB–ANGLIA (Approved)

Definition:
Anglia maximizes power by **subordinating authorship to coalition
durability**. Shared victory, delegated mass warfare, and distributed
burden outperform unilateral brilliance.

Operational Meaning:
• Allies absorb cost Anglia need not bear directly
• Victory legitimacy is externalized
• Balance matters more than dominance

Hard Constraints:
• Coalitions fail without financial and naval underpinning
• Delegation fails if command integration collapses
• Coalition war is ineffective against systems immune to legitimacy loss

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

DOCTRINE 06
Name: NAVAL DENIAL AS EXISTENTIAL DEFENSE
Status: ACCEPTED · LOCKED · CANONICAL
Source: CIV–SCHOLAR–ANGLIA → DIB–ANGLIA (Approved)

Definition:
Anglia’s survival depends on **denial of hostile movement**, not
territorial conquest. Naval supremacy functions as an existential
shield, preventing invasion and externalizing continental conflict.

Operational Meaning:
• Sea control substitutes for land mass
• Invasion prevention outweighs battlefield victory
• Maritime dominance converts geography into security

Hard Constraints:
• Naval failure exposes the core immediately
• Denial fails if logistics collapse
• Sea control must be continuous, not episodic

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

DOCTRINE 07
Name: MYTH AS STABILIZER, NOT ENGINE
Status: ACCEPTED · LOCKED · CANONICAL
Source: CIV–SCHOLAR–ANGLIA → DIB–ANGLIA (Approved)

Definition:
Anglia uses myth, symbolism, and moral narrative to **stabilize**
institutions, not to generate power. Myth amplifies endurance but cannot
replace procedure, capacity, or legitimacy.

Operational Meaning:
• Narrative reinforces compliance
• Symbolism sustains morale during loss
• Myth follows system success; it does not create it

Hard Constraints:
• Myth collapses if contradicted by procedure
• Symbolism cannot override institutional failure
• Moral narrative without enforcement accelerates decay

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. EXPLICITLY REJECTED DOCTRINES (NON-AUTHORITATIVE)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The following are **explicitly excluded** from this registry:

• PERMANENT MORAL SUPERIORITY — REJECTED  
  Reason: Violates procedural neutrality; destabilizes legitimacy under loss

• INEVITABLE PROGRESS — REJECTED  
  Reason: Incompatible with Anglia’s defeat-absorption model

Rejected doctrines:
• Have zero authority
• May not be cited operationally
• Are retained only in SCHOLAR audit trails

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
