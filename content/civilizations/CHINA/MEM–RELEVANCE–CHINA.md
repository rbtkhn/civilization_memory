MEM–RELEVANCE–CHINA — v1.0
Civilizational Memory Codex · MEM Relevance Index

Status: ACTIVE
Version: 1.0
Entity: China / People's Republic of China (PRC)
Purpose: Maps STATE-relevant analytical dimensions to MEM files
Last Updated: February 2026

This index enables the Decision Points activity and other STATE
analyses to quickly identify which MEM files contain relevant historical
parallels, patterns, and precedents for the current decision space.

Organised by the analytical dimensions that recur in CIV–STATE–CHINA
(and that map to CIV–CORE–CHINA diagnostics and CIV–DOCTRINE–CHINA 01–03).
Each dimension lists MEMs ranked by relevance (primary = central to the
dimension; secondary = relevant context).

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
HOW TO USE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. Identify the analytical dimension of the current Decision Point
   (e.g. "mandate stability" or "maritime/spatial integrity")
2. Consult the relevant section below
3. Load primary MEMs first; secondary MEMs for depth
4. Cross-reference: a Decision Point may span multiple dimensions
5. Read MEM file contents; do not cite by name only (grounded parallels)
6. After loading primary MEMs, read their MEM CONNECTIONS and load
   up to 2 additional MEMs from connection edges when relevant

XIV. MAINTENANCE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This index is manually maintained. Update when:
• A new MEM–CHINA file is added (sync with CIV–INDEX–CHINA)
• A new STATE dimension emerges from Decision Points or other STATE sessions
• An analytical gap is discovered (e.g. missing dimension or under-linked MEM)
• CIV–CORE–CHINA or CIV–DOCTRINE–CHINA adds diagnostics or doctrines
  that imply new dimensions

When the full concept-based retrieval system is activated
(PROPOSAL–TIERED–RETRIEVAL), this index may be superseded by
automated concept queries. Until then, MEM SCAN uses this file
as the primary dimension-based lookup for STATE–CHINA.
