I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves Guangzhou (Canton, 广州) as the **first
treaty-port node** of Chinese civilizational memory: the
space that was the sole permitted port for Western trade
under the Qing Canton system, and then **one of five**
treaty ports opened by the Treaty of Nanjing (1842). Lin
Zexu's seizure and destruction of British opium at Canton
(1839) triggered the First Opium War; Canton was thus the
**structural opener** of the "century of humiliation" at
the level of place—before Shanghai rose to dominance,
Guangzhou was the primary maritime interface with the West.

Guangzhou is remembered not only as a city, but as the
**Canton node**: humiliation (opened by force, treaty port)
and connectivity (maritime trade, Lingnan gateway) in one.
Under the PRC, Guangzhou has remained a major southern
megacity and commercial hub—reincorporated, no concession.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

II. GEOGRAPHIC & STRUCTURAL MEMORY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Guangzhou sits on the Pearl River (珠江), with access to
the South China Sea and to the Lingnan hinterland. It
was the **Canton** of the Canton system: the single port
through which Western trade was channeled before the
Opium Wars. After the Treaty of Nanjing (1842), it
became one of five treaty ports (with Shanghai, Xiamen,
Fuzhou, Ningbo)—the only one that had already been
the designated trade port. Its role shifted from
**monopoly** (Canton system) to **one among five** (treaty
ports); Shanghai would later eclipse it in volume, but
Guangzhou remained the **southern gateway**.

Key structural features:
• Canton system: sole Qing port for Western trade before 1842
• Treaty port (from 1842): opened by Nanjing; one of five
• Lin Zexu and First Opium War: Canton as trigger site (1839)
• PRC megacity: Lingnan hub; no concession; reincorporated 1949

III. HUMILIATION & CONNECTIVITY AT CANTON
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Guangzhou encodes **humiliation** in the treaty-port sense:
the Canton system was ended by force; the city was opened
by the Treaty of Nanjing; foreign presence and legal
imposition followed. It also encodes **connectivity**:
maritime trade, Lingnan commerce, and the southern
gateway to China. The First Opium War began at Canton
(Lin Zexu, 1839); the war ended with Nanjing and five
ports opened—Canton first among them. For Republican
and PRC narrative, Guangzhou is evidence of the
**opening of the humiliation arc** at the level of
place: Canton was where the Qing lost control of the
maritime interface.

IV. PRC REINCORPORATION & LINGNAN HUB
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The PRC reincorporated Guangzhou (1949); concessions and
extraterritoriality ended. The city has remained the
economic and transport center of the Pearl River delta—
alongside and in tension with Shenzhen, the SEZ created
in 1980. Guangzhou thus also encodes **reconstitution**:
the southern gateway under party–state control; no
foreign concession. The contrast with the Canton system
and treaty-port era is structural: then, foreign trade
imposed or channeled; now, PRC sovereignty with commercial
openness. Shenzhen (neighboring SEZ) has grown faster in
reform era; Guangzhou retains historical and administrative
primacy in Lingnan.

• MEM–CHINA–WAR–FIRST–OPIUM — Dependency: Canton as trigger site (Lin Zexu 1839); one of five treaty ports (1842). Breaks if removed: no opener framing.
• MEM–CHINA–WAR–SECOND–OPIUM — Dependency: Treaty port framework extended; Canton in concession era. Breaks if removed: no sequel framing.
• MEM–CHINA–DYNASTY–QING — Dependency: Qing Canton system; treaty port under Qing. Breaks if removed: no dynasty framing.
• MEM–CHINA–SHANGHAI — Dependency: Contrast—Canton first treaty port vs Shanghai dominant; both opened 1842. Breaks if removed: loss of node contrast.
• MEM–CHINA–SHENZHEN — Dependency: Contrast—Guangzhou historic Lingnan hub vs Shenzhen SEZ (1980); Pearl River delta pair. Breaks if removed: loss of reform-era contrast.
• MEM–CHINA–PRC — Dependency: PRC reincorporation; Lingnan hub. Breaks if removed: no contemporary framing.
• MEM–CHINA–CHENGDU — Dependency: Contrast—Guangzhou treaty port vs Chengdu interior; never opened. Breaks if removed: loss of interior/coast contrast.
