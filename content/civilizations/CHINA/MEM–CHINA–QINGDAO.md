I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves Qingdao (青岛) as the **leasehold node** of
Chinese civilizational memory: the space that was **leased** to
Germany as Kiautschou (胶州) in 1898—following the murder of two
German missionaries in Shandong—and then occupied by Japan
(1914–1922) before return to Chinese sovereignty. Qingdao encodes
**humiliation as leasehold**: not cession in perpetuity (like Hong
Kong 1842), but **territory removed** from Qing control by unequal
treaty for a term; the same era that saw the Boxer Rebellion and
the Protocol saw Qingdao pass to Germany and then Japan. Under the
PRC, Qingdao is a major Shandong port and city—reincorporated,
no concession; the memory of Kiautschou remains.

Qingdao is remembered not only as a city, but as the **contrast
to cession**: leased, not ceded; returned (1922), not held until
1997 like Hong Kong. Contrast with Hong Kong (British cession),
Tianjin (treaty port, concessions), and Jinan (Shandong capital,
never a concession).

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

II. GEOGRAPHIC & STRUCTURAL MEMORY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Qingdao sits on the southern coast of the Shandong Peninsula,
on the Yellow Sea. It was a minor Qing-era settlement before
1898; the **Kiautschou lease (1898)** gave Germany a 99-year
lease (in practice ended 1914) and made Qingdao a German
naval base and port. After Japan seized it (1914), the
**Washington Conference (1922)** returned Qingdao to China.
Key structural features: **leasehold**—not cession; **German
then Japanese**—colonial imposition in the scramble-for-concessions
era; **return**—unlike Hong Kong, territory was returned by
treaty (1922) before PRC; **Shandong**—same province as Jinan
(provincial capital); Qingdao coastal, Jinan interior.

Key structural features:
• Kiautschou (1898–1914): German lease; naval base; port development; missionary trigger
• Japanese occupation (1914–1922): seized from Germany in WWI; returned to China at Washington Conference
• Not a treaty port (1842): opened by lease, not by Nanjing or Tianjin treaties; second-wave imperial imposition
• PRC: Shandong port city; reincorporated 1949; no concession

III. LEASEHOLD & SCRAMBLE-FOR-CONCESSIONS ERA
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Qingdao encodes **humiliation as leasehold**: the Kiautschou
lease (1898) was imposed after the murder of two German
missionaries in Shandong—Germany demanded and received a
leasehold, not merely a treaty port. The **structural contrast**
with Hong Kong (cession 1842) is that Qingdao was **leased**,
not ceded; with Tianjin (treaty port 1860, concessions) is
that Qingdao was a **single-power leasehold** (German, then
Japanese), not a multi-concession treaty port. The era (1898)
places Qingdao in the **scramble for concessions**—same period
as Boxer buildup, extended treaty-port system, and foreign
railroad and mining rights. For Republican and PRC narrative,
Qingdao is evidence that humiliation was not only coastal
treaty ports but **territorial lease**—land removed from
Qing control for a term.

IV. RETURN 1922 & PRC REINCORPORATION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The **return of Qingdao (1922)** at the Washington Conference
encoded **recovery by diplomacy**: China recovered the leasehold
without war; Japan withdrew. The contrast with Hong Kong (returned
1997, after 155 years) is structural: Qingdao was **returned
earlier** and **had been leased**, not ceded. Under the PRC,
Qingdao was reincorporated (1949); no foreign presence. The
city remains a major port and industrial node—beer (Tsintaou
legacy), shipping, Shandong gateway—without concession. The
contrast with Shenzhen (PRC-designed SEZ, never lost) and
Jinan (Shandong capital, never a concession) is structural:
Qingdao is leasehold-then-returned, then PRC hub.

• MEM–CHINA–DYNASTY–QING — Dependency: Qing ceded lease 1898; humiliation era. Breaks if removed: no dynasty framing.
• MEM–CHINA–WAR–BOXER–REBELLION — Dependency: Same era; Shandong missionary trigger; scramble for concessions. Breaks if removed: no era framing.
• MEM–CHINA–HONG–KONG — Dependency: Contrast—Hong Kong ceded (1842); Qingdao leased (1898); Hong Kong returned 1997, Qingdao 1922. Breaks if removed: loss of cession vs lease contrast.
• MEM–CHINA–TIANJIN — Dependency: Contrast—Tianjin treaty port (1860), concessions; Qingdao leasehold (1898). Same humiliation geography, different form. Breaks if removed: loss of node contrast.
• MEM–CHINA–JINAN — Dependency: Shandong pair; Jinan provincial capital (interior), Qingdao port (coastal); Jinan never concession. Breaks if removed: no regional framing.
• MEM–CHINA–PRC — Dependency: PRC reincorporation; Shandong. Breaks if removed: no contemporary framing.
• MEM–CHINA–WAR–SECOND–OPIUM — Dependency: Contrast—Tianjin/Beijing opened 1860; Qingdao 1898 (later wave). Breaks if removed: loss of treaty-wave contrast.
