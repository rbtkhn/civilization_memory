I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves the **Mongol queens and regency period** as a
**succession bridge** within Chinese and Eurasian memory: the phase
between Genghis Khan’s death (1227) and Kublai’s consolidation, in
which **women exercised formal and informal authority** over the
largest contiguous empire in world history.

The Mongol queens are remembered not as anomalies, but as **structural
participants** in succession—regents who held the polity together
when male succession was contested, and who shaped the transition from
shock (Genghis) to translation (Kublai).

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. POSITION IN MONGOL CONTINUITY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Genghis Khan did not establish a fixed succession rule; his death left
**open** the question of who would hold the empire. Ögödei was elevated
at a kurultai (1229), but the **regency** between khans—and the role
of senior women (wives, mothers) in convening kurultais, managing
treasury, and choosing successors—became a structural feature.

The period c. 1227–1251 includes:
• **Töregene** (Ögödei’s widow) — Regent after Ögödei’s death (1241);
  convened kurultai that elected Güyük (1246).
• **Oghul Qaimish** (Güyük’s widow) — Regent after Güyük’s death (1248);
  contested authority until Möngke’s election (1251).

Structurally, **regency** filled the gap when no adult male heir was
uncontested; women controlled treasury, patronage, and the timing of
kurultais—and thus the conditions under which the next khan was chosen.

III. SOURCE EVIDENCE — WEATHERFORD (ARC–CHINA)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Jack Weatherford, *Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World* (Crown, 2004) (ARC–CHINA–T–MODERN):

"For the next ten years, until 1251, she and a small group of other women controlled the largest empire in world history."

Discovery: expanded search for regency and women in governance.

IV. STRUCTURAL LOGIC: SUCCESSION & INCENTIVES
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
From a structural view, regency was **rational**: when the khan died,
someone had to hold the polity together until a kurultai could be
convened and a successor legitimized. Senior women had **information**
(treasury, lineage, loyalties) and **incentive** (protect their
children’s and their own position). They did not command armies in
the field as Genghis had; they commanded **access**—to resources,
to legitimacy rituals, and to the timing of succession.

The incentive structure favored **temporary centralization** in the
hands of regents—enough to prevent fragmentation before the next
khan—but not permanent female rule. Once Möngke was elected (1251),
the regency phase closed; the structural logic was **bridge**, not
replacement.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. LEGITIMACY & CIVILIZATIONAL ENCODING
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
It seems to me that the Mongol queens present a **legitimacy puzzle**:
they exercised authority without claiming the title of khan—they
**performed** regency (treasury, kurultai, patronage) while male
succession remained the formal source of legitimacy. The encoding
is **bridge**: they held the polity together so that a new khan
could be chosen—they did not replace the grammar of male conquest
legitimacy, they **suspended** it temporarily.

The civilizational encoding is that **succession required mediation**;
women provided that mediation when contested male heirs could not.
Tension preserved: authority without formal title; structural necessity
(Mearsheimer) and legitimacy-as-performance (Mercouris) are complementary.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. LINK TO GENGHIS AND KUBLAI
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
MEM–CHINA–MONGOL–GENGHIS–KHAN encodes Genghis as **exposure**—no
sedentary governance, no Chinese legitimacy; “successors attempt
synthesis.” The regency period is **where** that attempt began:
Ögödei and his successors initiated bureaucratic and fiscal experiments,
and **regents** held the space in which those experiments could
continue between khans.

MEM–CHINA–MONGOL–KUBLAI–KHAN encodes Kublai as **civilizational
translator**—stacked legitimacy, Dadu, maritime turn. The regency
period is the **bridge** between Genghis’s non-claim and Kublai’s
translation: without regents holding the polity, the succession to
Möngke (and then the contest that led to Kublai) would not have
occurred in the same form.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Regency filled the succession gap when no adult male heir was uncontested.
• Women controlled treasury, patronage, and timing of kurultais—structural participation.
• “She and a small group of other women controlled the largest empire” — authority without title.
• Bridge between Genghis (shock) and Kublai (translation); successors attempt synthesis.
• Legitimacy performed as regency; male conquest legitimacy suspended, not replaced.

Tension preserved without verdict.
