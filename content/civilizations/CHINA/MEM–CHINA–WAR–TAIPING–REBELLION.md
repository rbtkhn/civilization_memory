I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves the **Taiping Rebellion** as the **structural
civil war** of the late Qing: a millenarian uprising that established
a rival state (Heavenly Kingdom of Great Peace, 太平天国), seized
the Yangtze heartland and Nanjing (1853–1864), and devastated central
China—weakening the Qing at the very moment of renewed foreign pressure
(Second Opium War, Treaty of Aigun, Convention of Beijing). The war
is remembered not only as internal rupture but as **structural
condition**: Qing forces and resources were tied down; the dynasty
could not resist Russian territorial claims or Anglo-French coercion
with full strength. The Taiping encoded **legitimacy contest**—Hong
Xiuquan's claim to divine kingship vs Qing imperial mandate—and
**corridor logic**: control of the Yangtze and Nanjing decided who
held the heartland.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

II. STRUCTURAL LOGIC: CIVIL WAR & WEAKENED QING
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Structurally, the Taiping War was the **convergence** of Qing
legitimacy stress, millenarian mobilization, and Yangtze geography.
Hong Xiuquan (洪秀全)—failed examination candidate, influenced by
Christian tracts—proclaimed himself younger brother of Jesus and
founded the Heavenly Kingdom (1851). Taiping forces moved north and
east, took Nanjing (1853), and made it the rebel capital for eleven
years. The **balance of force** shifted over time: Qing raised
regional armies (Hunan Army under Zeng Guofan, 曾国藩); Taiping
internal strife and Qing siege warfare eventually broke the rebellion.
Nanjing fell in 1864; Hong died; the Heavenly Kingdom collapsed. The
**structural outcome**: tens of millions dead; central China devastated;
Qing survived but was **weakened**—unable to concentrate against
foreign threats (Second Opium War 1856–1860, Russian pressure on the
Amur 1858–1860). The Taiping did not cause the humiliation treaties;
they **conditioned** them—Qing could not fight on two fronts.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. CAMPAIGN & THEATER: YANGTZE CORRIDOR
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Taiping War was fought along the **Yangtze corridor**—the same
geography that had decided Song–Yuan (Xiangyang) and would encode
humiliation (Nanjing 1842, 1937). Taiping forces moved from Guangxi
north and east; they took Wuhan, then Nanjing (1853). Nanjing became
**Taiping capital** (天京)—the rebel court and administrative centre.
Qing forces besieged Nanjing and contested the corridor; the Hunan
Army (湘军) and other regional armies gradually reclaimed territory.
Key structural facts:
• **Nanjing as node**—who held Nanjing held the lower Yangtze; Taiping
  held it 1853–1864; Qing siege and internal Taiping collapse led to fall.
• **Yangtze as corridor**—bulk movement, supply, and political control
  followed the river; the war was a contest for the corridor.
• **Devastation**—siege warfare, famine, and disease produced massive
  mortality; central China was depopulated and ruined.
• **Qing survival**—regional armies (Zeng Guofan, Li Hongzhang) proved
  more effective than Banner forces; legitimacy was preserved by
  Han-led military power under Qing nominal authority.

IV. LEGITIMACY CONTEST: MANDATE VS MILLENARIAN KINGSHIP
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Taiping encoded a **legitimacy contest**: Hong Xiuquan claimed
divine kingship (Son of Heaven in a Christian-millenarian frame);
the Qing claimed the traditional mandate (天命). The rebellion was
not only a military conflict but a **symbolic war**—who had the
right to rule? Taiping ideology combined folk Christianity, equality
rhetoric (land reform, gender norms), and anti-Manchu sentiment; the
Qing framed the rebellion as heresy and treason. The outcome—Qing
victory, Taiping destruction—preserved the imperial frame but at
enormous cost. Later Republican and PRC narratives would sometimes
claim the Taiping as **proto-revolutionary** (peasant uprising,
anti-Manchu); the Qing and conservative tradition encoded them as
rebel and heterodox. The MEM does not resolve the encoding; it
preserves the tension: legitimacy contested, corridor held then lost,
dynasty weakened.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. STRUCTURAL CONSEQUENCE: WEAKENED QING & HUMILIATION ERA
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Taiping War **weakened** the Qing at the moment of renewed
foreign pressure. The Second Opium War (1856–1860) overlapped with
the Taiping; Qing could not concentrate against Anglo-French forces
or resist Russian territorial demands (Treaty of Aigun 1858,
Convention of Beijing 1860) with full strength. The Amur cession and
the Summer Palace were negotiated and imposed while the dynasty was
still fighting the Taiping. So the Taiping is **structural condition**
for the humiliation era: not the cause of the treaties, but the
condition that made Qing resistance weaker. MEM–CHINA–WAR–SECOND–OPIUM
and MEM–CHINA–GEO–AMUR–RIVER depend on this context—Qing distracted,
resources tied down, northern and southern humiliation simultaneous.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Civil war can weaken a dynasty at the moment of external threat—Qing survived the Taiping but could not resist Aigun and Beijing.
• The Yangtze corridor encodes both conquest (Song–Yuan), humiliation (Nanjing 1842), and civil war (Taiping capital 1853–1864).
• Legitimacy contest (mandate vs millenarian kingship) was decided by force—Qing won, but at cost that conditioned later collapse.
• Regional armies (Hunan Army) preserved Qing nominal authority but shifted military power to Han elites—precedent for late Qing and Republican fragmentation.
• Taiping in later memory: proto-revolutionary (PRC) vs rebel/heterodox (Qing, conservative)—encoding contested.

Tension preserved without verdict.

VII.B. SOURCE EVIDENCE — KEEGAN (CIVILIZATION-CONTRAST)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

John Keegan, *A History of Warfare* (Alfred A. Knopf, 1993) (ARC–CHINA–T–MODERN):

"[Clausewitz] had little to say about oriental war."

John Keegan, *The Mask of Command* (Jonathan Cape, 1987) — applied insight (belief collapse):

"When the Guard retreated, the army knew the battle was lost. The retreat became a rout not because of further combat but because belief had collapsed."

— Keegan on collision of war-making cultures and belief collapse: the Taiping was a **legitimacy and symbolic war**—mandate vs millenarian kingship—not a European rational-politics clash. Clausewitz "little of oriental war" applies: the contest was who had the right to rule, decided by siege and corridor control. **Belief collapse**: when Nanjing fell (1864), the Taiping polity lost its linchpin; the Heavenly Kingdom "knew" the rebel capital was gone and resistance fragmented. The long siege of Nanjing encodes **mask of command** (Hong Xiuquan in the city, Zeng Guofan outside) and **face of battle** (siege, famine, devastation). Encoding divergence: MEM encodes civil war and weakened Qing; Keegan supplies military-historian lens (belief collapse, war-making culture, siege as decisive node).
