I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves the Grand Canal as a **corridor of bulk movement**
within Chinese civilizational memory: a space where **control of
waterborne logistics**, not land speed alone, determined capacity
to sustain sieges, supply capitals, and project force—and where
Mongol/Yuan extension and use of the Canal became the **structural
condition** for conquest of the Southern Song and post-conquest
connectivity.

The Canal is remembered not as a static waterway, but as **flow
infrastructure**: whoever could move grain and materiel along the
Yellow–Yangtze axis could sustain northern capitals and southern
campaigns; the Yuan built and used that capacity to defeat the Song.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

II. GEOGRAPHIC & STRUCTURAL MEMORY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Grand Canal links the Yellow River (Huang He) to the Yangtze
(Chang Jiang), with historical extensions to the Huai and to
Beijing (Dadu). It is not a single channel but a **network of
segments** that have been rebuilt, rerouted, and extended across
dynasties.

Key structural features:
• Bulk transport of grain (漕运) from south to north for capital supply  
• Chokepoint logic: control of key nodes (locks, junctions) = control of flow  
• Complement to overland speed: land for speed, water for bulk  
• Yuan extension and lengthening under Kublai for military supply and conquest  

Terrain enforces **logistics logic**: control the canal, control the surplus.

> "Despite the initial reliance of commerce on routes created through military conquest, it soon became obvious that whereas armies moved quickest by horse across land, massive quantities of goods moved best by water. Mongols expanded and lengthened the Grand Canal that already connected the Yellow and Yangtze Rivers to transport grain and other agricultural products farther and more efficiently into the northern districts."

GEOGRAPHIC PARAMETERS:
| Field         | Value |
|---------------|-------|
| REGION_BOUNDS | Yellow River–Yangtze corridor; extensions to Huai, to Dadu/Beijing (Yuan) |
| TERRAIN_TYPE  | Riverine, canal, locks, junctions |
| KEY_FEATURES  | Grain transport (漕运); military supply; Yuan extension for Song campaign |

STRATEGIC SIGNIFICANCE:
| Field                | Value |
|----------------------|-------|
| CHOKEPOINT           | Yes: locks and junctions; control = bulk flow control |
| PROJECTION_CORRIDOR  | Yes: supply for northern capitals and southern campaigns |
| RESOURCE_SIGNIFICANCE| Grain, materiel; revenue and supply for state and military |

CONTROL SEQUENCE:
| Era     | Controller | Use           | Notes                    |
|---------|------------|---------------|--------------------------|
| Sui–Tang| Chinese    | Capital supply| Early Grand Canal        |
| Song    | Song       | Southern Song | Canal as asset           |
| Yuan    | Mongol/Yuan| Military + grain | Kublai extended for Song campaign; conquest-as-connectivity |
| Ming–Qing | Chinese  | Capital supply| Beijing grain route      |

IV. YUAN CONQUEST & CONQUEST-AS-CONNECTIVITY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Structurally, Kublai's extension and use of the Grand Canal was
the **condition** for sustained siege and projection against the
Southern Song. Land for speed; water for bulk. The Yuan built
both—cavalry and overland mobility plus canal-based logistics
for Xiangyang and downriver operations. Conquest created the
incentive to secure and extend the corridor; the corridor then
outlasted the conquest as post-Yuan connectivity (Pax Mongolica,
grain supply, trade).

CIV–SCHOLAR–CHINA DOCTRINE v0.3 (Conquest-as-Connectivity): conquest
created the structural condition for connectivity; secure corridors
and adaptive governance outlasted conquest. The Grand Canal is
the **named corridor** for this doctrine in the Song–Yuan context.

Jack Weatherford, *Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World* (Crown, 2004) (ARC–CHINA–T–MODERN):

"Despite the initial reliance of commerce on routes created through military conquest, it soon became obvious that whereas armies moved quickest by horse across land, massive quantities of goods moved best by water. Mongols expanded and lengthened the Grand Canal that already connected the Yellow and Yangtze Rivers to transport grain and other agricultural products farther and more efficiently into the northern districts."

"Khubilai Khan promoted the building of ever larger seagoing junks to carry heavy loads of cargo and ports to handle them."
