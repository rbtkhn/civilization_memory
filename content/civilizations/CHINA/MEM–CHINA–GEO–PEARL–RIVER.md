I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves the Pearl River (珠江) and its **delta** as
the **geographic frame** for Lingnan humiliation and reconstitution:
the space where the Canton system channeled Western trade, where
the Treaty of Nanjing (1842) opened Guangzhou and **ceded Hong
Kong**, where the reform-era SEZ (Shenzhen) was placed adjacent
to British Hong Kong, and where the handover (1997) reincorporated
Hong Kong as an SAR. The delta is not a single MEM but the
**corridor** that contains: treaty port (Guangzhou), ceded
territory (Hong Kong), PRC-designed SEZ (Shenzhen), and
post-handover SAR (Hong Kong). One geography—multiple
sovereignty and humiliation layers.

The Pearl River is remembered as **delta logic**: control of
the river mouth and its nodes (Canton, Hong Kong, Macau,
Shenzhen) has determined who could trade, who could
impose, and who could reclaim. Contradictions are
preserved without synthesis.

II. GEOGRAPHIC & STRUCTURAL MEMORY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Pearl River (珠江) drains much of Guangdong and forms a
**delta** at the South China Sea—multiple distributaries,
estuarine complexity, and a corridor that links the
hinterland (Lingnan) to maritime trade. Key nodes:
**Guangzhou** (Canton)—upstream, the historic port of
the Canton system and one of five treaty ports (1842);
**Hong Kong**—at the mouth, ceded 1842, British colony
to 1997, now SAR; **Macau**—Portuguese-administered
(from Ming/Qing period), returned 1999; **Shenzhen**—adjacent
to Hong Kong, PRC SEZ from 1980, never ceded.

Key structural features:
• Canton system: Pearl River delta as sole permitted Qing–Western trade interface
• Treaty and cession: Guangzhou opened 1842; Hong Kong ceded 1842; delta as humiliation geography
• Reform-era: Shenzhen SEZ (1980) on PRC side of border with Hong Kong; delta as reconstitution geography
• Handover: Hong Kong SAR (1997); delta again under single sovereignty (PRC), with SAR and SAR-like (Macau) status

Terrain enforces **delta logic**: whoever controls the mouth and key nodes controls access to Lingnan.

III. DELTA AS HUMILIATION CORRIDOR
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Pearl River delta encodes **humiliation** in layers:
(1) **Canton system**—trade channeled through one port
on Qing terms; (2) **Treaty of Nanjing (1842)**—Canton
opened as one of five treaty ports, and **Hong Kong
Island ceded**; (3) **Convention of Beijing (1860)**—
Kowloon ceded; (4) **Convention 1898**—New Territories
leased. The delta thus became the **spatial unit** where
both treaty-port imposition (Guangzhou) and **territorial
cession** (Hong Kong) occurred—unlike the Yangtze delta
(Shanghai treaty port, but no cession of territory at
Shanghai). For civilizational memory, the Pearl River
delta is the **cession corridor**: the place where
sovereign territory was transferred by treaty.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. DELTA AS RECONSTITUTION CORRIDOR
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The same delta encodes **reconstitution**: (1) **Shenzhen**
(1980)—PRC created an SEZ adjacent to British Hong Kong,
encoding "opening by choice" on the same coastline;
(2) **Handover (1997)**—Hong Kong returned to PRC
sovereignty as SAR; (3) **Macau (1999)**—returned to
PRC. The delta that had been partitioned (British
Hong Kong, Portuguese Macau, PRC Guangdong with
Guangzhou reincorporated 1949) was again under
one sovereign—with SAR and special status preserved
by PRC design. MEM–CHINA–GUANGZHOU, MEM–CHINA–HONG–KONG,
MEM–CHINA–SHENZHEN are the **node MEMs**; this file
is the **geographic frame** that contains them.

V. MEM CONNECTIONS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• MEM–CHINA–GUANGZHOU — Dependency: Canton/Guangzhou as delta treaty-port node. Breaks if removed: no Canton framing.
• MEM–CHINA–HONG–KONG — Dependency: Hong Kong as delta cession node; handover 1997. Breaks if removed: no cession framing.
• MEM–CHINA–SHENZHEN — Dependency: Shenzhen as delta SEZ node; PRC-designed opening. Breaks if removed: no reform-era framing.
• MEM–CHINA–WAR–FIRST–OPIUM — Dependency: Treaty of Nanjing 1842; Canton opened, Hong Kong ceded. Breaks if removed: no delta humiliation framing.
• MEM–CHINA–NANJING — Dependency: Treaty of Nanjing signed at Nanjing; delta ports and cession by that treaty. Breaks if removed: no treaty framing.
• MEM–CHINA–PRC — Dependency: PRC reincorporation of Guangzhou; SEZ Shenzhen; handover Hong Kong/Macau. Breaks if removed: no reconstitution framing.
• MEM–CHINA–DYNASTY–QING — Dependency: Canton system; Qing cession of Hong Kong. Breaks if removed: no dynasty framing.
• MEM–CHINA–SHANGHAI — Dependency: Contrast—Yangtze delta (Shanghai treaty port, no cession) vs Pearl River delta (Guangzhou + Hong Kong ceded). Breaks if removed: loss of delta contrast.
