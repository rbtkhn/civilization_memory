I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves Hangzhou (杭州), historically **Lin'an (临安)**,
as the **Southern Song capital and Grand Canal southern terminus**
of Chinese civilizational memory: the space where the Song court
retreated after the loss of the north (1127), making it the
southern capital until the Mongol conquest (1276)—and where the
Grand Canal delivered grain and linked the Yangtze to the
political center. Hangzhou encodes **interior southern capital**:
not a treaty port in the first wave (1842); opened later
(1895, Treaty of Shimonoseki) as part of the extended treaty-port
system. West Lake (西湖) and the canal terminus fixed it as
cultural and logistical node—contrast with Shanghai (dominant
treaty port from 1842) and Guangzhou (Canton, first among five).

Hangzhou is remembered not only as a city, but as the **contrast
to coastal-first humiliation**: Southern Song capital on imperial
terms; treaty port only in the second wave (1895). Under the PRC,
Hangzhou is the provincial capital of Zhejiang and a major
Yangtze delta hub—reincorporated, no concession.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

II. GEOGRAPHIC & STRUCTURAL MEMORY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Hangzhou sits at the southern end of the Grand Canal and on
the Qiantang River (钱塘江), with access to the Yangtze delta
and the East China Sea. It was **Lin'an** under the Southern
Song—the capital to which the court retreated when Kaifeng
fell (1127). The Grand Canal linked it to the north; West
Lake became the symbolic and cultural center. It was **not**
one of the five treaty ports (1842); it was opened to
foreign trade in **1895** (Treaty of Shimonoseki)—encoding
a later, secondary wave of treaty-port imposition.

Key structural features:
• Southern Song capital (1127–1276): Lin'an; Grand Canal southern terminus; West Lake
• Treaty port (from 1895): opened by Treaty of Shimonoseki; not one of the first five
• Grand Canal node: southern terminus; grain and cultural corridor
• PRC: Zhejiang provincial capital; Yangtze delta hub; reincorporated 1949

III. LIN'AN & SOUTHERN SONG CAPITAL
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Hangzhou (Lin'an) encodes **southern capital refuge**: when
the north was lost to the Jin (1127), the Song court
retreated south and made Lin'an the capital. The Grand
Canal supplied it; West Lake and the southern elite
defined it as cultural center. The Mongol conquest
(1276) ended Southern Song; the Yuan then extended
the Canal north to Dadu (Beijing). For civilizational
memory, Hangzhou is the **pre-treaty** southern capital—
imperial continuity on the move, not yet the site of
unequal treaties. The contrast with Nanjing (treaty
namesake 1842) and Shanghai (treaty port 1842) is
structural: Hangzhou entered the treaty-port system
only in 1895, after the humiliation arc was already
institutionalized elsewhere.

IV. TREATY PORT 1895 & PRC REINCORPORATION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The **Treaty of Shimonoseki (1895)** opened Hangzhou (with
other ports) to foreign trade—a **second-wave** treaty port,
not one of the original five (1842). Hangzhou thus encodes
**extended humiliation**: the framework imposed at Nanjing
(1842) was later extended to include Hangzhou; the city
was never the trigger or namesake, but it was incorporated
into the treaty-port geography. Under the PRC, Hangzhou
was reincorporated (1949); concessions ended. The city
remains a major cultural and economic node—Grand Canal
heritage, West Lake, provincial capital—without foreign
concession. The contrast with Guangzhou (first treaty
port) and Shenzhen (PRC-designed SEZ) is structural:
Hangzhou is second-wave treaty port, then PRC hub.
