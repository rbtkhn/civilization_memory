I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves Xi'an (西安), historically **Chang'an (长安)**,
as the **western capital and Silk Road terminus** of Chinese
civilizational memory: the space that served as the primary
imperial capital under the Tang and earlier dynasties, and
as the **western nexus** of the Silk Road—the inland node
where overland trade and cultural exchange converged. Xi'an
encodes **interior capital greatness**: when the center of
gravity was in the west (Tang Chang'an), it was the world’s
largest city; when the court fled Beijing (Boxer, 1900),
Xi'an was the **refuge capital**—the interior to which
the Qing retreated when the northern capital was under
siege. It was never a treaty port; no foreign concession.

Xi'an is remembered not only as a city, but as the **contrast
to coastal humiliation**: Chang'an as pre-treaty zenith;
Xi'an as refuge when Beijing fell. Under the PRC, Xi'an
is the provincial capital of Shaanxi and a major interior
cultural and transport node—no treaty-port past, continuity
of interior significance.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

II. GEOGRAPHIC & STRUCTURAL MEMORY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Xi'an sits on the Wei River (渭河) in the Guanzhong plain,
with historical importance as **Chang'an**—capital of the
Han, Sui, and Tang dynasties and the **eastern terminus**
of the Silk Road from the perspective of Central Asia (or
western terminus from the Chinese core). It is an **interior
and overland** node: not maritime, not on the treaty-port
map; its significance was **imperial and caravan**—the
capital of a unified empire and the nexus of Silk Road
trade. When the Boxer uprising led to the siege of
Beijing and the occupation of the capital (1900), the
Qing court **fled to Xi'an**—encoding Xi'an as refuge
when the northern capital could not hold.

Key structural features:
• Chang'an: Han, Sui, Tang capital; Silk Road terminus/nexus
• Boxer refuge (1900–1901): Qing court fled Beijing for Xi'an; interior redoubt
• No treaty port: never opened by unequal treaty; no foreign concession
• PRC: Shaanxi provincial capital; interior cultural and transport hub

III. CHANG'AN & SILK ROAD NEXUS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Xi'an (Chang'an) encodes **interior capital zenith**: under
the Tang, it was the world’s largest city and the eastern
anchor of the Silk Road. Trade, diplomacy, and cultural
exchange passed through Chang'an; it was the **pre-treaty**
model of a capital open to the world on imperial terms—
not on the terms of unequal treaties. The contrast with
Guangzhou (Canton—Qing monopoly then treaty port) and
Shanghai (treaty port) is structural: Chang'an was
never opened by force; it was the center from which
the empire engaged the overland world. MEM–CHINA–SILK–ROAD
depends on Chang'an/Xi'an as the Chinese terminus.

IV. BOXER REFUGE & INTERIOR REDOUBT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The **Boxer Rebellion (1900)** encoded Xi'an as **refuge
capital**: when the legations were besieged in Beijing
and Allied forces advanced, the Qing court fled to
Xi'an. The capital was lost; legitimacy retreated
inland. Xi'an thus shares with Chongqing the structural
role of **interior redoubt**—a place where authority
could hold when the primary capital was struck. The
contrast with Beijing is explicit in the Boxer narrative:
Beijing was besieged and occupied; Xi'an held the
court. For Republican and PRC narrative, the flight
to Xi'an is part of the humiliation story (the court
had to flee), but Xi'an itself was not penetrated—
interior as refuge. Under the PRC, Xi'an is reincorporated
as a major interior node; no concession; continuity
of civilizational memory.

• MEM–CHINA–BEIJING — Dependency: Contrast—Beijing capital struck (Boxer); Xi'an refuge to which court fled. Breaks if removed: loss of capital/refuge contrast.
• MEM–CHINA–DYNASTY–TANG — Dependency: Tang capital Chang'an; zenith of city. Breaks if removed: no Tang capital framing.
• MEM–CHINA–DYNASTY–QING — Dependency: Qing court at Xi'an during Boxer aftermath. Breaks if removed: no dynasty framing.
• MEM–CHINA–CHONGQING — Dependency: Contrast—Chongqing ROC wartime redoubt; Xi'an Qing Boxer refuge; both interior redoubts. Breaks if removed: loss of redoubt pairing.
• MEM–CHINA–CHENGDU — Dependency: Contrast—both interior, never treaty port; different basins (Guanzhong vs Sichuan). Breaks if removed: loss of interior-node contrast.
• MEM–CHINA–PRC — Dependency: PRC provincial capital; interior hub. Breaks if removed: no contemporary framing.
