**DERIVATION CLAUSE (BINDING):**
This doctrine registry is **derived exclusively from CIV–SCHOLAR–CHINA**. All doctrines originate from FROZEN SYNTHESIS entries in that file and were accepted via DIB–CHINA (explicit user authorization to create this file and to treat the three frozen syntheses as doctrine). No doctrine originates in this file. Doctrines 01–03 correspond to SCHOLAR–CHINA Doctrine Registry v0.1, v0.2, v0.3 (SYNTHESIS 0004, 0007, 0010). Subsequent doctrines must follow the standard admissibility chain: FROZEN SYNTHESIS in CIV–SCHOLAR–CHINA → DIB–CHINA → CIV–DOCTRINE–CHINA.

I. PURPOSE & AUTHORITY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file is the **exclusive registry of accepted China civilizational doctrines**.

It contains:
• Doctrines explicitly accepted via DIB–CHINA
• Definitions suitable for CIV–CORE citation (CIV–CORE–CHINA v3.0)
• No learning history, no beliefs, no provisional or rejected doctrines (see Section IV)

This file does NOT learn, does NOT synthesize, does NOT evolve autonomously.

Authority Flow:
CIV–MEM–CORE → CIV–CORE–CHINA → DIB–CHINA → CIV–DOCTRINE–CHINA
Source of doctrine content: CIV–SCHOLAR–CHINA (frozen syntheses only).

Doctrine Admissibility Rules (per CIV–DOCTRINE–TEMPLATE § III):
A doctrine MAY be entered here ONLY if: (1) it originates from a FROZEN SYNTHESIS in CIV–SCHOLAR–CHINA; (2) it was explicitly accepted by DIB–CHINA; (3) a doctrine number/version is assigned. Prohibited: draft doctrines, candidate beliefs, analytical hypotheses, scholar commentary, historical narration.

Only doctrines listed here may be cited as **authoritative doctrine** by CIV–CORE engines.

II. DOCTRINAL RELATIONSHIP & SEQUENCING OVERVIEW (NON-AUTHORITATIVE)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Contextual guidance only. No binding order or requirement.

• Doctrine 01 (Non-Han Consolidation: Peak Then Exhaustion) — Yuan–Qing pattern; non-Han dynasties can achieve peak reach through Sinicized administration, then exhaust when pressure and rigidity converge.
• Doctrine 02 (Rupture-to-Reconstitution) — ROC–PRC pattern; fragmentation reversed by revolutionary monopolization (party–state fusion, vertical penetration).
• Doctrine 03 (Conquest-as-Connectivity Condition) — Mongol/Pax Mongolica pattern; conquest creates structural condition for connectivity; corridors and adaptive governance outlast conquest.

Temporal relation: 01 and 03 address imperial/pre-modern layers (Yuan, Qing, Mongol); 02 addresses modern rupture and reconstitution. No mandatory application order.

III. DOCTRINE REGISTRY (AUTHORITATIVE)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

DOCTRINE 01
Name: NON-HAN CONSOLIDATION — PEAK THEN EXHAUSTION
Status: ACCEPTED · LOCKED · CANONICAL
Source:
• CIV–SCHOLAR–CHINA (SYNTHESIS 0004)

Definition:
A second non-Han dynasty can achieve peak imperial reach when it adopts Sinicized administration and multi-ethnic framework after a first conquest precedent (e.g. Yuan → Qing). Peak reach does not guarantee durability; external pressure and internal rigidity can converge irreversibly and produce systemic exhaustion.

Operational Meaning:
• Non-Han conquest can achieve peak reach through Sinicized administration and multi-ethnic framework, not ethnic homogeneity.
• Peak imperial reach depends on retention of administrative and examination institutions combined with multi-ethnic framework.
• Exhaustion is signaled when external pressure and internal rigidity converge irreversibly.

Hard Constraints:
• If non-Han conquest routinely failed to consolidate through Sinicization, the Yuan–Qing sequence would be exceptional; doctrine scope narrows.
• If peak reach required ethnic homogeneity or clean-slate replacement, Sinicized administration would be insufficient; doctrine loses explanatory value.
• If peak consistently predicted sustained durability, "converge irreversibly" would be mis-specified.

DOCTRINE 02
Name: RUPTURE-TO-RECONSTITUTION
Status: ACCEPTED · LOCKED · CANONICAL
Source:
• CIV–SCHOLAR–CHINA (SYNTHESIS 0007)

Definition:
When coercive and fiscal consolidation fail (fragmentation, warlordism, weak extraction), fragmentation can be reversed by revolutionary monopolization of coercive, administrative, and symbolic authority. Monopolization is achieved through party–state fusion and vertical penetration to village level, not through constitutional or procedural continuity. Authority is consolidated through mobilization and penetration first; normalization (stability, law) follows rather than precedes consolidation.

Operational Meaning:
• Fragmentation is reversible by revolutionary monopolization when procedural or elite continuity has already failed.
• Party–state fusion and vertical penetration are the mechanism, not liberal constitutionalism or procedural continuity.
• Consolidation precedes normalization; disruption and penetration are methods of consolidation.

Hard Constraints:
• If fragmentation were routinely irreversible, rupture-to-reconstitution would be exceptional; doctrine loses predictive value.
• If monopolization required procedural continuity or liberal constitutionalism, the pattern would be mis-specified.
• If normalization routinely preceded consolidation, the sequence would be reversed; doctrine would mis-specify order.

DOCTRINE 03
Name: CONQUEST-AS-CONNECTIVITY CONDITION
Status: ACCEPTED · LOCKED · CANONICAL
Source:
• CIV–SCHOLAR–CHINA (SYNTHESIS 0010)

Definition:
Steppe-driven conquest (mobility, system-breaking) creates the structural condition for connectivity—secure corridors, relay networks, elimination of intermediate bandits—rather than connectivity preceding conquest. Secure corridors and tolerant, adaptive multi-ethnic governance can outlast the conquest phase and produce lasting institutional legacies. The incentive to secure routes for extraction, intelligence, and trade is structural; corridor security is a rational response to scale, not ideology.

Operational Meaning:
• Conquest creates the condition for connectivity; connectivity does not routinely precede or exist independently of conquest in this pattern.
• Adaptive multi-ethnic governance and secure corridors can outlast conquest and produce institutional legacies (e.g. Yam, paiza, pragmatic universalism).
• Route security and corridor control are structural incentives, not primarily ideological choices.

Scope and Contemporary Application:
• The pattern above describes pre-modern, steppe-driven cases (Mongol
  Empire, Yuan) from which the doctrine was derived. Contemporary
  connectivity initiatives (e.g. Belt and Road) may be officially
  characterised as voluntary, non-coercive, and independent of
  conquest or coercion; that characterisation does not invalidate the
  historical pattern. Structural incentives (corridor security, route
  control) may persist regardless of official rhetoric; the doctrine
  remains applicable to historical analysis and to structural
  assessment of corridor logic where appropriate.

Hard Constraints:
• If connectivity routinely preceded or was independent of conquest, "conquest-as-condition" would be mis-specified; doctrine loses explanatory value.
• If conquest routinely destroyed institutional legacies, "outlast conquest" would be rare; doctrine scope narrows.
• If connectivity required ideological commitment to universalism, structural explanation would be overstated; mechanism would be mis-specified.

IV. EXPLICITLY EXCLUDED MATERIAL
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
No doctrines have been rejected at this stage. All doctrines in this registry were accepted from CIV–SCHOLAR–CHINA frozen syntheses via DIB–CHINA. Candidate beliefs, staged beliefs, and unfrozen syntheses in SCHOLAR–CHINA are not doctrine and are excluded from this file.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. MIRRORING
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Per CIV–MEM–CORE § XVII and CIV–DOCTRINE–TEMPLATE § VIII:
CIV–DOCTRINE–CHINA is mirrored verbatim into CIV–CORE–CHINA and CIV–SCHOLAR–CHINA. Mirrored doctrines provide citation surface for CIV–CORE engines and inform SCHOLAR learning without constraining it. This file remains the single source of truth for doctrine definitions.
