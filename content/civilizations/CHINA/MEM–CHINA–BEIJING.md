I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves Beijing as the **capital node** of Chinese
civilizational memory: the space where imperial and republican
authority has been centered, where foreign legations were
imposed (Second Opium War, Boxer), and where the PRC has
concentrated party–state power—encoding both **legitimacy at
the center** and **humiliation at the center** (occupation,
Summer Palace destruction, Boxer siege and Protocol).

Beijing is remembered not only as the seat of emperors and
the Party, but as the **symbolic target** of foreign coercion:
whoever held or struck the capital signaled supremacy or
humiliation; the legation quarter and the Summer Palace
(圆明园) became fixed in strategic memory.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

II. GEOGRAPHIC & HISTORICAL MEMORY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Beijing sits in the North China Plain, with historical
importance as a northern capital (Liao, Jin, Yuan Dadu/Khanbaliq,
Ming, Qing). The Grand Canal was extended to supply it; the
Great Wall lies to the north. Control of Beijing implied
control of the northern realm; loss of Beijing implied
loss of legitimacy or flight (Boxer: court fled to Xi'an;
Second Opium: court fled to Rehe).

Key structural features:
• Imperial capital (Ming–Qing): Forbidden City, Summer Palace
• Legation quarter (from 1860): foreign diplomatic presence
  imposed by Convention of Beijing; besieged in Boxer uprising (1900)
• PRC capital (1949–): Party–state center; Tiananmen; no foreign
  military presence

III. HUMILIATION AT THE CENTER
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The **Second Opium War** (1860) brought Anglo-French forces to
Beijing; the court fled; the **Summer Palace was destroyed**.
The **Boxer Rebellion** (1900) saw the siege of the legations,
Alliance relief and occupation, and the Boxer Protocol—foreign
troops stationed in the capital, indemnity, punishment of
officials. Beijing thus encodes **humiliation at the center**:
the capital was penetrated, the court was forced to flee or
capitulate, and foreign presence was institutionalized. For
Republican and PRC narrative, Beijing as site of legations and
Summer Palace destruction is part of the "century of humiliation."

IV. PRC CAPITAL & RECONSTITUTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The PRC made Beijing the capital in 1949, recentering authority
after Republican fragmentation. No foreign legations or troops
impose terms; the Party–state concentrates power at the center.
Tiananmen and the Forbidden City serve as symbolic and
administrative nodes. Beijing thus also encodes **reconstitution**:
the capital is again the undisputed seat of Chinese state power—
no occupation, no Protocol imposed from outside. The contrast
with Boxer-era Beijing is structural: then, foreign troops in
the capital; now, Party–state monopoly.
