I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves **Bohai (渤海)** and its relation to the **Tang**
as the **frontier tributary–rival dual encoding** of Chinese
civilizational memory: a polity that was at once **recognized by**
the centre (tributary legitimacy) and **in contest with** it (rival
by force). Bohai (698–926)—a Mohe–Goguryeo derived state extending
from the Sungari–Amur region south into northern Korea—received
Tang recognition in 713 but fought the Tang in 732–735. The same
relationship held **both** dimensions; neither cancels the other.
This dual encoding is required per RLL–CHINA–0002.

Bohai is remembered not as "tributary only" or "rival only" but as
**frontier polity**: periphery that could be both recognised and
contested. Liao conquered Bohai in 926; the Amur basin became Liao
northern hinterland. The MEM does not resolve the encoding; it
preserves the tension.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

II. BOHAI STATE & GEOGRAPHY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Bohai (渤海, Balhae in Korean historiography) was founded in 698
by former Goguryeo and Mohe (靺鞨) elites in the Sungari–Amur
region and expanded south toward the northern Korean peninsula.
It was a **frontier state**—not a Chinese dynasty, not a steppe
khanate—with a mixed institutional and cultural profile. The Amur
basin was its **northern periphery**; the Tang saw the region as
**outer frontier**, the northern edge of Tang reach. Structurally,
the balance of power on the frontier allowed neither side to
finish the other: Tang could not absorb Bohai; Bohai could not
replace the Tang. The result was **coexistence with contest**—
recognition and war within the same relationship.

Key structural features:
• Bohai 698–926: Mohe–Goguryeo state; Sungari–Amur to northern Korea
• Tang recognition 713: Bohai granted formal recognition (tributary status)
• Bohai–Tang war 732–735: military conflict; same polity, same frontier
• Liao conquest 926: Khitan destroyed Bohai; Amur basin became Liao hinterland

III. TRIBUTARY–RIVAL DUAL ENCODING (RLL–CHINA–0002)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The **dual encoding** is explicit: the same polity (Bohai) and the
same relationship (Bohai–Tang) can be read as **tributary**
(legitimacy through recognition by the centre—Tang recognition
713) and as **rival** (contest through force—war 732–735). The MEM
must not assert a single fixed role. Where recognition and contest
coexist, both dimensions are visible.

In 713 the Tang court granted Bohai recognition—incorporating it
into the tributary order and granting its ruler a title. That
encoded **legitimacy through the centre**: Bohai existed within
the framework of Tang-centred diplomacy. In 732–735 Bohai and Tang
fought: Bohai attacked Tang positions; the Tang responded. That
encoded **contest**: the same frontier polity was now rival. The
two facts are not contradictory in the civilizational grammar;
they are **dual aspects** of frontier relations. Periphery polities
can be both recognised and contested; the centre can grant
legitimacy and still fight. RLL–CHINA–0002 requires that this
possibility be encoded wherever frontier or tributary relations
are thematised.

IV. LIAO CONQUEST & LEGACY
────────────────────────────────────────────
Liao (Khitan) conquered Bohai in 926. The Amur basin passed from
Bohai to Liao northern hinterland; later Jurchen/Jin would rise
from the same general region. Bohai thus encodes **frontier
succession**: not Chinese dynastic succession, but periphery
polity replaced by another periphery polity (Liao), then by
Jurchen (Jin). The Tang–Bohai dual encoding outlasted neither—
Tang fell in 907; Bohai in 926—but the **pattern** (tributary and
rival on the same frontier) persists in the Amur and Manchurian
memory. MEM–CHINA–GEO–AMUR–RIVER holds the geographic frame;
this MEM holds the Bohai–Tang relation as the named instance.

• MEM–CHINA–GEO–AMUR–RIVER — Dependency: Amur/Sungari as Bohai northern periphery; pre-1500 frontier; tributary–rival in II-B. Breaks if removed: no geographic framing.
• MEM–CHINA–DYNASTY–TANG — Dependency: Tang as centre; recognition 713, war 732–735. Breaks if removed: no centre framing.
• MEM–CHINA–DYNASTY–LIAO — Dependency: Liao conquered Bohai 926; Amur basin became Liao hinterland. Breaks if removed: no successor framing.
• MEM–CHINA–DYNASTY–JIN — Dependency: Jurchen/Jin rose from Manchuria (Sungari–Amur); Bohai region as later power base. Breaks if removed: loss of regional succession.
