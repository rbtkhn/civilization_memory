I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves the Yellow River (黄河, Huang He) as the **North
China heartland and cradle corridor** of Chinese civilizational
memory: the space where early Chinese civilization emerged, where
northern capitals were supplied (via the Grand Canal from Yangtze
grain), and where **flood and course change** repeatedly imposed
disaster and reengineering—encoding both **cradle** and **hazard**.
The Yellow River is the **northern arm** of the Yellow–Yangtze axis;
the Grand Canal links it to the Yangtze and to Beijing (Dadu). Control
of the Yellow River basin implied control of the North China Plain;
control of the Canal link implied capital supply.

The Yellow River is remembered as **cradle and hazard logic**: the
river that gave the plain its fertility and its identity also
imposed catastrophic floods and course shifts; legitimacy and
state capacity were tested by flood control and canal supply.
Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

II. GEOGRAPHIC & STRUCTURAL MEMORY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Yellow River (黄河) rises on the Tibetan Plateau and flows east
and north through Qinghai, Gansu, Ningxia, Inner Mongolia, Shaanxi,
Shanxi, Henan, Shandong—emptying into the Bohai Sea. It traverses
the **North China Plain**; its basin was the core of early Chinese
state formation (Xia, Shang, Zhou, Qin, Han). Key structural
features: **flood and course change**—the river has shifted its
lower course repeatedly; **Grand Canal**—historically linked to
the Yellow River and extended to Beijing (Yuan); **grain supply**—Canal
brought Yangtze grain north to supply capitals (Luoyang, Kaifeng,
Beijing). Xi'an (Chang'an) lies in the Wei River valley, a Yellow
River tributary system.

Key structural features:
• Cradle: North China Plain as heartland of early Chinese civilization; Yellow River basin as core
• Hazard: catastrophic floods; course changes; dyke and canal engineering as state imperative
• Capital supply: Grand Canal links Yellow River to Yangtze and to Beijing; grain (漕运) from south to north
• Chokepoint logic: control of Yellow River crossings and Canal junctions = control of north–south flow

Terrain enforces **cradle and hazard logic**: the river that sustains the plain can also destroy it; state capacity is measured by flood control and supply.

III. YELLOW RIVER AS CRADLE AND NORTH HEARTLAND
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Yellow River encodes **cradle**: the North China Plain and the
Yellow River basin were the **core** of early Chinese state formation—
Xia, Shang, Zhou, Qin, Han. Capitals (Luoyang, Kaifeng, Chang'an/Xi'an)
sat in or near the basin; the river supplied irrigation and identity.
The **contrast with the Yangtze** is structural: Yellow River = north,
heartland, early capitals; Yangtze = south, later integration, naval–
riverine and treaty-port geography. The Grand Canal **links** the two—
grain moved from Yangtze region north via Canal (and Yellow River
segments) to supply northern capitals. MEM–CHINA–GRAND–CANAL depends
on the Yellow River as the **northern arm** of the Yellow–Yangtze
corridor; MEM–CHINA–XIAN (Chang'an) sits in the Wei tributary system.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. YELLOW RIVER AS HAZARD AND SUPPLY CORRIDOR
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The same river encodes **hazard**: catastrophic floods and **course
changes** have repeatedly devastated the North China Plain; dyke
building and canal engineering were **state imperatives**—whoever
could control the river and secure grain supply could sustain
legitimacy. The Yuan extended the Grand Canal to Dadu (Beijing),
linking Yellow River (and Yangtze) to the northern capital; the
Ming and Qing maintained and rebuilt the system. The Yellow River
thus carries **both** the cradle narrative (heartland, identity)
and the hazard narrative (flood, course change, state capacity).
MEM–CHINA–BEIJING and MEM–CHINA–GRAND–CANAL depend on the Yellow
River as the northern terminus of bulk supply; MEM–CHINA–GEO–YANGTZE–RIVER
is the **southern counterpart**—one axis, two rivers linked by the
Canal.

V. MEM CONNECTIONS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• MEM–CHINA–GRAND–CANAL — Dependency: Grand Canal links Yellow River to Yangtze and Beijing; northern arm of corridor. Breaks if removed: no supply corridor framing.
• MEM–CHINA–GEO–YANGTZE–RIVER — Dependency: Contrast—Yellow River north, Yangtze south; Canal links both. Breaks if removed: loss of north–south framing.
• MEM–CHINA–BEIJING — Dependency: Capital supply via Canal from Yangtze through Yellow River corridor to Beijing. Breaks if removed: no capital supply framing.
• MEM–CHINA–XIAN — Dependency: Xi'an in Wei valley (Yellow River tributary system); Chang'an as capital. Breaks if removed: no cradle capital framing.
• MEM–CHINA–DYNASTY–QING — Dependency: Qing North China; Yellow River flood control and Canal. Breaks if removed: no dynasty framing.
• MEM–CHINA–MONGOL–KUBLAI–KHAN — Dependency: Yuan extended Canal to Dadu; Yellow River segment. Breaks if removed: no Yuan corridor framing.
• MEM–CHINA–WAR–SONG–YUAN — Dependency: North China secured (Jin fall); Canal and bulk logic. Breaks if removed: no conquest context.
• MEM–CHINA–PRC — Dependency: PRC flood control; Yellow River governance. Breaks if removed: no contemporary framing.
