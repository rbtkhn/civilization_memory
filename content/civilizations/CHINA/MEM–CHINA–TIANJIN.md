I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves Tianjin (天津) as the **treaty-port and
concession node** of Chinese civilizational memory: the space
that was opened to foreign trade and **foreign concessions**
by the Treaty of Tianjin (1858) and the Convention of Beijing
(1860)—and that became the **gateway to Beijing** for Anglo-French
forces (1860) and the Eight-Nation Alliance (1900). Tianjin
encodes **humiliation as multi-concession port**: British,
French, and later other powers held concessions; the city
was the **staging point** for the advance on the capital in
both the Second Opium War and the Boxer Rebellion. Under the
PRC, Tianjin is a direct-controlled municipality—reincorporated,
no concession; the memory of treaty port and Boxer remains.

Tianjin is remembered not only as a city, but as the **route-to-Beijing
node**: the port and railhead from which foreign forces struck
the capital in 1860 and 1900. Contrast with Beijing (capital
struck), Shanghai (dominant treaty port), and Nanjing (treaty
namesake).

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

II. GEOGRAPHIC & STRUCTURAL MEMORY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tianjin sits at the confluence of the Hai River (海河) and
the Grand Canal, near the Bohai Sea—the **port and gateway**
for Beijing. It was **not** one of the five treaty ports (1842);
it was opened by the **Treaty of Tianjin (1858)** and the
**Convention of Beijing (1860)**—the same instruments that
extended foreign presence to Beijing (legations) and led to
the destruction of the Summer Palace. Key structural features:
**concessions**—British, French, and later Japanese, German,
Russian, Belgian, Italian, Austrian-Hungarian concessions;
**route to Beijing**—Tianjin was the **staging point** for
the Anglo-French advance on Beijing (1860) and the Eight-Nation
Alliance relief of the legations (1900); **Boxer**—Alliance
forces landed at Tianjin, fought Boxer and Qing forces there,
then advanced to Beijing.

Key structural features:
• Treaty of Tianjin (1858): opened Tianjin; extended treaty ports; legations in Beijing
• Convention of Beijing (1860): confirmed Tianjin; foreign concessions; Summer Palace destroyed
• Concessions: British, French, and multiple other powers; multi-concession treaty port
• Boxer (1900): Tianjin occupied; Alliance staging point for advance to Beijing; siege and relief
• PRC: Direct-controlled municipality; reincorporated 1949; no concession

III. TREATY PORT & ROUTE TO BEIJING
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tianjin encodes **humiliation as treaty port and gateway**: the
Treaty of Tianjin (1858) and Convention of Beijing (1860) opened
Tianjin and established **foreign concessions**—British, French,
and later others. Tianjin was **not** the treaty namesake (Nanjing
1842) or the dominant commercial port (Shanghai); it was the
**political gateway**—the port from which foreign forces could
advance on the capital. In 1860, Anglo-French forces took Tianjin
and advanced to Beijing; the court fled; the Summer Palace was
destroyed. In 1900, the Eight-Nation Alliance landed at Tianjin,
fought Boxer and Qing forces there, and advanced to relieve the
legations in Beijing. For Republican and PRC narrative, Tianjin
is evidence that humiliation was **spatial**—the route from
the coast to the capital passed through Tianjin; control of
Tianjin enabled the strike on Beijing. The contrast with
Shanghai (commercial dominance) and Nanjing (treaty namesake)
is structural: Tianjin is **route-to-capital** node.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. BOXER NODE & PRC REINCORPORATION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The **Boxer Rebellion (1900)** encoded Tianjin as **Boxer node**:
the Alliance assembled at Tianjin, fought for control of the
city, then advanced to Beijing. Tianjin was **occupied**; the
siege of the legations in Beijing was relieved from the Tianjin
axis. The Boxer Protocol (1901) did not cede Tianjin, but the
city had been the **theater** of foreign military action and
remained a multi-concession port until 1949. Under the PRC,
Tianjin was reincorporated (1949); concessions ended. The
city is now a direct-controlled municipality—port, industry,
Grand Canal node—without foreign concession. The contrast
with Beijing (capital struck, legations) is structural: Tianjin
was the **gateway**; Beijing was the **target**. MEM–CHINA–BEIJING,
MEM–CHINA–WAR–SECOND–OPIUM, MEM–CHINA–WAR–BOXER–REBELLION
depend on Tianjin as the route-to-capital node.
