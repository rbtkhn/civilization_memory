I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves Hong Kong (香港) as the **territorial cession**
of Chinese civilizational memory: the space **ceded** to Britain
by the Treaty of Nanjing (1842)—the first unequal treaty—as
part of the settlement that ended the First Opium War. Hong
Kong Island was ceded in 1842; Kowloon in 1860 (Convention
of Beijing); the New Territories were leased in 1898. For
over a century it was a **British colony**—encoding **humiliation
as territorial loss**: not merely a treaty port (trade, concession),
but **sovereign territory** transferred by treaty. The handover
(1997) and establishment of the Hong Kong SAR under "one country,
two systems" encode **reconstitution**: territory returned;
PRC sovereignty asserted; different legal and administrative
status preserved by PRC design, not foreign imposition.

Hong Kong is remembered not only as a city-territory, but as
the **contrast to treaty ports and SEZs**: Guangzhou and
Shanghai were opened, not ceded; Shenzhen was created by
the PRC as an SEZ. Hong Kong was **lost**—then **returned**.
The same Pearl River delta—but Hong Kong was the piece
that was taken away.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

II. GEOGRAPHIC & STRUCTURAL MEMORY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Hong Kong sits at the mouth of the Pearl River (珠江), adjacent
to Guangdong and to Shenzhen. It was a minor Qing-era
settlement before 1842; the **Treaty of Nanjing (1842)** ceded
Hong Kong Island to Britain. The **Convention of Beijing (1860)**
ceded Kowloon; the **Convention for the Extension of Hong Kong
(1898)** leased the New Territories for 99 years. Structurally,
Hong Kong encodes **cession**: territory removed from Qing
sovereignty by unequal treaty—unlike the five treaty ports
(1842), where trade and concessions were imposed but
territory was not transferred in perpetuity.

Key structural features:
• Cession (1842): Hong Kong Island ceded by Treaty of Nanjing; first territorial loss to treaty
• Colony (1842–1997): British administration; entrepôt; contrast with mainland treaty ports
• Handover (1997): PRC sovereignty; Hong Kong SAR; "one country, two systems"
• Pearl River delta: adjacency to Guangzhou, Shenzhen; same delta, different sovereignty history

III. TREATY CESSION & TERRITORIAL LOSS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Hong Kong encodes **humiliation as cession**: the Treaty of
Nanjing (1842) did not only open five ports and impose
indemnity—it **ceded** Hong Kong Island to Britain. The
city's name is thus fixed to the **first territorial
transfer** of the humiliation arc. For Republican and
PRC narrative, Hong Kong is evidence that humiliation
was not only commercial (treaty ports) but **territorial**—
land taken by treaty. The contrast with Guangzhou
(treaty port, not ceded) and Shanghai (treaty port,
concessions, not ceded) is structural: Hong Kong was
the piece of the delta that was **lost**. Macau (Portuguese)
followed a different chronology; Hong Kong was the
British cession that anchored the Pearl River to
colonial memory.

IV. HANDOVER 1997 & SAR RECONSTITUTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The **handover (1997)** returned Hong Kong to PRC sovereignty
as a Special Administrative Region (SAR). "One country, two
systems" was a **PRC-designed** framework—not imposed by
Britain; the Basic Law and the 50-year (nominally) arrangement
were negotiated under the shadow of the expiring New
Territories lease (1997). Hong Kong thus also encodes
**reconstitution**: territory recovered; sovereignty
asserted; the same delta that had been ceded was
again under Chinese sovereignty. **Return** is the
legitimacy claim: territory restored, sovereignty
reasserted—the same delta that was ceded is again
Chinese. The contrast with Shenzhen (PRC-designed
SEZ, never lost) is structural: Shenzhen was created
by the PRC next to British Hong Kong; after 1997,
both are PRC—one SAR, one direct-controlled city.
MEM–CHINA–GEO–PEARL–RIVER frames the delta; Hong
Kong is the cession node within it.
