I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves Nanjing (南京) as the **treaty-namesake and
southern capital** of Chinese civilizational memory: the space
where the Qing signed the **Treaty of Nanjing (1842)** ending
the First Opium War—the document that opened five treaty ports
and fixed the city’s name to **capitulation**. Nanjing is thus
the **structural site of the first unequal treaty**: the place
where the Qing formally yielded to British demands. Later it
became the ROC capital (1927–1937, 1946–1949); its **fall in
1937** (Japanese capture, Nanking Massacre) encoded humiliation
at the level of the southern capital—contrast to Beijing (northern
capital struck in 1860, 1900) and to Chongqing (interior redoubt
when Nanjing fell).

Nanjing is remembered not only as a city, but as the **treaty
and massacre node**: the name on the document that opened the
humiliation arc, and the site where the ROC capital was taken
and atrocities committed. Under the PRC, Nanjing is a major
Yangtze megacity—reincorporated, no concession; the memory
of 1842 and 1937 remains.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

II. GEOGRAPHIC & STRUCTURAL MEMORY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Nanjing sits on the lower Yangtze (长江), with historical
importance as a southern capital (Six Dynasties, early Ming
before move to Beijing). It is a **riverine and political**
node: control of the Yangtze at Nanjing implied control of
the southern approach to the heartland; loss of Nanjing
implied loss of the southern capital or flight (1937: ROC
retreated to Chongqing). The **Treaty of Nanjing** was signed
there in 1842 aboard a British vessel—the city’s name
attached to the first of the “unequal treaties.”

Key structural features:
• Treaty of Nanjing (1842): end of First Opium War; five treaty ports; indemnity; Hong Kong ceded
• ROC capital (1927–1937, 1946–1949): southern seat of Republican government
• Fall of Nanjing (1937): Japanese capture; Nanking Massacre; ROC government fled to Chongqing
• PRC megacity: Yangtze hub; reincorporated 1949; no concession

III. TREATY NAMESAKE & CAPITULATION SITE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Nanjing encodes **humiliation as treaty namesake**: the
document that ended the First Opium War and opened the
treaty-port system was named for the city where the Qing
capitulated. Canton had been the trigger (Lin Zexu, 1839);
Nanjing was the **signing site**—the place where the first
unequal treaty was concluded. For Republican and PRC
narrative, Nanjing 1842 is the **institutional opener**
of the humiliation arc at the level of the written
treaty: the city’s name is fixed to that moment. The
contrast with Beijing (capital struck, legations) and
Shanghai (treaty port that rose to dominance) is
structural: Nanjing gave its name to the framework;
Shanghai and Guangzhou were among the five ports
that framework opened.

IV. FALL OF NANJING 1937 & ROC REDOUBT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The **fall of Nanjing (1937)** encoded a second layer of
humiliation: the ROC capital was taken by Japanese forces;
atrocities followed; the government fled upriver to
Chongqing. Nanjing thus also encodes **capital lost and
retreat**: when the southern capital fell, legitimacy
retreated to the interior (Chongqing). The contrast with
Chongqing is structural: Nanjing fell; Chongqing held.
For PRC narrative, 1937 is part of the “century of
humiliation”—the southern capital penetrated, the
population subjected to violence. Under the PRC,
Nanjing is reincorporated; the memory of 1842 and
1937 is preserved without foreign presence.
