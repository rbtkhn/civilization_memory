I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves the **Boxer Rebellion** as the **climactic
collision** of late Qing China with the West: an anti-foreign,
anti-Christian uprising that drew in the Qing court, led to the
siege of the foreign legations in Beijing, and ended with
**Eight-Nation Alliance** intervention, occupation, and the
Boxer Protocol (1901)—indemnity, punishment of officials,
and permanent foreign military presence in the capital.

The war is remembered not as a conventional state-on-state
conflict, but as **asymmetric humiliation**: indigenous
violence against foreigners and Christians, then coalition
retaliation that fixed the "century of humiliation" in
Chinese strategic memory.

CIV–SCHOLAR–CHINA SYNTHESIS 0005 encodes this outcome: late Qing external pressure and court vacillation produced defeat that fixed the "century of humiliation" narrative in strategic memory; DOCTRINE v0.2 (Rupture-to-Reconstitution) and SDI 0001/0002 (China ↔ Anglia defeat/authority) depend on Boxer as reference point.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

II. STRUCTURAL LOGIC: ENCROACHMENT & REACTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Structurally, the Boxer War was the **convergence** of three
forces: (1) foreign imperial encroachment—concessions, railroads,
missionaries, gunboats; (2) Qing court weakness and vacillation—
initially tolerating then briefly endorsing the Boxers, then
capitulating; (3) coalition incentive to punish and extract—
the Alliance had the power to impose terms and did. The balance
of power favored the coalition; the Qing could not defend the
capital or resist the Protocol. The **incentive** for the
Alliance was to secure reparations and guarantee future access;
the **incentive** for the court was survival—accept the Protocol,
preserve the dynasty a few more years.

No single actor "chose" the Boxer War; structural pressures—
encroachment, court illegitimacy, popular anti-foreign rage—
produced the uprising; coalition capability produced the outcome.

III. THE UPRISING & SIEGE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Boxers (义和团)—anti-foreign, anti-Christian militia—
spread across North China in 1899–1900. They attacked
missionaries, converts, and railroads; in June 1900 they
entered Beijing with tacit and then explicit court support.
The foreign legations were besieged for roughly 55 days;
the Qing declared war on the powers. The **Eight-Nation
Alliance** (Austria-Hungary, France, Germany, Italy, Japan,
Russia, United Kingdom, United States) assembled an
expeditionary force, relieved the legations in August 1900,
and occupied Beijing. The court fled to Xi'an; negotiations
led to the Boxer Protocol (1901).

Key structural facts:
• Qing court first suppressed, then endorsed Boxers—**legitimacy
  vacillation** that left the dynasty exposed when the Alliance won.
• Coalition had **overwhelming force**—modern rifles, artillery,
  logistics—against Boxer irregulars and divided Qing units.
• Outcome: indemnity (庚子赔款), execution/punishment of officials,
  foreign troops stationed in Beijing, prohibition of anti-foreign
  organizations.

IV. SOURCE EVIDENCE — KISSINGER (ARC–CHINA)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Henry Kissinger, *On China* (Penguin Press, 2011) (ARC–CHINA–T–MODERN):

"China is singular. No other country can claim so long a continuous civilization, or such an intimate link to its ancient past and classical principles of strategy and statesmanship."

"The Chinese ideal stressed subtlety, indirection, and the patient accumulation of relative advantage. The Western tradition prized the decisive clash of forces."

IV.C. SOURCE EVIDENCE — KEEGAN (CIVILIZATION-CONTRAST)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

John Keegan, *A History of Warfare* (Alfred A. Knopf, 1993) (ARC–CHINA–T–MODERN):

"The Thirty Years War... tore away the customary restraints on violence."

John Keegan, *The Mask of Command* (Jonathan Cape, 1987) — applied insight (belief collapse):

"When the Guard retreated, the army knew the battle was lost. The retreat became a rout not because of further combat but because belief had collapsed."

— Keegan on restraint torn and belief collapse: the court's **flight to Xi'an** when the Alliance relieved the legations and occupied Beijing is belief collapse at the level of the sovereign—when the court left, the capital was lost. The Boxer Protocol (indemnity, executions, foreign garrisons in the capital) **tore away customary restraints** on the inviolability of the sovereign seat. The 55-day siege of the legations encodes the "face of battle"—confinement, supply, relief—while court vacillation then flight encodes **mask failure**: no coherent command; the sovereign departed. Encoding divergence: MEM encodes humiliation and vacillation; Keegan supplies military-historian lens (belief collapse, restraint torn, siege as battle).

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. LEGITIMACY & STRATEGIC MEMORY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Boxer War **encoded** the humiliation narrative: China had
been unable to resist foreign imposition; the court had
vacillated and lost. For later Chinese elites (Republican,
PRC), the Boxer Protocol and the indemnity became **evidence**
of the century of humiliation—a frame that persists in
official and popular memory. The war did not cause the fall
of the Qing (1912), but it **accelerated** loss of legitimacy
and demonstrated that the dynasty could not protect the realm
from foreign force.

No moral verdict—structural outcome. The Boxers lost; the
Alliance imposed terms; the Qing survived only briefly.

VII. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Boxer War = convergence of encroachment, court vacillation, coalition retaliation.
• Qing could not defend capital or resist Protocol; balance of power favored Alliance.
• Siege of legations and Protocol fixed "century of humiliation" in strategic memory.
• Court endorsement then abandonment of Boxers exposed legitimacy collapse.
• Indemnity and foreign garrisons accelerated Qing loss of legitimacy; dynasty fell 1912.

Tension preserved without verdict.
