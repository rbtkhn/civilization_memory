I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves the **Mongol/Yuan conquest of the Song** as the
**naval–riverine pivot** within Chinese civilizational memory: the
campaign in which Kublai Khan turned from steppe and overland warfare
to **maritime and riverine force**—Grand Canal, junks, Yangtze—to
defeat the Southern Song and unify China under the Yuan.

The war is remembered not as a cavalry victory, but as a **structural
shift**: whoever controlled the Yangtze and the sea lanes could
sustain and project force against the Song; the Mongols built that
capacity and used it.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. STRUCTURAL LOGIC: LAND VS WATER
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Structurally, the Song could not be finished from the steppe alone.
Southern Song held the Yangtze valley, the coast, and the commercial
surplus; overland invasion had to cross rivers and face Song naval
and fortified positions. The **incentive** for Kublai was to add
naval and riverine capacity—ships, canal extension, ports—so that
bulk logistics and siege could be sustained. The balance of power
favored the side that could **also** fight on water.

Weatherford frames the pivot in terms of movement and bulk:

> "Despite the initial reliance of commerce on routes created through military conquest, it soon became obvious that whereas armies moved quickest by horse across land, massive quantities of goods moved best by water. Mongols expanded and lengthened the Grand Canal that already connected the Yellow and Yangtze Rivers to transport grain and other agricultural products farther and more efficiently into the northern districts."
> — Jack Weatherford, *Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World* (Crown, 2004) (ARC–CHINA–T–MODERN).

Land for speed; water for bulk. The Yuan built both.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. NAVAL BUILDUP & XIANGYANG
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Kublai promoted large-scale naval and riverine construction: junks,
ports, and the use of the Grand Canal for military supply. The siege
of Xiangyang (1268–1273) became the **decisive node**—a joint
naval–ground operation that broke Song resistance along the Han and
Yangtze. After Xiangyang, Yuan forces could project downriver and
along the coast; Song collapse followed.

Weatherford on Yuan maritime capacity:

> "Khubilai Khan promoted the building of ever larger seagoing junks to carry heavy loads of cargo and ports to handle them."
> — Jack Weatherford, *Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World* (Crown, 2004) (ARC–CHINA–T–MODERN).

> "Marco Polo, who sailed from China to Persia on his return home, described the Mongol ships as large four-masted junks with up to three hundred crewmen and as many as sixty cabins for merchants carrying various wares. … Khubilai Khan promoted the building of ever larger seagoing junks to carry heavy loads of cargo and ports to handle them. They improved the use of the compass in navigation and learned to produce more accurate nautical charts. The route from the port of Zaytun in southern China to Hormuz in the Persian Gulf became the main sea link between the Far East and the Middle East, and was used by both Marco Polo and Ibn Battuta, among others."
> — Jack Weatherford, *Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World* (Crown, 2004) (ARC–CHINA–T–MODERN).

Naval capacity built for the Song campaign outlasted the war—Zaytun–Hormuz, compass, charts—and became part of Yuan and post-Yuan connectivity.

Jack Weatherford, *Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World* (Crown, 2004) (ARC–CHINA–T–MODERN):

"Despite the initial reliance of commerce on routes created through military conquest, it soon became obvious that whereas armies moved quickest by horse across land, massive quantities of goods moved best by water. Mongols expanded and lengthened the Grand Canal that already connected the Yellow and Yangtze Rivers to transport grain and other agricultural products farther and more efficiently into the northern districts."

"Khubilai Khan promoted the building of ever larger seagoing junks to carry heavy loads of cargo and ports to handle them."

"The route from the port of Zaytun in southern China to Hormuz in the Persian Gulf became the main sea link between the Far East and the Middle East, and was used by both Marco Polo and Ibn Battuta, among others."

— Weatherford on Song–Yuan conquest: land vs water logistics; Grand Canal; Yuan naval buildup; Zaytun–Hormuz. *Emperor of the Seas* (2024) to be added for maritime legitimacy and Xiangyang narrative when verbatim available. ARC–CHINA v1.0.

**Marco Polo — *Il Milione*** (ships of Manzi / Yuan maritime capacity):

> "The ships which sail in the Indian Seas are built of fir. They have but one deck, and above this deck there are in most cases more than sixty cabins, and in some cases more; and each of these cabins can accommodate one merchant very comfortably. They have one rudder and four masts, and often they have two masts more which can be shipped or unshipped at will. The larger vessels have thirteen divisions or bulkheads in the hold, made of strong planks fitted together, so that if the ship spring a leak in one place the hold is not flooded."
> — Marco Polo, *Il Milione*, Bk III Ch I, "Of the Merchant Ships of Manzi that sail upon the Indian Seas" (trans. Yule, 1903). ARC–CHINA v1.0.

Contemporary witness to Yuan-era shipping capacity; complements Weatherford on junks and Zaytun–Hormuz.

IV.B. SOURCE EVIDENCE — KEEGAN (CIVILIZATION-CONTRAST)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

John Keegan, *A History of Warfare* (Alfred A. Knopf, 1993) (ARC–CHINA–T–MODERN):

"Clausewitz is the most important writer on war... but his vision was formed by a particular historical moment. He knew nothing of primitive war, little of oriental war, and his theory rests on assumptions about the rationality of politics that history often contradicts."

John Keegan, *The Mask of Command* (Jonathan Cape, 1987) — applied insight (belief collapse):

"When the Guard retreated, the army knew the battle was lost. The retreat became a rout not because of further combat but because belief had collapsed."

— Keegan on the limits of Clausewitzian theory: Song–Yuan conquest (steppe–maritime, dynastic unification) falls outside European rational-politics assumptions—"little of oriental war." Belief collapse: when Xiangyang fell (1273), Song resistance downstream lost its linchpin; the polity "knew" the southern barrier was broken. No single commander fled like Darius; the structural analogue is the fall of the key node and the fragmentation that followed. Encoding divergence: MEM encodes naval–riverine pivot; Keegan supplies military-historian lens (belief collapse, war-making culture).

V. OUTCOME & LEGITIMACY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Yuan victory (1279) eliminated the Song and gave Kublai **unified**
China—the first time a non-Han dynasty ruled all of China proper.
The conquest was the **condition** for Yuan legitimacy as emperor of
China; maritime and riverine capacity were the **means**. The war
encodes the lesson: control the rivers and the coast, and the
southern polity cannot hold.

No moral verdict—structural outcome. The Song fell because the
balance of power shifted to a polity that could fight on both land
and water.

VII. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Song could not be defeated from the steppe alone; naval/riverine capacity was necessary.
• Land for speed, water for bulk; Grand Canal and junks enabled sustained siege and logistics.
• Xiangyang as decisive node; joint naval–ground campaign broke Song resistance.
• Yuan naval capacity outlasted the war (Zaytun–Hormuz, compass, charts).
• Control rivers and coast → southern polity cannot hold; structural lesson.

Tension preserved without verdict.
