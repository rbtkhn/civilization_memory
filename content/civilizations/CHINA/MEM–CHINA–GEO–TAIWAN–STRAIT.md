I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves the Taiwan Strait (台湾海峡) as the **maritime
corridor and political divide** of Chinese civilizational memory:
the shallow, weather-volatile water body between the mainland
(Fujian) and Taiwan—a space that has functioned as **barrier**
and **connector**. Historically, the strait permitted migration
and trade (Han settlement of Taiwan, Qing incorporation) but
also imposed discontinuity ("governance across the sea is
difficult to sustain"). Since 1949, the strait has been the
**de facto boundary** between the PRC and the ROC—encoding
political rupture: one civilizational frame, two regimes,
one narrow sea. The strait connects the South China Sea
(south) to the East China Sea (north); it is thus part of
the **first island chain** logic—whoever controls the strait
or its shores shapes maritime projection.

The Taiwan Strait is remembered as **cross-strait logic**:
proximity without political closure; water as both link
and separator. Contradictions are preserved without
synthesis.

II. GEOGRAPHIC & STRUCTURAL MEMORY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Taiwan Strait runs north–south between the mainland
(Fujian province) and Taiwan (台湾), roughly 180 km at
its narrowest. It is **shallow** (shelf sea) and **weather-
volatile** (typhoons, monsoon). To the north it opens
into the East China Sea; to the south it connects to
the South China Sea. Key structural features: **short
distance** (crossing feasible) but **political distance**
(1949–present: two governments, no peace treaty); **shipping
lanes** (trade and military); **first island chain**—the
strait is the gap between the mainland and Taiwan,
through which mainland projection toward the Pacific
must pass or be constrained.

Key structural features:
• Narrow and shallow: crossing feasible; migration and trade historically possible
• Weather-volatile: typhoons and monsoon; water imposes operational and symbolic discontinuity
• Political divide (1949–): PRC (mainland) vs ROC (Taiwan); no peace treaty; de facto boundary
• Maritime corridor: connects South China Sea and East China Sea; first island chain node

Strategic axiom (from MEM–CHINA–TAIWAN):
> "隔海而治，难以久控。"
(Governance across the sea is difficult to sustain.)

III. STRAIT AS BARRIER AND MIGRATION CORRIDOR
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Taiwan Strait encodes **dual logic**: (1) **Connector**—
Han migration from Fujian/Guangdong to Taiwan; Qing
incorporation (1683); trade and fishing. The strait
was crossable; it linked rather than only divided.
(2) **Barrier**—typhoons, piracy, and weak imperial
penetration made Taiwan a "overseas, lightly governed
land" (海外荒服); the strait imposed **administrative
distance**. MEM–CHINA–TAIWAN depends on the strait
as the geographic fact that separates Taiwan from the
mainland—the space across which "governance is difficult
to sustain." Colonial discontinuity (Japan 1895–1945)
and post-1949 regime split reinforced the strait as
**political** barrier: the same water that had allowed
migration became the line between two Chinas.

IV. STRAIT AS POLITICAL DIVIDE AND STRATEGIC CHOKEPOINT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Since **1949**, the Taiwan Strait has encoded **regime
divide**: PRC on the mainland, ROC on Taiwan; no
peace treaty; periodic crises (1950s, 1995–1996,
contemporary). The strait is the **de facto boundary**
between two sovereign claims—one asserting one
China, one defending de facto autonomy. Strategically,
the strait is part of **first island chain** logic:
mainland naval and air projection toward the Pacific
passes through or near the strait; Taiwan controls
the eastern shore. Whoever holds Taiwan shapes
who can use the strait for breakout or containment.
MEM–CHINA–TAIWAN (island) and MEM–CHINA–GEO–
SOUTH–CHINA–SEA (sea to the south) frame the strait;
this file is the **corridor** that defines the
cross-strait relationship. MEM–CHINA–PRC and
MEM–CHINA–ROC are the **regime MEMs**; the strait
is the **geographic condition** of their divide.

V. MEM CONNECTIONS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• MEM–CHINA–TAIWAN — Dependency: Taiwan Strait separates Taiwan from mainland; MEM–CHINA–TAIWAN cites strait. Breaks if removed: no island framing.
• MEM–CHINA–PRC — Dependency: PRC mainland shore; cross-strait policy; sovereignty claims. Breaks if removed: no mainland framing.
• MEM–CHINA–ROC — Dependency: ROC on Taiwan; cross-strait policy; 1949 divide. Breaks if removed: no Taiwan regime framing.
• MEM–CHINA–GEO–SOUTH–CHINA–SEA — Dependency: Taiwan Strait connects to South China Sea (south); same maritime theatre. Breaks if removed: no sea framing.
• MEM–CHINA–GEO–EAST–CHINA–SEA — Dependency: Taiwan Strait connects to East China Sea (north); first island chain and maritime corridor. Breaks if removed: no northern-sea framing.
• MEM–CHINA–DYNASTY–QING — Dependency: Qing incorporation of Taiwan 1683; strait as migration and governance corridor. Breaks if removed: no dynasty framing.
• MEM–CHINA–HONG–KONG — Dependency: Contrast—Pearl River delta (cession, handover) vs Taiwan Strait (political divide, no handover). Breaks if removed: loss of contrast.
• MEM–CHINA–GUANGZHOU — Dependency: Historic migration from Guangdong across strait to Taiwan. Breaks if removed: no migration framing.
• MEM–CHINA–GEO–PEARL–RIVER — Dependency: Contrast—Pearl River delta (single sovereignty post-1997) vs Taiwan Strait (two regimes). Breaks if removed: loss of delta–strait contrast.
