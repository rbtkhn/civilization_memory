I. PURPOSE & AUTHORITY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
(Implements CIV–SCHOLAR–TEMPLATE v2.10 § I)

CIV–SCHOLAR–CHINA is the accumulative learning ledger of the China civilization.

It is not a strategist. It is not a governor. It is not an interpreter. It has no innate cognition. It makes no assumptions. It records learning events, not conclusions.

This file preserves: what was ingested; when it was ingested; what beliefs were extracted; how beliefs were synthesized; which beliefs were frozen into doctrine. No belief exists here unless explicitly derived. No synthesis exists here unless explicitly recorded. No doctrine exists here unless explicitly frozen. All cognition is historical and procedural, never intrinsic.

Authority Flow (NON-REVERSIBLE): CIV–MEM–CORE → CIV–MEM–TEMPLATE → CIV–SCHOLAR–TEMPLATE → CIV–SCHOLAR–CHINA. No Scholar file may override MEM law, ARC law, or Template law.

CIV–CORE–CHINA v2.0 governs diagnostic outputs (MSI, PLS, SOC, EAL, AT, LCF, IRR, EAC, Compute Sovereignty, Spatial Integrity, Escalation Stability, EPV, Time Advantage, Axis Optionality, SAF-CH, GRID-CH, RIR-CH). This Scholar records learning; it does not replace CORE logic.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. SCHOLAR PHASE MODEL (HARD)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
(Implements CIV–SCHOLAR–TEMPLATE v2.10 § II)

This file operates in **PHASE I — ACCUMULATION**.

Permitted: Learning ingestion; pattern recognition; comparative notes; tension recording; hypothesis staging (non-binding). Forbidden: Doctrine creation; verdicts; system claims; teleology. RLLs may be drafted but are NOT binding in this phase. Phase II (Constraint Grammar) and Phase III (Snapshot) are activated only by explicit user authorization per Template.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. RLL AUTHORITY / DOCTRINE REGISTRY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
(Implements CIV–SCHOLAR–TEMPLATE v2.10 § III; Phase I)

In Phase I, RLLs are not binding. This file uses a **Doctrine Registry** (frozen synthesis outcomes) as the Phase I equivalent of recorded constraint objects. Doctrine entries will carry Assumptions Boxes and Confidence tier per Template § XIV when frozen. If Phase II is adopted, RLL–CHINA–#### namespace and binding rules apply per Template § III.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. FAILURE-FIRST STANDARD (PHASE II; PHASE I EXEMPT)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
(Implements CIV–SCHOLAR–TEMPLATE v2.10 § IV)

Phase II requires failure-first reasoning, negative-capability framing, and sequencing enforcement. Phase I (current) is exempt. When Phase II is activated, Section IV will govern reasoning order per Template.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. NON-SYNTHESIS RULE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
(Implements CIV–SCHOLAR–TEMPLATE v2.10 § V)

Scholar files may record contradictions, juxtapose models, preserve tensions. They may not resolve contradictions, harmonize models, or produce unified theories. Constraint-oriented synthesis (failure-pattern, sequencing, boundary identification) is permitted per Template and Protocol; closure-seeking synthesis is forbidden.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. SCHOLAR ↔ MEM CONFLICT HANDLING
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
(Implements CIV–SCHOLAR–TEMPLATE v2.10 § VI)

MEM facts are authoritative; SCHOLAR constraints are interpretive. When a MEM assertion contradicts an established SCHOLAR pattern, the Scholar must flag the anomaly explicitly (Anomaly Flag Protocol). Phase II requires full implementation; Phase I notes the rule. Authority substitution and silent reconciliation are forbidden.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. CIVILIZATION-SCOPED PROMOTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
(Implements CIV–SCHOLAR–TEMPLATE v2.10 § VII)

Phase promotion is civilization-local. A successful Scholar (e.g., CHINA) does not auto-upgrade other civilizations. Each civilization must independently demonstrate stable constraint binding and audit survivability for Phase II.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VIII. SNAPSHOT CLASS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
(Implements CIV–SCHOLAR–TEMPLATE v2.10 § VIII)

Snapshot naming: SCHOLAR–CHINA — SNAPSHOT — vX.Y. Snapshots are read-only, locked permanently, externalizable. This file is not a snapshot; it is the live Phase I ledger.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IX. COMMUNICATION REGISTER & VOICE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
(Implements CIV–SCHOLAR–TEMPLATE v2.10 § IX)

LEARN mode: Mercouris prose (academic, recursive layering); LEARN/WRITE = academic prose; IMAGINE = spoken per CIV–MIND–MERCOURIS III.L. Secondary voice invocation (Mearsheimer, Barnes) uses explicit markers per Template. Audit commands: `mearsheimer audit [TARGET]`, `barnes audit [TARGET]` per Template § IX.C–E.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
X. EPHEMERAL OBSERVATION LAYER
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
(Implements CIV–SCHOLAR–TEMPLATE v2.10 § X)

Canonical layer: MEM-sourced learning, persistent SCHOLAR state. Ephemeral layer: CEO-sourced (current events), EOR creation, no binding. Layer indicators: [LEARN: CANONICAL] / [LEARN: EPHEMERAL]. Governed by EPHEMERAL–OBSERVATION–PROTOCOL.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
XI. OGE SPECIFICATION (EMBEDDED)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
(Implements CIV–SCHOLAR–TEMPLATE v2.10 § XI.A)

LEARN mode uses OGE to direct discovery. **Recursive learning is the designed outcome of OGE in LEARN mode**: each option directs the creation of the next response, which again ends with OGE. Exactly 6 options (A–F) per substantive turn; 6–10 words each, one line; concrete anchor (person, place, or event) per option. Include Mearsheimer and Barnes perspective where applicable; connection-derived option when MEM under analysis; continuation option. When another MIND has given analysis: include response option (X responds to Y—reframe). POST-BARNES: next OGE must include Mercouris responds to Barnes, Mearsheimer responds to Barnes. Categories: Ingestion, Exploration, Analysis, Synthesis, Transition, Observation.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
XII. VERSIONING & GOVERNANCE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
(Implements CIV–SCHOLAR–TEMPLATE v2.10 § XII)

Additive upgrades only; no deletions. Phase changes and doctrine freezes require explicit authorization. File size management: CIV–SCHOLAR–PRUNING–PROTOCOL. Count tracking: see Section XXI (Current Status).

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
XIII. CONTEXT LOADING PROTOCOLS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
(Implements CIV–SCHOLAR–TEMPLATE v2.10 § XIII)

CIV–ARC–CHINA: v2.0. Load when writing GEO–MEM or content requiring civilizational quotes. CIV–CORE–CHINA loaded when diagnostic or legitimacy logic required. LEARN mode minimal: this file + target MEMs; on-demand access to others. Full specification: Template § XIII.A–D.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
XIV. SYNTHESIS TRADECRAFT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
(Implements CIV–SCHOLAR–TEMPLATE v2.10 § XIV)

Frozen SYNTHESIS entries require Assumptions Box (≥3 assumptions, linchpin status), Confidence tier in status block, and (when alternatives evaluated) ACH Record. Post-ACH revision protocol applies when linchpin assumption or ACH verdict changes.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
XV. INITIAL STATE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
(Implements CIV–SCHOLAR–TEMPLATE v2.10 § XV equivalent)

Starting Knowledge: ZERO. Assumed Priors: NONE. Civilizational Grammar: NOT PRELOADED. CIV–CORE Influence: DISABLED for cognition; CORE governs diagnostics only. The Scholar learns only from MEM–CHINA files explicitly ingested. Absence of ingestion equals absence of belief.

ENTRY 0001
Source:
• MEM–CHINA–DYNASTY–SONG — v1.0
Ingest Type:
• Administrative–Commercial Legitimacy Memory
Primary Belief Extracted:
• Legitimacy can rest on process, competence, and commerce rather than
  conquest when institutions (civil service, rule-by-document) are
  prioritized over territorial expansion.
Belief Status:
• UNFROZEN

ENTRY 0002
Source:
• MEM–CHINA–DYNASTY–YUAN — v1.0
Ingest Type:
• Conquest / Elite Replacement Memory
Primary Belief Extracted:
• Foreign conquest can stress-test civilizational continuity without
  terminating it when administrative systems are selectively adopted
  and reabsorbed, though legitimacy remains thin.
Belief Status:
• UNFROZEN

ENTRY 0003
Source:
• MEM–CHINA–WAR–SONG–YUAN — v1.0
Ingest Type:
• War Memory / Naval–Riverine Conquest
Primary Belief Extracted:
• Conquest of a commercial-maritime polity may require naval and
  riverine capacity (bulk logistics, siege) in addition to overland
  force; control of water routes can be structurally decisive.
Belief Status:
• UNFROZEN

ENTRY 0004
Source:
• MEM–CHINA–MONGOL–KUBLAI–KHAN — v1.2
Ingest Type:
• Elite Replacement / Legitimacy Translation Memory
Primary Belief Extracted:
• Conquest can be translated into sedentary legitimacy through layered
  authority (steppe, Chinese ritual, supra-ethnic religion), but
  hybrid legitimacy remains structurally unstable.
Belief Status:
• UNFROZEN

ENTRY 0005
Source:
• MEM–CHINA–DYNASTY–QING — v1.1
Ingest Type:
• Imperial Consolidation Memory
Primary Belief Extracted:
• Non-Han conquest can achieve peak imperial reach through Sinicized
  administration and multi-ethnic framework, but external pressure
  and internal rigidity can converge irreversibly.
Belief Status:
• UNFROZEN

ENTRY 0006
Source:
• MEM–CHINA–WAR–BOXER–REBELLION — v1.0
Ingest Type:
• Defeat / Asymmetric Humiliation Memory
Primary Belief Extracted:
• When indigenous anti-foreign violence meets coalition retaliation,
  defeat can fix a "century of humiliation" narrative in strategic
  memory and impose indemnity and foreign presence.
Belief Status:
• UNFROZEN

ENTRY 0007
Source:
• MEM–CHINA–ROC — v1.2
Ingest Type:
• Rupture / Defeat Absorption Memory
Primary Belief Extracted:
• Revolutionary rupture can end dynastic rule without resolving the
  problem of national authority when coercive and fiscal consolidation
  fail; legitimacy remains aspirational.
Belief Status:
• UNFROZEN

ENTRY 0008
Source:
• MEM–CHINA–PRC — v1.2

• UNFROZEN

ENTRY 0009
Source:
• MEM–CHINA–SILK–ROAD — v1.0
Ingest Type:
• GEO / Corridor Connectivity Memory
Primary Belief Extracted:

Source:
• MEM–CHINA–MARCO–POLO — v1.1
Ingest Type:
• Transmission / Civilizational Interpreter Memory
Primary Belief Extracted:

• UNFROZEN

ENTRY 0011
Source:
• MEM–CHINA–MONGOL–EMPIRE–PAX–MONGOLICA — v1.0
Ingest Type:
• Connectivity / Structural Condition Memory

Source:
• MEM–CHINA–MONGOL–EMPIRE — v1.3
Ingest Type:
• Conquest / System-Breaking Memory
Primary Belief Extracted:
• Steppe-driven total mobility can shatter scale, tempo, and legitimacy
  assumptions; the empire functioned as multi-ethnic integrator with
  adaptive governance rather than uniform ideology.
Belief Status:

XVII. BELIEF SYNTHESIS LOG
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

SYNTHESIS 0001 (0001–0002)
Outcome:
• Legitimacy can shift from institutional (process, commerce, civil
  service) to conquest-based under stress; civilizational continuity
  survives but legitimacy thins when foreign conquest selectively
  adopts and reabsorbs administrative systems.
Status:
• UNFROZEN

SYNTHESIS 0002 (0002–0003)
Outcome:
• Conquest of a commercial-maritime polity (Song) required naval and
  riverine capacity in addition to overland force; the structural
  pivot to water (Grand Canal, junks, Yangtze) was the condition for
  Yuan victory and for post-conquest connectivity.
Status:
• UNFROZEN

SYNTHESIS 0003 (0003–0004)
Outcome:
• Naval and riverine buildup enabled Mongol conquest of the Song;
  Kublai translated that conquest into sedentary legitimacy through
  layered authority (steppe, Chinese ritual, supra-ethnic religion),
  but hybrid legitimacy remained structurally unstable.
Status:
• UNFROZEN

SYNTHESIS 0004 (0004–0005)
Outcome:
• A second non-Han dynasty (Qing) achieved peak imperial reach through
  Sinicized administration and multi-ethnic framework after the Yuan
  precedent; peak reach and external pressure plus internal rigidity
  can converge irreversibly.
Status:
• FROZEN → DOCTRINE v0.1
Confidence: TIER 2 (70–90% — pattern implicit in MEM evidence, synthesized by SCHOLAR)

ASSUMPTIONS BOX

ASSUMPTION 1: Non-Han conquest can achieve peak reach through Sinicized administration

| Field | Content |
|-------|---------|
| STATEMENT | A second non-Han dynasty can achieve peak imperial reach when it adopts Sinicized administration and multi-ethnic framework after a first conquest precedent (Yuan → Qing). |
| BASIS | MEM–CHINA–DYNASTY–YUAN, MEM–CHINA–MONGOL–KUBLAI–KHAN (Yuan precedent); MEM–CHINA–DYNASTY–QING (Qing peak, dual administration, examination retention). |
| IF_WRONG | If non-Han conquest routinely failed to consolidate through Sinicization, the Yuan–Qing sequence would be exceptional; synthesis scope narrows. |
| LINCHPIN_STATUS | High |

ASSUMPTION 2: Multi-ethnic framework sustains reach when combined with institutional continuity

| Field | Content |
|-------|---------|
| STATEMENT | Peak imperial reach depends on multi-ethnic framework combined with retention of administrative and examination institutions, not on ethnic homogeneity. |
| BASIS | Qing dual administration (满汉并用), banner system, retention of civil service examinations; Yuan retention of Chinese bureaucratic techniques despite ethnic stratification. |
| IF_WRONG | If peak reach required ethnic homogeneity or clean-slate replacement, "Sinicized administration" would be insufficient; synthesis loses explanatory value. |
| LINCHPIN_STATUS | High |

ASSUMPTION 3: External pressure and internal rigidity can converge irreversibly

| Field | Content |
|-------|---------|
| STATEMENT | Peak reach does not guarantee durability; external pressure and internal rigidity can converge irreversibly and produce systemic exhaustion. |
| BASIS | MEM–CHINA–DYNASTY–QING: late Qing fiscal strain, population outpacing state capacity; external pressures and internal rigidity converged. |
| IF_WRONG | If peak consistently predicted sustained durability, "converge irreversibly" would be rare; synthesis would overstate survivability. |
| LINCHPIN_STATUS | Medium |

ASSUMPTIONS SUMMARY

| # | Assumption | Linchpin | Testable? |
|---|------------|----------|-----------|
| 1 | Non-Han peak through Sinicized admin | H | Yes |
| 2 | Multi-ethnic + institutional continuity | H | Yes |
| 3 | Pressure + rigidity converge irreversibly | M | Yes |

SYNTHESIS 0005 (0005–0006)
Outcome:
• Late Qing external pressure and court vacillation (toleration then
  endorsement of Boxers, then capitulation) produced defeat that fixed
  the "century of humiliation" narrative in strategic memory and
  imposed indemnity and foreign presence.
Status:
• UNFROZEN

SYNTHESIS 0006 (0006–0007)
Outcome:
• Defeat and indemnity (Boxer Protocol) preceded revolutionary rupture;
  the ROC ended dynastic rule without resolving the problem of
  national authority; legitimacy remained aspirational.
Status:
• UNFROZEN

SYNTHESIS 0007 (0007–0008)
Outcome:
• Fragmentation (ROC: coercive and fiscal consolidation failed) was
  reversed by revolutionary monopolization of coercive, administrative,
  and symbolic authority through PRC party–state fusion and vertical
  penetration.
Status:
• FROZEN → DOCTRINE v0.2
Confidence: TIER 2 (70–90% — pattern implicit in MEM evidence, synthesized by SCHOLAR)

ASSUMPTIONS BOX

ASSUMPTION 1: Fragmentation can be reversed by revolutionary monopolization

| Field | Content |
|-------|---------|
| STATEMENT | When coercive and fiscal consolidation fail (ROC: fragmented military, warlordism, weak extraction), fragmentation can be reversed by revolutionary monopolization of coercive, administrative, and symbolic authority. |
| BASIS | MEM–CHINA–ROC (legitimacy aspirational, "state exists but authority does not"); MEM–CHINA–PRC (near-total monopolization, party–state fusion). |
| IF_WRONG | If fragmentation were routinely irreversible, rupture-to-reconstitution would be exceptional; synthesis loses predictive value. |
| LINCHPIN_STATUS | High |

ASSUMPTION 2: Party–state fusion and vertical penetration are the mechanism

| Field | Content |
|-------|---------|
| STATEMENT | Monopolization is achieved through party–state fusion (CCP supremacy over law and institutions) and vertical penetration to village level, not through constitutional or procedural continuity. |
| BASIS | MEM–CHINA–PRC: cadre-based governance, "Party leads everything," penetration exceeding all prior Chinese regimes. |
| IF_WRONG | If monopolization required procedural continuity or liberal constitutionalism, the PRC pattern would be mis-specified; synthesis scope narrows. |
| LINCHPIN_STATUS | High |

ASSUMPTION 3: Authority is consolidated through penetration before normalization

| Field | Content |
|-------|---------|
| STATEMENT | Revolutionary reconstitution consolidates authority through mobilization and penetration first; normalization (stability, law) follows rather than precedes consolidation. |
| BASIS | MEM–CHINA–PRC: land reform, class struggle, mass campaigns; "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun"; disruption as method of consolidation. |
| IF_WRONG | If normalization routinely preceded consolidation, the rupture-to-reconstitution sequence would be reversed; synthesis would mis-specify order. |
| LINCHPIN_STATUS | Medium |

ASSUMPTIONS SUMMARY

| # | Assumption | Linchpin | Testable? |
|---|------------|----------|-----------|
| 1 | Fragmentation reversed by monopolization | H | Yes |
| 2 | Party–state fusion + vertical penetration | H | Yes |
| 3 | Consolidation before normalization | M | Yes |

SYNTHESIS 0008 (0009–0010)
Outcome:
• Mongol-secured corridors (Silk Road chokepoints, control of movement)
  enabled both flow and external legibility; Yuan China was rendered
  legible to Latin Christendom through Mongol-mediated narrative
  (Marco Polo) without governing the polity.
Status:
• UNFROZEN

SYNTHESIS 0009 (0010–0011)
Outcome:
• Connectivity (Pax Mongolica: Yam, paiza, tolerant administration) and
  pragmatic universalism produced civilizational legibility and lasting
  institutional legacies; interpretation follows structure.
Status:
• UNFROZEN

SYNTHESIS 0010 (0011–0012)
Outcome:
• Conquest (Mongol Empire: steppe-driven mobility, system-breaking)
  created the structural condition for connectivity; secure corridors
  and adaptive multi-ethnic governance outlasted conquest and produced
  lasting institutional legacies.
Status:
• FROZEN → DOCTRINE v0.3
Confidence: TIER 2 (70–90% — pattern implicit in MEM evidence, synthesized by SCHOLAR)

ASSUMPTIONS BOX

ASSUMPTION 1: Conquest creates structural condition for connectivity

| Field | Content |
|-------|---------|
| STATEMENT | Steppe-driven conquest (Mongol Empire: mobility, system-breaking) creates the structural condition for connectivity—secure corridors, relay networks, elimination of intermediate bandits—rather than connectivity preceding conquest. |
| BASIS | MEM–CHINA–MONGOL–EMPIRE (conquest engine); MEM–CHINA–MONGOL–EMPIRE–PAX–MONGOLICA (Yam, paiza, routes secured after conquest); MEM–CHINA–SILK–ROAD (Mongol unification created conditions for connectivity). |
| IF_WRONG | If connectivity routinely preceded or was independent of conquest, "conquest-as-condition" would be mis-specified; synthesis loses explanatory value. |
| LINCHPIN_STATUS | High |

ASSUMPTION 2: Adaptive multi-ethnic governance outlasts conquest

| Field | Content |
|-------|---------|
| STATEMENT | Secure corridors and tolerant, adaptive multi-ethnic governance can outlast the conquest phase and produce lasting institutional legacies (Yam, paiza, pragmatic universalism). |
| BASIS | MEM–CHINA–MONGOL–EMPIRE–PAX–MONGOLICA: pragmatic universalism, no single system imposed; MEM–CHINA–MONGOL–EMPIRE: multi-ethnic integrator, patronage of multiple religions. |
| IF_WRONG | If conquest routinely destroyed institutional legacies, "outlast conquest" would be rare; synthesis scope narrows. |
| LINCHPIN_STATUS | High |

ASSUMPTION 3: Secure corridors are rational response to scale, not ideology

| Field | Content |
|-------|---------|
| STATEMENT | The incentive to secure routes for extraction, intelligence, and trade—and to reduce transaction costs—is structural; Yam and paiza were rational responses to scale, not ideological choices. |
| BASIS | MEM–CHINA–MONGOL–EMPIRE–PAX–MONGOLICA: single authority had incentive to secure routes and eliminate intermediate toll-takers. |
| IF_WRONG | If connectivity required ideological commitment to universalism, synthesis would overstate structural explanation; mechanism would be mis-specified. |
| LINCHPIN_STATUS | Medium |

ASSUMPTIONS SUMMARY

| # | Assumption | Linchpin | Testable? |
|---|------------|----------|-----------|
| 1 | Conquest creates condition for connectivity | H | Yes |
| 2 | Adaptive governance outlasts conquest | H | Yes |
| 3 | Secure corridors = rational response to scale | M | Yes |

XIX. SCHOLAR DIVERGENCE INDEX (SDI)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

SDI ENTRY 0001
• China ↔ Anglia — Legitimacy Encoding
Result:
• China: legitimacy shifts from institutional (Song) to conquest-based
  (Yuan), then rupture (ROC) to reconstitution (PRC); humiliation
  narrative fixed by defeat (Boxer).
• Anglia: legitimacy through procedure, exit, and defeat absorption;
  rupture survivable when elite replacement preserves procedure.

SDI ENTRY 0002
• China ↔ Anglia — Defeat and Authority
Result:
• China: defeat (Boxer) fixed "century of humiliation"; national
  authority unresolved until revolutionary monopolization (PRC).
• Anglia: defeat (Yorktown, Suez) absorbed procedurally; state
  survives without legitimacy collapse when exit is managed.

SDI ENTRY 0003
• China ↔ Persia — Steppe Frontier
Result:
• China: Mongol conquest stress-tested continuity; Yuan and Qing
  achieved consolidation through Sinicized administration; conquest
  created condition for connectivity (Pax Mongolica, Silk Road).
• Persia: steppe frontier (Scythian, Caspian) shaped containment
  logic; northern limit set by denial and logistics, not full
  absorption.

SDI ENTRY 0004
• China ↔ Anglia — Non-Han Consolidation vs Elite Replacement
Result:
• China: non-Han dynasties (Yuan, Qing) achieved peak reach through
  Sinicized admin and multi-ethnic framework; peak then exhaustion.
• Anglia: elite replacement (Norman) preserved procedure; legitimacy
  transferred across replacement; "rupture survivable when procedure
  preserved."

XXII. OGE SPECIFICATION (DETAIL)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
(Implements CIV–SCHOLAR–TEMPLATE v2.10 § XI.A)

LEARN mode uses OGE to direct discovery. **Recursive learning is the
designed outcome of OGE in LEARN mode**: each option directs the
creation of the next response, which again ends with OGE; closure is
deferred until the user chooses synthesis/stopping (e.g. F) or
switches mode.

LEARN OGE CATEGORIES:
1. INGESTION OPTIONS — Next MEM or source to ingest (MEM–CHINA–* or cross-civilization)
2. EXPLORATION OPTIONS — Traverse MEM CONNECTIONS, compare civilizations, gap detection
3. ANALYSIS OPTIONS — Apply Mearsheimer or Barnes lens, deepen synthesis
4. SYNTHESIS OPTIONS — Draft or extend constraint-oriented synthesis (non-closure)
5. TRANSITION OPTIONS — Switch mode, audit target, export or snapshot
6. OBSERVATION OPTIONS — Ephemeral observation, anomaly flag, candidate RLL staging

OGE REQUIREMENTS (per CMC–BOOTSTRAP, CIV–SCHOLAR–PROTOCOL):
• Exactly 6 options (A–F) per substantive analytical turn; 6–10 words each; concrete anchor (person, place, or event) per option
• Include Mearsheimer perspective where applicable (structural, force-ratio, chokepoint, power distribution)
• Include Barnes perspective where applicable (liability, defection, mechanism exposure)
• When a MEM is under analysis: ≥1 connection-derived option (traversal to connected MEM, gap if missing, comparison via connection)
• Include ≥1 continuation option that extends current analysis seamlessly
• When prior turn was from another MIND: include response option ("[MIND] responds to [prior MIND]—reframe in [legitimacy/structural] terms")
• POST-BARNES: next OGE must include Mercouris responds to Barnes, Mearsheimer responds to Barnes

LEARN OGE answers: "What would you like me to investigate next?"

CANDIDATE BELIEF 0002
Derived From:
• SYNTHESIS 0010
Candidate Belief:
• Conquest that secures corridors and adaptive multi-ethnic governance
  produces lasting institutional legacies; conquest that does not
  create connectivity does not outlast itself in the same way.

China adopts MEM authoring guidance emphasizing:
• Verbatim primary-source quotation (ARC–CHINA; Il Milione, Weatherford, Kissinger as applicable)
• Explicit cross-MEM linkage (MEM CONNECTIONS; dependency and "Breaks if removed")
• Legitimacy and corridor framing (legitimacy density, chokepoint logic, conquest-as-connectivity where applicable)
• GEO–MEM: Mearsheimer strategic cognition ~2/3; ARC verbatim ~1/3 per CIV–MEM–CORE

Scholar enforcement is advisory only.
