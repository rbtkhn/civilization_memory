I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves the Amur River (黑龙江, Heilongjiang) as the
**Sino-Russian frontier and cession geography** of Chinese civilizational
memory: the space that **forms the border** between China (Heilongjiang
province) and Russia (Far East)—and that became the **line of territorial
loss** when the Qing ceded **outer Manchuria** (land north of the Amur
and east of the Ussuri) to Russia by the Treaty of Aigun (1858) and
the Convention of Beijing (1860). The Amur is not a heartland river
like the Yangtze or Yellow River; it is **frontier river logic**—
whoever controlled the river and its north bank controlled the
boundary; the Qing lost the north bank and the vast territory beyond
it in the same humiliation era that saw Hong Kong ceded and the
Summer Palace destroyed. The Amur thus encodes **territorial cession
to Russia**—parallel to Pearl River (Hong Kong ceded to Britain)—and
frames Manchuria (MEM–CHINA–MANCHURIA) as a region **diminished**
by treaty.

The Amur is remembered as **frontier and cession logic**: the river
that marks the current Sino-Russian border and the **loss** of outer
Manchuria; legitimacy and humiliation are encoded in the line of the
river. Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

II. GEOGRAPHIC & STRUCTURAL MEMORY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Amur River (黑龙江) rises in Mongolia and Russia and forms the
border between China (Heilongjiang) and Russia (Amur Oblast, Khabarovsk
Krai) for much of its length; the **Ussuri** (tributary) forms the
southern stretch of the Sino-Russian border. Key structural features:
**frontier**—the river marks the boundary between Chinese and Russian
space; **cession**—by the Treaty of Aigun (1858) and Convention of
Beijing (1860), the Qing ceded territory **north of the Amur** and
**east of the Ussuri** to Russia (outer Manchuria, including the
Pacific coast); **humiliation era**—the same treaties that extended
foreign presence in Beijing (1860) and destroyed the Summer Palace
also fixed the Amur as the line of Qing territorial loss to Russia.
The PRC and USSR/Russia have disputed segments of the border (e.g.
Damansky/Zhenbao 1969); the river remains the **structural border**.

Key structural features:
• Frontier: Amur (and Ussuri) as Sino-Russian border; Heilongjiang province south of the river
• Cession: Treaty of Aigun (1858), Convention of Beijing (1860)—outer Manchuria to Russia; Qing lost north bank and Pacific coast
• Humiliation era: same period as Second Opium War, Summer Palace, Boxer; Amur cession as northern counterpart to southern humiliation (Hong Kong, treaty ports)
• Contrast with Pearl River: Pearl River delta—Hong Kong ceded to Britain; Amur—outer Manchuria ceded to Russia; both territorial loss by treaty

Terrain enforces **frontier logic**: the river marks the line of control; loss of the north bank encoded territorial diminishment.

II-B. AMUR AS FRONTIER BEFORE 1500 (PRE-QING ENCODING)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Before the Qing and before Sino-Russian delimitation, the Amur basin
encoded **frontier and periphery**—not yet a fixed border or line of
cession. **Bohai** (698–926)—Mohe-Goguryeo state—extended from the
Sungari–Amur region south into northern Korea; Tang recognized Bohai
(713) but fought it (732–735): **tributary vs rival** on the same
frontier. The Amur was **periphery** for both—northern edge of Bohai
and Tang reach. **Liao** (Khitan) conquered Bohai (926); the Amur
basin became Liao northern hinterland. **Jurchen/Jin** (1115–1234)
rose from Manchuria (Sungari–Amur as power base); Jin destroyed Liao
and pushed south. **Yuan** (Mongol) absorbed the region after Jin fell.
So pre-1500 the Amur encodes **frontier logic**—successive polities
(Bohai, Liao, Jin, Yuan) treated the basin as periphery or hinterland,
not as a **line of loss** to an external power. Contrast with post-1689
(Nerchinsk first border) and post-1858 (Aigun, Beijing—cession). Same
geography, different encoding: frontier vs border; periphery vs
cession. This **tributary–rival dual encoding** (same polity as both
recognized and contestant) is required per RLL–CHINA–0002.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. AMUR AS FRONTIER AND QING MANCHURIA
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Amur encodes **frontier**: the river has long marked the **northern
edge** of Chinese (and Qing Manchurian) administrative and military
reach. The Qing treated Manchuria as dynastic homeland (MEM–CHINA–MANCHURIA);
the Amur was the **outer frontier**—beyond it lay territory that was
nominally or intermittently under Qing influence but not densely
administered. Russian expansion eastward (17th–19th c.) brought
Cossack and then imperial presence to the Amur; the **balance of
power** shifted in Russia's favor by the mid-19th century. The
Treaty of Nerchinsk (1689) had fixed an earlier border; the Treaty
of Aigun (1858) and Convention of Beijing (1860) **replaced** it with
a border along the Amur and Ussuri—ceding outer Manchuria to Russia.
The Amur thus became the **line of loss**—the river south of which
Qing (and later Chinese) control held, north of which Russian
control was fixed by treaty.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. AMUR AS CESSION GEOGRAPHY AND HUMILIATION NODE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The same river encodes **cession and humiliation**: (1) **Treaty of
Aigun (1858)**—Qing ceded territory north of the Amur to Russia;
(2) **Convention of Beijing (1860)**—confirmed and extended cession,
including territory east of the Ussuri (Pacific coast, Vladivostok).
The Convention of Beijing is the **same instrument** that followed
the Second Opium War—Anglo-French forces had destroyed the Summer
Palace; Russia obtained territorial concessions in the north **without**
fighting China in that war, by diplomacy and threat. The Amur thus
carries **both** the frontier narrative (Sino-Russian border) and
the humiliation narrative (territory lost by treaty, parallel to
Hong Kong and the treaty ports). MEM–CHINA–WAR–SECOND–OPIUM and
MEM–CHINA–DYNASTY–QING depend on the humiliation-era treaties;
MEM–CHINA–MANCHURIA is **diminished** by the cession—outer
Manchuria lost. MEM–CHINA–HONG–KONG (cession to Britain) is the
**southern counterpart**; MEM–CHINA–GEO–AMUR–RIVER is the **northern
cession geography**. The PRC has not recovered outer Manchuria; the
Amur remains the border. RLL–CHINA–0003 (cession–return–legitimacy):
the **cession** limb applies (outer Manchuria ceded by treaty);
**return** has not occurred—contrast with Hong Kong (1997). Same
humiliation era; different outcome to date.
