I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves the **Second Opium War** as the **capital-strike
phase** of the "century of humiliation": the conflict in which
Anglo-French forces advanced to Beijing, imposed the Treaty of
Tianjin (1858) and the Convention of Beijing (1860), and **destroyed
the Summer Palace (圆明园)** in 1860—fixing in Chinese strategic
memory the image of foreign armies in the capital and the
deliberate destruction of an imperial symbol.

The war is remembered not only as a sequel to the First Opium War
(treaty ports, indemnity, extraterritoriality extended), but as
**humiliation at the center**: the capital was penetrated; the
court fled; the Summer Palace was burned. The template of unequal
treaties was deepened; the psychological and symbolic blow to Qing
legitimacy was irreversible.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

II. STRUCTURAL LOGIC: COALITION COERCION & CAPITAL PENETRATION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Structurally, the Second Opium War was the **escalation** of foreign
coercion from coastal treaty ports to the capital. British and
French incentives (expand trade, enforce treaty terms, avenge
diplomatic affronts) converged with Qing inability to resist
combined Anglo-French force. The balance of power favored the
coalition; the Qing could not defend Tianjin or Beijing. The
**incentive** for the coalition was to impose terms at the capital
and punish resistance; the **incentive** for the court was to
preserve the dynasty—accept the Convention, flee when necessary,
return when the coalition withdrew.

The **Arrow incident** (1856) and subsequent disputes provided
the trigger; British and French expeditionary forces advanced;
the Summer Palace was destroyed in retaliation and as symbol of
imperial humiliation.

III. CAMPAIGN & SUMMER PALACE (1860)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Hostilities resumed in 1856; Anglo-French forces took Canton
(1857) and advanced north. The Treaty of Tianjin (1858) extended
treaty ports, legalized opium trade, allowed foreign legations
in Beijing, and imposed indemnity. When the Qing resisted full
implementation, the coalition launched a new campaign (1860),
defeated Qing forces, and advanced to Beijing. The court fled
to Rehe (Chengde). Anglo-French troops entered Beijing and
**destroyed the Summer Palace (圆明园)**—burning and looting
the imperial retreat—as retaliation and symbolic assertion of
coalition power. The Convention of Beijing (1860) confirmed and
extended Tianjin; Kowloon was ceded to Britain; indemnity
increased; legations in Beijing were secured.

Key structural facts:
• Capital penetrated; court fled; Summer Palace destroyed—**humiliation
  at the center**, not only at the coast.
• Treaty ports and unequal treaty framework extended; foreign
  presence in Beijing institutionalized.
• The destruction of the Summer Palace became a **lasting symbol**
  in Chinese memory: foreign armies had violated the capital and
  destroyed an icon of imperial civilization.

IV. SOURCE EVIDENCE — KISSINGER (ARC–CHINA)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Henry Kissinger, *On China* (Penguin Press, 2011) (ARC–CHINA–T–MODERN):

"China is singular. No other country can claim so long a continuous civilization, or such an intimate link to its ancient past and classical principles of strategy and statesmanship."

"The Chinese ideal stressed subtlety, indirection, and the patient accumulation of relative advantage. The Western tradition prized the decisive clash of forces."

— Kissinger on Qing collision with the West; Second Opium War and Summer Palace as deepening of "century of humiliation"; capital as symbol. ARC–CHINA v1.0.

V. LEGITIMACY & STRATEGIC MEMORY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Second Opium War **deepened** the humiliation template: the
capital had been violated; the court had fled; the Summer Palace
had been destroyed. For later Chinese elites (Republican, PRC),
the Convention of Beijing and the destruction of the Summer
Palace became **evidence** of the century of humiliation—a frame
that persists. The war did not cause the fall of the Qing, but
it **fixed** the image of foreign power at the center and
accelerated legitimacy decay. Boxer (1900) would repeat the
pattern: legations besieged, capital occupied, Protocol imposed.

No moral verdict—structural outcome. Coalition imposed terms;
Qing accepted; the capital had been struck.
