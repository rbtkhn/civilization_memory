I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves Jinan (济南) as the **Shandong provincial
capital and interior node** of Chinese civilizational memory:
the space that has long functioned as the administrative center
of Shandong—**never a treaty port** in the first wave (1842) and
never a foreign leasehold like Qingdao (1898). Jinan encodes
**interior continuity**: when the coast was imposed upon (Qingdao
leased to Germany, Tianjin treaty port), Jinan remained under
Chinese administration; it was nonetheless drawn into the
humiliation era—Boxer context (Shandong as missionary and
Boxer heartland) and the **Jinan Incident (May 1928)** (Japanese
clash with Nationalist forces during Northern Expedition).
Under the PRC, Jinan is the provincial capital of Shandong—
reincorporated, no concession.

Jinan is remembered not only as a city, but as the **contrast
to coastal concession**: Shandong capital on the interior;
Qingdao (coastal) was leased; Jinan (interior) was not.
Contrast with Tianjin (treaty port, concessions), Beijing
(capital struck), and Qingdao (leasehold).

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

II. GEOGRAPHIC & STRUCTURAL MEMORY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Jinan sits on the Yellow River (黄河) and the historical
Grand Canal route, in the North China Plain—the **inland**
administrative center of Shandong. It was **not** one of
the five treaty ports (1842) or the later treaty ports
opened by Tianjin or Shimonoseki; it was **not** leased
like Qingdao (1898). Key structural features: **Shandong
capital**—long-term administrative and cultural center;
**Boxer context**—Shandong was the heartland of Boxer
origins and missionary conflict; **Jinan Incident (1928)**—
Japanese forces clashed with Nationalist (KMT) forces
entering Jinan during the Northern Expedition; civilian
and military casualties; encoding **Japanese imposition**
on the interior, not only the coast. **Interior**—contrast
with Qingdao (coastal, leased).

Key structural features:
• Shandong provincial capital: administrative center; Yellow River and Canal node
• No treaty port: never opened by Nanjing, Tianjin, or Shimonoseki; never leased
• Boxer context: Shandong as Boxer and missionary heartland; Jinan in province
• Jinan Incident (May 1928): Japanese–Nationalist clash; Northern Expedition; humiliation at interior node
• PRC: Shandong capital; reincorporated 1949; no concession

III. INTERIOR VS COASTAL NODE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Jinan encodes **interior vs coastal**: Qingdao (same province)
was **leased** to Germany (1898) and occupied by Japan (1914–1922);
Jinan was never a concession. Tianjin (treaty port 1860) had
foreign concessions; Beijing (capital) was struck in 1860 and
1900; Jinan remained under Chinese administration through
the treaty-port and Boxer era. For civilizational memory,
Jinan is evidence that **not all nodes** were humiliation
nodes—the interior provincial capital retained administrative
continuity. The contrast with Qingdao (coastal, leasehold)
and Tianjin (treaty port) is structural: Jinan is interior,
never opened by unequal treaty. The **Jinan Incident (1928)**
encodes a **later** humiliation—Japanese military action
against Nationalist forces in an interior city—distinct
from the treaty-port geography of the coast.

IV. JINAN INCIDENT 1928 & PRC REINCORPORATION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The **Jinan Incident (May 1928)** encoded **Japanese imposition
on the interior**: as Nationalist (KMT) forces advanced north
during the Northern Expedition, Japanese forces stationed in
Shandong (protecting interests after Qingdao return) clashed
with them at Jinan; casualties and occupation followed. Jinan
thus also encodes **Republican-era humiliation**—not only Qing
treaty ports but Japanese military action against Chinese
forces in a provincial capital. Under the PRC, Jinan was
reincorporated (1949); no foreign presence. The city remains
the administrative and cultural center of Shandong—Yellow
River, Grand Canal heritage, provincial capital—without
concession. The contrast with Qingdao (port, former leasehold)
is structural: Jinan is interior capital; Qingdao is coastal
port; same province, different geography of humiliation.
