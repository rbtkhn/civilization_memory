I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves Shenzhen as the **reform-era gateway** of
Chinese civilizational memory: the space designated in 1980
as one of the first **Special Economic Zones (SEZs)** under
Deng Xiaoping's reform and opening—a node where the PRC
deliberately created a zone for foreign investment, export
orientation, and experimentation with market mechanisms
**without** ceding sovereignty. Shenzhen encodes **opening
by choice**: not a treaty port imposed by force, but an
SEZ designed by the party–state to attract capital and
technology while retaining political control.

Shenzhen is remembered not only as a city, but as the
**contrast to the treaty-port era**: then, ports were
opened by foreign imposition (Nanjing, Tianjin, Boxer);
now, Shenzhen was opened by PRC policy. The same coast—
Pearl River delta, near Hong Kong—but different
**author**: foreign imposition vs party–state design.
Humiliation vs reconstitution.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

II. GEOGRAPHIC & STRUCTURAL MEMORY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Shenzhen sits on the Pearl River delta, adjacent to Hong
Kong (then British, now SAR). Before 1980 it was a small
town; the **SEZ designation (1980)** transformed it into
a designated zone for export-oriented industry, foreign
investment, and policy experimentation. It is a **coastal
and border** node: proximity to Hong Kong (capital, logistics,
exit option) made it a natural site for the first SEZs. The
PRC did not cede sovereignty; it **created** a zone under
PRC law where certain rules (tax, foreign ownership, labor)
differed from the rest of the country. Control remained
with the party–state.

Key structural features:
• SEZ (from 1980): one of first four; export and foreign investment
• Coastal gateway: Pearl River delta; adjacency to Hong Kong
• No treaty port: no foreign imposition; PRC-designed opening
• PRC megacity: direct-controlled city; tech and finance hub; contrast with treaty-port Shanghai/Guangzhou

III. OPENING BY CHOICE VS IMPOSITION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Shenzhen encodes **opening by choice**: the PRC chose to
create an SEZ there; no foreign power imposed it by
treaty or war. The contrast with Guangzhou (Canton—
opened by Treaty of Nanjing 1842) and Shanghai (treaty
port 1842) is structural: **then**, ports were opened
by foreign coercion; **now**, Shenzhen was opened by
PRC policy. For PRC narrative, Shenzhen is evidence
of **reconstitution**: the coast can be "opened" again,
but this time under party–state control. The same
geography—southern coast, maritime gateway—but
different **sovereign author**. DOCTRINE v0.2
(rupture-to-reconstitution): fragmentation reversed
by monopolization; Shenzhen as reform-era node
exemplifies controlled opening without concession.

IV. PRC MEGACITY & REFORM NODE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Shenzhen has grown from a small town to one of China's
largest and most dynamic cities—tech, finance, logistics.
It remains under PRC sovereignty; the SEZ was never a
concession. The city thus encodes **reform-era success**:
party–state design, foreign capital and technology
attracted, growth delivered—without the humiliation
narrative of the treaty ports. The contrast with
Shanghai (treaty port past, PRC reincorporation) and
Guangzhou (Canton, treaty port) is that Shenzhen has
**no treaty-port past**: it is purely a reform-era
creation. Guangzhou and Shanghai had to be
reincorporated; Shenzhen was never lost.

• MEM–CHINA–PRC — Dependency: PRC SEZ policy; Deng reform and opening. Breaks if removed: no contemporary framing.
• MEM–CHINA–PRC–DENG–XIAOPING — Dependency: Deng-era SEZ creation; reform and opening. Breaks if removed: no policy framing.
• MEM–CHINA–GUANGZHOU — Dependency: Contrast—Guangzhou treaty port vs Shenzhen SEZ; Pearl River delta pair. Breaks if removed: loss of node contrast.
• MEM–CHINA–SHANGHAI — Dependency: Contrast—Shanghai treaty port past vs Shenzhen no treaty-port past. Breaks if removed: loss of reform-era contrast.
• MEM–CHINA–WAR–FIRST–OPIUM — Dependency: Contrast—Canton/Guangzhou opened by force; Shenzhen opened by policy. Breaks if removed: loss of sovereignty contrast.
• MEM–CHINA–CHENGDU — Dependency: Contrast—Shenzhen coastal SEZ vs Chengdu interior. Breaks if removed: loss of interior/coast contrast.
• MEM–CHINA–DYNASTY–QING — Dependency: Contrast—Qing lost control of coast (treaty ports); PRC designs opening (SEZ). Breaks if removed: no dynasty contrast.
