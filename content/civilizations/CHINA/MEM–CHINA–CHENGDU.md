I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves Chengdu as the **interior basin capital** of
Chinese civilizational memory: the space that has long functioned
as the political and economic center of the Sichuan basin (蜀)—
a fertile, defensible interior **never opened as a treaty port**
and never occupied by a foreign power in the coastal sense.
Chengdu encodes **interior continuity**: when the coast was
imposed upon (Guangzhou, Shanghai, treaty ports), Chengdu
remained under Chinese administration; when Chongqing became
the wartime capital, Chengdu was its hinterland.

Chengdu is remembered not only as a city, but as the **contrast
to coastal humiliation**: no Canton system, no Treaty of
Nanjing, no concession. The interior could hold when the
coast could not.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

II. GEOGRAPHIC & STRUCTURAL MEMORY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Chengdu sits on the Chengdu Plain in the upper Yangtze basin,
with historical importance as the capital of Shu (蜀) and
later as the administrative center of Sichuan. It is an
**interior and agricultural** node: fertile plain, river
irrigation, and overland routes to the rest of China. It
was not on the maritime treaty-port map; its significance
was **domestic**—governance, grain, and migration—rather
than foreign trade imposed by treaty.

Key structural features:
• Sichuan basin capital: long-term administrative and cultural center
• No treaty port: never opened by First or Second Opium War treaties
• Interior continuity: under Chinese administration through late Qing, ROC, PRC
• PRC megacity: provincial capital; economic and transport hub; contrast with coastal SEZs

III. INTERIOR VS COASTAL NODE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Chengdu encodes **interior vs coastal**: Guangzhou (Canton)
was the sole permitted port for much of Qing trade and then
one of five treaty ports; Shanghai became the dominant
treaty port; Chengdu was never on that list. The Sichuan
basin supplied grain and manpower; it was not a site of
foreign legal or military imposition. For Republican and
PRC narrative, Chengdu is evidence that **not all nodes**
were humiliation nodes—the interior retained administrative
continuity. The contrast with Guangzhou (treaty port from
1842) and Shenzhen (SEZ from 1980) is structural: Chengdu
is interior, pre-treaty in character, and PRC-developed
without a colonial or concession past.

IV. PRC MEGACITY & SICHUAN HUB
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Under the PRC, Chengdu has remained the capital of Sichuan
(except when Chongqing was split off as a municipality in
1997) and has grown into a major economic and transport
hub. It is a **domestic** megacity—aviation, rail, tech—
rather than a coastal gateway like Shanghai or Shenzhen.
Chengdu thus encodes **interior development**: party–state
investment and integration without the treaty-port or SEZ
origin story of coastal nodes.

• MEM–CHINA–CHONGQING — Dependency: Sichuan basin pair; Chongqing wartime capital, Chengdu hinterland. Breaks if removed: no regional framing.
• MEM–CHINA–WAR–FIRST–OPIUM — Dependency: Contrast—Canton/Guangzhou opened; Chengdu not. Breaks if removed: loss of treaty-port contrast.
• MEM–CHINA–GUANGZHOU — Dependency: Contrast—Guangzhou treaty port vs Chengdu interior. Breaks if removed: loss of node contrast.
• MEM–CHINA–SHANGHAI — Dependency: Contrast—Shanghai maritime vs Chengdu interior. Breaks if removed: loss of node contrast.
• MEM–CHINA–PRC — Dependency: PRC Sichuan capital; interior development. Breaks if removed: no contemporary framing.
• MEM–CHINA–DYNASTY–QING — Dependency: Qing Sichuan; no treaty port in Chengdu. Breaks if removed: no dynasty framing.
• MEM–CHINA–SHENZHEN — Dependency: Contrast—Shenzhen SEZ coastal vs Chengdu interior. Breaks if removed: loss of reform-era contrast.
