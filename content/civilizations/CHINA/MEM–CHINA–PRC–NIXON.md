I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves the **Nixon visit (1972)** as the encoding event by which
the PRC acquired **legitimacy through recognition by the hegemon**: the United
States, having long refused to recognize the PRC, came to Beijing—and the
regime could present this as **face restored** (面子), not concession.

Nixon represents **external validation of PRC sovereignty**—the decisive
symbol that the revolution could be received as a civilized, negotiable
state. The visit did not create PRC legitimacy; it **encoded** it in
Sino-American and global memory.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. STRATEGIC CONTEXT & MUTUAL INCENTIVE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The opening served both sides' structural interests.

US incentives:
• Exit from Vietnam; need for leverage over North Vietnam and USSR  
• Sino-Soviet split as opportunity to triangulate  
• Nixon/Kissinger preference for great-power diplomacy over ideology  

PRC incentives:
• Break diplomatic isolation; counter Soviet pressure  
• Secure recognition without surrendering core claims (Taiwan, principle)  
• Present regime as legitimate interlocutor—civilized, not pariah  

The balance of power made accommodation rational for both. The visit was
**theatre and substance**: symbolism (the hegemon comes to us) and
institutionalization (Shanghai Communiqué, liaison offices, eventual
normalization).

III. THE VISIT AS ENCODING EVENT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
February 1972: Nixon in Beijing, Hangzhou, Shanghai. Meetings with Mao,
Zhou; handshake; banquets; Shanghai Communiqué.

Key encoding elements:
• **Mao received Nixon** — Revolutionary and capitalist leader face-to-face;
  Mao's authority was the one Nixon came to see.  
• **Zhou as operational counterpart** — Protocol, substance, face-saving
  formulas.  
• **Shanghai Communiqué** — Agreed differences on Taiwan; "one China"
  acknowledged by the US in the form the PRC could claim; no formal
  diplomatic recognition yet, but the track laid.  
• **Global broadcast** — The world saw the PRC as host to the American
  president. Legitimacy through spectacle.  

Face logic:
The hegemon had not "granted" legitimacy; the hegemon had **come**. The
direction of travel (Nixon to Beijing, not Mao to Washington for a first
summit) was itself part of the encoding—the PRC as equal, even as the
weaker party in material terms.

IV. LEGACY FOR PRC MEMORY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
In PRC official memory, the Nixon opening is **proof of strategic wisdom and
civilizational respect**: we were worth the trip; we held our ground; we
did not surrender principle (Taiwan deferred, not abandoned).

Functions:
• **Humiliation narrative counterpoint** — After century of humiliation, the
  strong came to us.  
• **Performance legitimacy** — The regime could deliver recognition.  
• **Continuity with Zhou** — Zhou is remembered as the face that made the
  opening possible; Nixon is the counterpart who came.  
• **Precedent for later opening** — Deng-era normalization built on this track.  

The visit did not resolve structural rivalry; it **encoded** a modality of
engagement—great-power dialogue, face-saving formulas, strategic patience—
that persists.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Legitimacy can be encoded by the hegemon's presence, not only by the
  hegemon's consent.  
• The direction of travel (who visits whom) carries symbolic weight in
  face-based systems.  
• Mutual strategic interest can produce spectacle that both sides use for
  domestic and international legitimacy.  
• The Nixon opening is a hinge: post-Mao opening and performance legitimacy
  rest partly on the memory that the US once came to Beijing.  

Tension preserved without verdict.

Henry Kissinger, *On China* (Penguin Press, 2011) (ARC–CHINA–T–MODERN):

"The Chinese ideal stressed subtlety, indirection, and the patient
accumulation of relative advantage. The Western tradition prized the
decisive clash of forces."

VII. MEM CONNECTIONS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• MEM–CHINA–PRC — Dependency: Nixon visit as encoding event for PRC external legitimacy. Breaks if removed: no 1972 opening baseline.
• MEM–CHINA–PRC–ZHOU–ENLAI — Dependency: Zhou as host and negotiator; Nixon visit as peak of Zhou's diplomatic role. Breaks if removed: no counterpart framing.
• MEM–CHINA–PRC–KISSINGER — Dependency: Kissinger as architect of opening; secret trip 1971 preceded Nixon visit. Breaks if removed: no channel narrative.
• MEM–CHINA–PRC–DENG–XIAOPING — Dependency: Deng-era normalization built on Nixon-era track. Breaks if removed: no pre-reform opening baseline.
• MEM–CHINA–WAR–BOXER–REBELLION — Dependency: Nixon visit as counter to humiliation narrative (strong came to us). Breaks if removed: no encoding contrast.
