I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves Shanghai as the **treaty-port node** of Chinese
civilizational memory: the space opened by the Treaty of Nanjing
(1842) as one of five treaty ports, and the one that emerged as
the dominant commercial and foreign-presence node—concessions,
extraterritoriality, and maritime connectivity—encoding both
**humiliation** (imposed opening, foreign control) and **connectivity**
(commerce, finance, gateway). Under the PRC, Shanghai was
reincorporated but retained symbolic and economic centrality as
a megacity and financial center.

Shanghai is remembered not only as a city, but as the **paradigmatic
treaty port**: the node where foreign imposition and commercial
success converged, and where Republican and PRC narratives of
the "century of humiliation" and of "opening" both attach.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

II. GEOGRAPHIC & STRUCTURAL MEMORY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Shanghai sits at the mouth of the Yangtze River, with access
to the interior (Grand Canal, Yangtze) and to maritime routes.
Its rise as a dominant node followed the **First Opium War**:
opened as a treaty port in 1842, it became the primary hub for
foreign trade, banking, and concessions (British, French,
International Settlement). The **Second Opium War** and later
treaties extended foreign presence; Shanghai did not suffer
direct military destruction in the same way as Beijing (Summer
Palace, Boxer siege), but it encoded **commercial and legal
imposition**: extraterritoriality, concession administration,
foreign control of key infrastructure.

Key structural features:
• Treaty port (from 1842): opened by Nanjing; one of five, then
  dominant
• Concession era: foreign-administered zones; extraterritoriality
• Maritime and riverine node: Yangtze mouth; bulk and trade
• PRC reincorporation (1949): concessions ended; city retained
  economic and symbolic role; reform era (1980s+) renewed
  commercial centrality

III. HUMILIATION & CONNECTIVITY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Shanghai encodes **humiliation** in the treaty-port sense: opened
by force, governed in part by foreign concession authorities,
symbol of unequal treaties. It also encodes **connectivity**:
commerce, finance, and ideas flowed through Shanghai; the city
became the gateway for modernizing elites, revolutionaries, and
capital. The Boxer Rebellion did not center on Shanghai (the
siege was in Beijing); Shanghai was the **contrasting node**—
commercial imposition rather than capital occupation. For
Republican and PRC narrative, Shanghai is both evidence of
humiliation (treaty port, concessions) and evidence of
commercial and cultural centrality.

IV. PRC REINCORPORATION & REFORM
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The PRC ended concessions and extraterritoriality in Shanghai
(1949); the city was reincorporated under party–state control.
Reform and opening (1980s+) renewed Shanghai's role as
financial and commercial center—no longer under foreign
concession, but again a gateway and node. The contrast with
the treaty-port era is structural: then, foreign legal and
administrative presence; now, PRC sovereignty with commercial
openness. Shanghai thus also encodes **reconstitution**: the
node remains central, but control shifted from foreign
concession to party–state.
