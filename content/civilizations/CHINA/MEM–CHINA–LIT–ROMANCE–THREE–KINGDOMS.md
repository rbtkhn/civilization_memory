I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves the **Romance of the Three Kingdoms** (三国演义) not as
history but as **civilizational encoding**—the foundational narrative of
**legitimacy, loyalty, strategy, and betrayal** in Chinese political culture.
Luo Guanzhong's novel (14th c.) refashioned the Three Kingdoms period
(220–280) into a portable grammar: how authority is claimed, how loyalty is
tested, how strategy trumps force, and how legitimacy outlasts or fails
conquest.

The Romance represents **narrative legitimacy**: Liu Bei and Shu Han as
rightful heirs (汉室宗亲); Cao Cao as cunning usurper; Zhuge Liang as
strategic genius and loyal minister; Guan Yu as embodiment of loyalty (义).
The text functions as **portable doctrine**—endlessly reabsorbed by later
regimes, popular culture, and strategic discourse precisely because it
encodes **how Chinese political culture remembers power, virtue, and
treachery**.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. TEXTUAL ORIGIN & CONTEXT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
《三国演义》 emerged in the early Ming, drawing on **Sanguozhi** (Records of
the Three Kingdoms, Chen Shou, 3rd c.) and centuries of oral and dramatic
tradition (评话, 戏曲).

Contextual drivers:
• Han collapse and warlord fragmentation (late 2nd c.)  
• Three Kingdoms period: Wei (Cao Cao), Shu (Liu Bei), Wu (Sun Quan)  
• Luo Guanzhong's synthesis: historical frame + moral and strategic encoding  
• Ming reception: legitimacy, loyalty, and strategy as enduring themes  

Historical premise:
The novel does not invent the period; it **encodes** it. Chen Shou's Sanguozhi
(ARC–CHINA–T–ANCIENT) supplies the skeleton; the Romance supplies the
**grammar of legitimacy and betrayal** that later Chinese audiences recognize.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. LEGITIMACY & RIGHTFUL SUCCESSION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Romance encodes **legitimacy through blood and virtue**, not only through
force.

Key encoding:
• **Liu Bei (刘备)** — Claimed descent from Han imperial house (汉室宗亲);
  virtue and benevolence (仁) as source of legitimacy; Shu Han as rightful
  continuation of Han.  
• **Cao Cao (曹操)** — Cunning, capable, but framed as usurper (奸雄); force
  and strategy without virtue; Wei as illegitimate despite military success.  
• **Sun Quan (孙权)** — Wu as third pole; territorial consolidation; less
  central to the novel's legitimacy drama.  

Canonical formulation (legitimacy through virtue):
> "天下英雄，唯使君与操耳。"
(Of heroes under heaven, only you [Liu Bei] and I [Cao Cao].)
— Cao Cao to Liu Bei; the line encodes the contrast between two types of
claim: virtue vs. power.

Legitimacy in the Romance is **narrative**: the reader is invited to side
with Liu Bei and Shu not because they win, but because they embody the
**rightful** claim. The novel thus encodes **legitimacy as civilizational
memory**—who deserves to rule is decided by narrative, not only by outcome.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. LOYALTY (义) & THE BONDS OF ALLEGIANCE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Romance encodes **loyalty** (义) as the supreme virtue binding minister
to lord and brother to brother.

Key encoding:
• **Guan Yu (关羽)** — Embodiment of loyalty; "Oath of the Peach Garden"
  (桃园结义) with Liu Bei and Zhang Fei; later deified as God of War (关公).  
• **Zhuge Liang (诸葛亮)** — Strategic genius and loyal minister; serves
  Liu Bei and later Liu Shan until death; "bowed to exhaustion" (鞠躬尽瘁).  
• **Betrayal** — Lü Bu (吕布) as negative exemplar (capable but disloyal);
  Wei Yan (魏延) as ambiguous.  

Canonical formulation:
> "鞠躬尽瘁，死而后已。"
(Bow to exhaustion; only after death, rest.)
— Zhuge Liang; loyalty unto death.

The Romance thus encodes **loyalty as civilizational expectation**: the
minister who does not betray is remembered; the one who betrays is
condemned. This grammar persists in Chinese political and popular culture.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. STRATEGY, CUNNING, & VICTORY WITHOUT BATTLE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Romance encodes **strategy** as superior to brute force—aligning with
Sunzi's grammar (MEM–CHINA–LIT–SUNZI).

Key encoding:
• **Zhuge Liang** — Empty Fort Strategy (空城计); borrowing arrows (草船借箭);
  use of fire and terrain; psychological warfare.  
• **Cao Cao** — Cunning and calculation; often outmaneuvered by Zhuge
  Liang but formidable.  
• **Alliances and betrayal** — Alliances shift; trust is scarce; information
  and deception determine outcomes.  

Strategic premise:
Victory goes to the side that **outthinks** the enemy—deception, timing,
alliances, and morale—not only to the side with more soldiers. The Romance
thus reinforces **Sunzi-style strategic culture**: calculation, indirection,
and psychological dominance.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. CIVILIZATIONAL ABSORPTION & ENDURANCE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Romance survived because it encoded **portable lessons**—legitimacy,
loyalty, strategy—without tying them to a single regime or technology.

Patterns of endurance:
• Operas, oral storytelling, film, television, games—endless adaptation.  
• Political discourse: leaders and analysts invoke Zhuge Liang, Cao Cao,
  Guan Yu as types.  
• Strategic discourse: "Three Kingdoms" as shorthand for multipolar
  competition and alliance logic.  
• Legitimacy discourse: "rightful heir" vs. "usurper" as enduring frame.  

Absorption patterns:
• Ming–Qing: legitimacy and loyalty as imperial ideology.  
• Republican and PRC: revolutionary reuse (e.g. Mao's interest in the novel);
  popular culture and strategic analogy.  
• Contemporary: games, TV, business and political metaphor.  

The text endures because **what it encodes—legitimacy, loyalty, strategy,
betrayal—remains the grammar of Chinese political imagination**.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Legitimacy in Chinese political culture is often narrative: who deserves
  to rule is encoded in stories, not only in outcomes.  
• Loyalty (义) is the supreme bond; betrayal is the supreme sin—the Romance
  codifies this.  
• Strategy trumps force; Zhuge Liang and Sunzi share the same civilizational
  grammar.  
• The Romance encodes the Three Kingdoms period as **portable**: later
  audiences read multipolar competition, alliance, and legitimacy through
  it.  
• Contradictions (Liu Bei's virtue vs. Cao Cao's effectiveness) are preserved;
  the novel does not resolve them.

Tension preserved without verdict.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VIII. SOURCE EVIDENCE — ARC (CHEN SHOU, HISTORICAL BASELINE)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Romance rests on **Sanguozhi** (Records of the Three Kingdoms) by Chen
Shou (233–297 CE)—ARC–CHINA–T–ANCIENT. The historical record supplies
events and figures; Luo Guanzhong supplies **encoding**: legitimacy (Liu Bei
as rightful), loyalty (Guan Yu, Zhuge Liang), strategy (Zhuge Liang),
usurpation (Cao Cao). The Romance is thus **civilizational refashioning** of
ancient testimony—not history, but **how Chinese civilization remembers**
the period.

IX. MEM CONNECTIONS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• MEM–CHINA–LIT–SUNZI — Dependency: Romance encodes strategy (Zhuge Liang) consistent with Sunzi's grammar; deception, timing, victory without battle. Breaks if removed: no strategic-culture framing.
• MEM–CHINA–LIT–KONGZI — Dependency: Romance encodes legitimacy through virtue (Liu Bei) and ritualized loyalty; Kongzi's governance-through-virtue as parallel. Breaks if removed: no legitimacy-virtue framing.
• MEM–CHINA–DYNASTY–HAN — Dependency: Han collapse leads to Three Kingdoms; Liu Bei's claim as Han restoration. Breaks if removed: no period baseline.
• CIV–ARC–CHINA — Dependency: Chen Shou (Sanguozhi) is ARC–CHINA–T–ANCIENT; Romance refashions his record. Breaks if removed: no historical-source framing.
