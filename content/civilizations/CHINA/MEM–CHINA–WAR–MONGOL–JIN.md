I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves the **Mongol conquest of the Jin (Jurchen)** as
the **steppe-reversion campaign** within Chinese civilizational
memory: the war that destroyed the Jurchen dynasty and northern
Chinese political order—and in which Genghis Khan deliberately
**reverted conquered land to pasture**, refusing sedentary
administration and Chinese legitimacy.

The war is remembered not as a dynastic replacement, but as **exposure**:
Mongol tempo and mobility collapsed Jin defenses; Mongol policy
(trample farmland, expel peasants, create buffer) revealed the
limits of sedentary frontier management.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. STRUCTURAL LOGIC: TEMPO & FRONTIER COLLAPSE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Structurally, the Jin could not match Mongol tempo. Genghis’s
army traveled light, moved faster than bureaucratic response,
and concentrated force before fixed defenses could adapt. North
Chinese states failed **structurally**, not tactically—the
balance of power favored the side that could set the terms of
conflict. Genghis did not seek to govern the conquered territory
as a Chinese dynasty; he **reverted** it to grazing land and
buffer zone, ensuring the Mongols could return and that peasants
would not reoccupy.

Weatherford documents the reversion:

> "As the Mongol warriors withdrew from the cities of the Jurched, they had one final punishment to inflict upon the land where they had already driven out the people and burned their villages. Genghis Khan wanted to leave a large open land with ample pastures should his army need to return. The plowed fields, stone walls, and deep ditches had slowed the Mongol horses and hindered their ability to move across the landscape in any direction they wished. … When the Mongols left from their Jurched campaign, they churned up the land behind them by having their horses trample the farmland with their hooves and prepare it to return to open pasture. They wanted to ensure that the peasants never returned to their villages and fields. In this way, Inner Mongolia remained a grazing land, and the Mongols created a large buffer zone of pastures and forests between the tribal lands and the fields of the sedentary farmers."
> — Jack Weatherford, *Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World* (Crown, 2004) (ARC–CHINA–T–MODERN).

Governance by **absence**: no Chinese-style administration, only
reversion to pasture and buffer.

III. STEPPE VS SEDENTARY: ENCODING THE OTHER
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The campaign also encoded the **civilizational contrast** between
steppe and sedentary: Mongols saw Jurched (Jin) territory as
incomprehensible—too many people, too few animals—and classified
peasants with the same terminology used for herds. Weatherford:

> "For the Mongols, the lifestyle of the peasant seemed incomprehensible. The Jurched territory was filled with so many people and yet so few animals; this was a stark contrast to Mongolia, where there were normally five to ten animals for each human. To the Mongols, the farmers' fields were just grasslands, as were the gardens, and the peasants were like grazing animals rather than real humans who ate meat. The Mongols referred to these grass-eating people with the same terminology that they used for cows and goats. The masses of peasants were just so many herds, and when the soldiers went out to round up their people or to drive them away, they did so with the same terminology, precision, and emotion used in rounding up yaks."
> — Jack Weatherford, *Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World* (Crown, 2004) (ARC–CHINA–T–MODERN).

The war thus preserves the **steppe/sedentary encoding**—not
assimilation, but exposure and reversion.

Jack Weatherford, *Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World* (Crown, 2004) (ARC–CHINA–T–MODERN):

"As the Mongol warriors withdrew from the cities of the Jurched, they had one final punishment to inflict upon the land where they had already driven out the people and burned their villages. Genghis Khan wanted to leave a large open land with ample pastures should his army need to return. The plowed fields, stone walls, and deep ditches had slowed the Mongol horses and hindered their ability to move across the landscape in any direction they wished. … When the Mongols left from their Jurched campaign, they churned up the land behind them by having their horses trample the farmland with their hooves and prepare it to return to open pasture.

"For the Mongols, the lifestyle of the peasant seemed incomprehensible.

V. OUTCOME & LEGACY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Jin fell in 1234. Mongol policy in the north was **reversion**, not
dynastic replacement—successors (Ögödei, later Kublai) would later
introduce bureaucratic and fiscal experiments, but Genghis did not.
The war encodes the lesson: **shock without assimilation** can collapse
sedentary systems but does not, by itself, build Chinese-style
governance. The Mongol–Chinese synthesis is successor-driven, not
his.

No moral verdict—structural outcome. The Jin fell because they
could not match Mongol tempo; the land was reverted because Genghis
had no incentive to govern it as a Chinese dynasty.

VII. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Jin could not match Mongol tempo; northern states failed structurally.
• Genghis reverted conquered land to pasture; governance by absence.
• Trample farmland, expel peasants, create buffer—no Chinese legitimacy sought.
• Steppe/sedentary encoding: grass-eating people, herds, yaks; exposure, not assimilation.

Tension preserved without verdict.
