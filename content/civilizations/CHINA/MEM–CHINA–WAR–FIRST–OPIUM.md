I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves the **First Opium War** as the **structural opener**
of the "century of humiliation": the conflict in which British naval
and commercial pressure forced the Qing to accept the Treaty of
Nanjing (1842)—cession of Hong Kong, treaty ports, indemnity, and
extraterritoriality—establishing the template for unequal treaties
and foreign imposition that would define late Qing strategic memory.

The war is remembered not as a single-cause event (opium or trade),
but as **asymmetric coercion**: maritime power and industrial
capacity enabled the British to project force and impose terms;
the Qing could not defend the coast or resist the settlement.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. STRUCTURAL LOGIC: MARITIME COERCION & IMPOSITION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Structurally, the First Opium War was the **convergence** of British
incentives (secure trade, open ports, diplomatic parity) and Qing
inability to resist naval power. The balance of power favored the
side that could project force along the coast and up the Yangtze;
British steam and gunboats could; Qing coastal defenses could not.
The **incentive** for Britain was to secure a treaty that guaranteed
access and fixed terms; the **incentive** for the court was to end
hostilities and preserve nominal sovereignty—accept the Treaty,
preserve the dynasty.

No single actor "chose" the war in isolation; structural pressures—
trade imbalance, opium flows, Lin Zexu's seizure and destruction
at Canton (1839), British retaliation—produced the conflict;
British capability produced the outcome.

The outcome also reflects **path dependence**: Ming had ended
state-sponsored maritime projection (罢舟师，守内治); Qing
prioritised continental order and northern frontiers. No sustained
maritime constituency or naval institution had been built; when
a sea-system power (Britain) demanded terms, the dynasty had
no maritime lock-in to fall back on—continental lock-in met
maritime lock-in at Nanjing.

III. CAMPAIGN & SETTLEMENT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Lin Zexu (林则徐) was sent to Canton to suppress the opium trade;
in 1839 he confiscated and destroyed British opium and demanded
pledges from foreign merchants. Britain responded with a naval
expedition; operations extended along the coast and up the Yangtze.
British forces took key positions and threatened Nanjing; the Qing
capitulated. The **Treaty of Nanjing** (1842) established: cession
of Hong Kong to Britain; opening of five treaty ports (Canton,
Xiamen, Fuzhou, Ningbo, Shanghai); indemnity; abolition of the
Canton monopoly; extraterritoriality for British subjects.

Key structural facts:
• British naval and industrial superiority enabled coastal projection;
  Qing could not defend the Yangtze or the coast.
• Treaty ports became nodes of foreign presence and commercial
  penetration; Shanghai would emerge as the dominant node.
• The Treaty established the **unequal treaty** template: indemnity,
  cession, extraterritoriality, imposed terms—repeated in later
  treaties (Second Opium War, Boxer Protocol).

IV. SOURCE EVIDENCE — KISSINGER (ARC–CHINA)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Henry Kissinger, *On China* (Penguin Press, 2011) (ARC–CHINA–T–MODERN):

"China is singular. No other country can claim so long a continuous civilization, or such an intimate link to its ancient past and classical principles of strategy and statesmanship."

"The Chinese ideal stressed subtlety, indirection, and the patient accumulation of relative advantage. The Western tradition prized the decisive clash of forces."

— Kissinger on Qing collision with the West; Opium Wars and unequal treaties as opening phase of "century of humiliation" that shapes Chinese strategic memory. ARC–CHINA v1.0.

IV.B. SOURCE EVIDENCE — KEEGAN (CIVILIZATION-CONTRAST)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

John Keegan, *A History of Warfare* (Alfred A. Knopf, 1993) (ARC–CHINA–T–MODERN):

"Our institutions and our laws, we tell ourselves, have set the human potentiality for violence about with such restraints that violence in everyday life will be punished as criminal by our laws, while its use by our institutions of state will take the particular form of 'civilised warfare.'"

"Clausewitz is the most important writer on war... but his vision was formed by a particular historical moment. He knew nothing of primitive war, little of oriental war, and his theory rests on assumptions about the rationality of politics that history often contradicts."

— Keegan on institutional restraint and "civilised warfare": the First Opium War was a **collision of war-making cultures**. British warfare was institutional, naval, industrial—state violence in Keegan's "civilised warfare" form. Qing warfare and diplomacy were shaped by tribute system and different assumptions about parity. Clausewitz "little of oriental war" applies directly: the Qing did not fight or negotiate within the European rational-politics frame. The Treaty of Nanjing was imposed because one side could project force and shared norms of restraint were absent. Encoding divergence: MEM encodes humiliation template; Keegan supplies Anglo-American military historiography lens.

V. LEGITIMACY & STRATEGIC MEMORY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The First Opium War **encoded** the humiliation template: China had
been unable to resist foreign imposition; the court had accepted
terms that compromised sovereignty. For later Chinese elites
(Republican, PRC), the Treaty of Nanjing and the treaty ports
became **evidence** of the century of humiliation—a frame that
persists in official and popular memory. The war did not cause
the fall of the Qing, but it **opened** the structural sequence:
unequal treaties → treaty ports → Second Opium War → Boxer →
collapse.

No moral verdict—structural outcome. British imposed terms;
Qing accepted; the template was set.
