I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves the **First Opium War** as the **structural opener**
of the "century of humiliation": the conflict in which British naval
and commercial pressure forced the Qing to accept the Treaty of
Nanjing (1842)—cession of Hong Kong, treaty ports, indemnity, and
extraterritoriality—establishing the template for unequal treaties
and foreign imposition that would define late Qing strategic memory.

The war is remembered not as a single-cause event (opium or trade),
but as **asymmetric coercion**: maritime power and industrial
capacity enabled the British to project force and impose terms;
the Qing could not defend the coast or resist the settlement.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. STRUCTURAL LOGIC: MARITIME COERCION & IMPOSITION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Structurally, the First Opium War was the **convergence** of British
incentives (secure trade, open ports, diplomatic parity) and Qing
inability to resist naval power. The balance of power favored the
side that could project force along the coast and up the Yangtze;
British steam and gunboats could; Qing coastal defenses could not.
The **incentive** for Britain was to secure a treaty that guaranteed
access and fixed terms; the **incentive** for the court was to end
hostilities and preserve nominal sovereignty—accept the Treaty,
preserve the dynasty.

No single actor "chose" the war in isolation; structural pressures—
trade imbalance, opium flows, Lin Zexu's seizure and destruction
at Canton (1839), British retaliation—produced the conflict;
British capability produced the outcome.

III. CAMPAIGN & SETTLEMENT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Lin Zexu (林则徐) was sent to Canton to suppress the opium trade;
in 1839 he confiscated and destroyed British opium and demanded
pledges from foreign merchants. Britain responded with a naval
expedition; operations extended along the coast and up the Yangtze.
British forces took key positions and threatened Nanjing; the Qing
capitulated. The **Treaty of Nanjing** (1842) established: cession
of Hong Kong to Britain; opening of five treaty ports (Canton,
Xiamen, Fuzhou, Ningbo, Shanghai); indemnity; abolition of the
Canton monopoly; extraterritoriality for British subjects.

Key structural facts:
• British naval and industrial superiority enabled coastal projection;
  Qing could not defend the Yangtze or the coast.
• Treaty ports became nodes of foreign presence and commercial
  penetration; Shanghai would emerge as the dominant node.
• The Treaty established the **unequal treaty** template: indemnity,
  cession, extraterritoriality, imposed terms—repeated in later
  treaties (Second Opium War, Boxer Protocol).

IV. SOURCE EVIDENCE — KISSINGER (ARC–CHINA)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Henry Kissinger, *On China* (Penguin Press, 2011) (ARC–CHINA–T–MODERN):

"China is singular. No other country can claim so long a continuous civilization, or such an intimate link to its ancient past and classical principles of strategy and statesmanship."

"The Chinese ideal stressed subtlety, indirection, and the patient accumulation of relative advantage. The Western tradition prized the decisive clash of forces."

— Kissinger on Qing collision with the West; Opium Wars and unequal treaties as opening phase of "century of humiliation" that shapes Chinese strategic memory. ARC–CHINA v1.0.

V. LEGITIMACY & STRATEGIC MEMORY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The First Opium War **encoded** the humiliation template: China had
been unable to resist foreign imposition; the court had accepted
terms that compromised sovereignty. For later Chinese elites
(Republican, PRC), the Treaty of Nanjing and the treaty ports
became **evidence** of the century of humiliation—a frame that
persists in official and popular memory. The war did not cause
the fall of the Qing, but it **opened** the structural sequence:
unequal treaties → treaty ports → Second Opium War → Boxer →
collapse.

No moral verdict—structural outcome. British imposed terms;
Qing accepted; the template was set.
