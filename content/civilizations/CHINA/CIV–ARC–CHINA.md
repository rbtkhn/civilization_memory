Only listed authors may be quoted without ARC–DISCOVERY flag.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. DISCOVERY FRAMEWORK
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
When a MEM requires sources beyond the list above:

DISCOVERY FLAG (REQUIRED):
"ARC–DISCOVERY: EXPANDED SEARCH
Source: [Author/Work]
Justification: [Why this source is necessary]"

Expanded discovery does not add authors to this canon without an ARC version upgrade.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V-A. CROSS-ARC CITATION FOR TSP MEMs
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Per CIV–ARC–TEMPLATE v3.0 § V-A. China TSP MEMs may cite sources from other ARCs with explicit ARC declaration.

Format: [Author], [Work] (ARC–[CIV]-T-[PERIOD]) [ERC-ROLE]

Examples:
• MEM–CHINA–MONGOL–EMPIRE (TSP:NETWORK) may cite ARC–PERSIA, ARC–RUSSIA for Mongol transmission.
• MEM–CHINA–SILK–ROAD may cite ARC–PERSIA, ARC–ROME for trade network sources.
• MEM–CHINA–MARCO–POLO may cite ARC–ROME, ARC–ISLAM for medieval travel accounts.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. ORTHOGONALITY WITH ERC
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
ARC-T (temporal) and ERC (evidence role) are ORTHOGONAL. A quotation has BOTH.
See NAMESPACE–CLARIFICATION v1.0.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. WHAT ARC DOES NOT GOVERN
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Governed by CIV–MEM–TEMPLATE v3.0, NOT by ARC: 20% verbatim quote minimum;
EQS; analytical content floor; quote word counting; ERC classification.
ARC determines WHO may be quoted. MEM–TEMPLATE determines HOW MUCH and HOW WELL.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
