This file learns from the present — analysing current events through
historically-grounded patterns to provide structured decision-relevant
options. It is informed by CIV–SCHOLAR–CHINA (which learns from the
past) and by CIV–CORE–CHINA and CIV–DOCTRINE–CHINA. Information does
not feed back into Scholar except via explicit harvest.

Duty of Competence: This file is subject to a completeness standard.
The system's obligation is to surface all material options identifiable
through the application of three analytical perspectives: legitimacy
and institutional continuity; power distribution and structural
constraint; and leadership liability and mechanism. Failure to apply
any perspective constitutes a completeness violation. When the decision
involves a commitment (alliance, arms, presence, confrontation), the
Decision Points option set (X-B step 8) MUST include at least one
option at the accommodation/reversal end of the spectrum.

State learns from Scholar: The historically-grounded patterns and
constraint grammar accumulated in CIV–SCHOLAR–CHINA inform this file.
Doctrinal authority: CIV–DOCTRINE–CHINA (derived from CIV–SCHOLAR–
CHINA). Information flows from STATE into Scholar only via explicit
**harvest** or **harvest session** command (CIV–STATE–TEMPLATE §XIV-B).
The system equips; the principal decides. Accountability lives with
the choice, not the analysis.

Exclusion (Doctrine 02): Any option framed as "legitimacy through
constitutional or procedural reform" or "regime-form change" is
**excluded** by CIV–DOCTRINE–CHINA 02 (Rupture-to-Reconstitution).
Option D (Negotiated Accommodation) is de-escalation and face-saving
within party–state frame, not regime-form change.

I. ENTITY IDENTIFICATION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Name: China / People's Republic of China (PRC) / 中华人民共和国
Classification: CIVILIZATION-STATE
Active: YES
Capital: Beijing
Date of establishment (current state form): 1949
Current State Form: People's Republic (1949–present)

China is a civilization-state claiming continuous civilizational
identity. Legitimacy derives from performance (order, material
provisioning, stability), mandate-of-heaven logic, and party–state
fusion. The entity is framed here as **continuity civilization with
principal external commitment space in the Taiwan Strait and
reunification narrative**; internal stability, exit-building, and
compute sovereignty are parallel decision domains.

Phase history (operational, from CIV–CORE–CHINA):
1. Republican fragmentation (1912–1949)
2. Maoist mobilisation and consolidation (1949–1976)
3. Reform and opening (1978–2012)
4. Xi era — technocratic legitimacy, spatial and compute sovereignty (2012–present)

Persistent patterns drawn from CORE and MEM corpus:
• Mandate stability and narrative control as legitimacy variables (MSI, PLS, SOC, EAL)
• Party–state fusion and vertical penetration; consolidation before normalisation (Doctrine 02)
• Maritime and corridor sensitivity; first-island-chain and near-seas (Spatial Integrity)
• Exit-building and axis optionality under containment (EPV, Axis Optionality)
• Strategic Red Lines: territorial fragmentation, mandate fracture, compute dependency, maritime encirclement

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. SUCCESSION AND INHERITANCE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

INTERNAL SUCCESSION (Continuous Civilizational Layers):

Type: DIRECT_CONTINUATION across regime and dynasty changes.
China stacks historical layers; it does not exit them (CIV–CORE–CHINA III).
Inherited: Mandate-of-heaven legitimacy logic, centralised absorption
doctrine, harmony-over-freedom axiom, civilisation-as-administration
principle. Rupture-to-reconstitution (Doctrine 02) describes
reversal of fragmentation via party–state fusion, not constitutional
continuity.

PRC (1949):
  Date: 1949
  Type: Regime succession within civilizational continuity
  The **PRC** is the current state form. Revolutionary monopolisation
  (party–state fusion, vertical penetration) reversed Republican
  fragmentation. No external institutional transfer; civilizational
  grammar persists across regime change.

Contested claims:
• Taiwan: Sovereignty claimed by PRC; effective control and
  identity contested by ROC and significant share of island population.
  Reunification is a core legitimacy theme; accommodation or reversal
  of commitment is a material option (per duty of competence).
• Maritime and territorial: SCS, ECS, and border disputes with
  neighbours; Spatial Integrity and Escalation Stability are binding
  for options involving maritime consolidation.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. STRATEGIC POSITION (THREE PERSPECTIVES)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

The following three paragraphs elaborate China's strategic position
with respect to its principal external commitment space (Taiwan Strait
and reunification). The same structure applies to other domains
(internal stability, exit-building, compute sovereignty).

A) LEGITIMACY AND INSTITUTIONAL CONTINUITY
────────────────────────────────────────────

China's position on Taiwan is framed through the claim of territorial
and civilizational continuity: the island is encoded as part of the
realm whose unity was broken by foreign imposition and must be
restored. Mandate stability and narrative control depend on the
ability to sustain that encoding without fracture—both at home
(where "reunification" is a core legitimacy theme) and in the way the
claim is presented abroad. Institutional continuity is at stake in the
sense that the party–state's authority to speak for "one China" and
to manage the narrative of humiliation and restoration is part of its
legitimating grammar. If narrative control were to fragment—for
example, if the claim were publicly downgraded or abandoned by a
rival centre of authority—the legitimacy cost would be structural, not
merely tactical. The tension is that what one side treats as restoration
of continuity, the other encodes as absorption or conquest; that
divergence is not resolved by the analysis, only made visible.

B) POWER DISTRIBUTION AND STRUCTURAL CONSTRAINT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────

The Taiwan Strait is a maritime chokepoint where relative military
capacity, geography, and alliance commitments set the feasible set of
outcomes. China's incentive is to deny external military support for
permanent separation and to make the cost of defending the status quo
rise over time; the United States and regional allies have an
incentive to preserve credible deterrence and to keep the balance
such that unilateral change by force is costly. Force ratios, basing,
and the ability to sustain operations across the strait (and to
control escalation) are the structural variables. Geography favours
the side that can project and sustain force across the water and hold
key nodes; historical precedent suggests that loss of the decisive
corridor or node can remove the linchpin for the defender. The
structural constraint on China is that escalation can tip into a
domain where the United States or a coalition has superior reach or
staying power; the structural constraint on the United States is that
extended deterrence depends on credibility and on the defender's
willingness to bear cost. Neither side can fully control the other's
choices; the outcome depends on relative degradation of capability and
resolve over time.

C) LEADERSHIP LIABILITY AND MECHANISM
────────────────────────────────────────────

Who is exposed if the current policy fails—or if it succeeds at high
cost—shapes how much risk leaders can take. On the mainland side, the
commitment to "reunification" is publicly entrenched; reversal or
open-ended accommodation that is read as abandonment would create
defection incentives within the elite and could be framed as a loss of
mandate. On the Taiwan side, the exposure runs the other way: moves
that look like acquiescence to absorption can be punished domestically,
while moves that look like permanent separation can trigger a response
that the island may not be able to withstand. Jurisdiction is
contested—who has the right to decide the island's status—and that
contest is not merely legal but political: whoever is seen to "give
away" the claim or the territory bears the liability. Irreversibility
cuts both ways: a military outcome (whether conquest or failed assault)
creates facts that cannot be undone; a diplomatic outcome that is read
as surrender on either side may also be hard to reverse in domestic
politics. The mechanism question is who can credibly commit to what,
and who pays the price if the commitment is tested or abandoned.

TENSIONS BETWEEN PERSPECTIVES (preserved, not resolved):

1. Legitimacy vs Power: The legitimacy perspective emphasises
   encoding, narrative control, and mandate stability. The power
   perspective emphasises force ratios, geography, and relative
   degradation. These can pull in opposite directions—e.g. escalation
   that strengthens structural position may damage narrative and
   legitimacy; restraint that preserves narrative may allow opponents
   to consolidate.

2. Power vs Liability: The power perspective treats the state as the
   unit of analysis. The liability perspective asks who bears exposure
   for failure or reversal. Leaders may choose options that reduce
   personal or institutional liability at the cost of structural
   optimality (e.g. accommodation that reduces exposure but narrows
   future options).

3. Legitimacy vs Liability: Institutional continuity favours narrative
   and mandate that outlast any single leader. Liability focuses on
   who is exposed in the short term. Tension appears when entrenched
   commitments (e.g. reunification) create exposure for current
   officeholders if they reverse or accommodate.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. MATERIAL OPTIONS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

OPTION A: Continuity Dominance — Performance Legitimacy and Administrative Throughput

  Grounded in: Legitimacy and institutional continuity; power
  distribution (structural capacity)

  Reasoning: China sustains mandate through performance (order,
  material provisioning, stability), party–state fusion, and vertical
  penetration. As long as MSI is not FRACTURED, SOC and EAL hold, and
  AT remains sufficient, the path of "continue current trajectory with
  incremental reform within party–state frame" is viable. Doctrine 02
  implies consolidation is already achieved; normalisation (stability,
  law, technocratic legitimacy) is the current phase.

  Key Assumptions:
  • MSI remains STABLE or STRAINING (not FRACTURED) — Linchpin: YES
  • SOC and EAL do not both degrade sharply (mandate fracture
    acceleration) — Linchpin: YES
  • AT and LCF remain sufficient for central policy to scale (HIGH or
    MED AT; LOW or MED LCF) — Linchpin: YES
  • Internal Stability remains HIGH or MED — Linchpin: NO
  • EAC supports employment absorption so that PLS does not collapse
    — Linchpin: NO

  Confidence: MODERATE
  Assessed against CORE–CHINA legitimacy and governance outputs (MSI,
  PLS, SOC, EAL, AT, LCF, Internal Stability) and precedents from
  MEM–CHINA–PRC (reconstitution), MEM–CHINA–DYNASTY–SONG (institutional
  legitimacy), MEM–CHINA–DYNASTY–QING (peak then exhaustion). Binding
  constraint: Mandate Stability Index (MSI) — if MSI moves to
  FRACTURED, legitimacy accounting fails and continuity-dominant path
  collapses.

  Risks: If PLS declines while SOC stays high, coercive legitimacy
  substitution may set in. If EAL fractures, party–state cohesion
  fails. If external pressure and internal rigidity converge
  (Doctrine 01), exhaustion phase begins.

  Conditions for success: Performance delivery continues; elite
  alignment holds; administrative throughput sustains vertical
  penetration; no major defection or legitimacy rupture.

  Conditions for failure: MSI = FRACTURED; or SOC and PLS decline
  together; or EAL = FRACTURED; or SAF-CH = FAILED.

  Discriminating evidence:
  • Watch for: MSI and EAL movement over 30–90 days; major elite
    defection or public legitimacy crisis; LCF spikes (local defiance
    or policy blockage)
  • Signal of failure: Open legitimacy rupture; institutional or
    elite defection that cannot be contained

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

OPTION B: Exit-Building and Axis Diversification

  Grounded in: Power distribution (structural optionality);
  legitimacy (narrative and partnership as resources)

  Reasoning: China builds parallel systems (finance, logistics,
  compute) and widens axis optionality (Russia, Persia, Global South)
  to reduce dependency on Anglia/US and to insulate against
  containment or sanctions. CORE XII (Exit–Building Meta-Doctrine) and
  XIII (Cross–Civilizational Synchronization) support this path.
  Viability depends on EPV progress and Axis Optionality not narrowing.

  Key Assumptions:
  • Axis Optionality remains WIDENING or STABLE (not NARROWING)
    — Linchpin: YES
  • EPV (Finance / Logistics / Compute / ALL) shows progress on at
    least one vector — Linchpin: YES
  • Partner states (e.g. Russia, Persia) remain willing and able to
    sustain depth partnership or sanctions-exit role — Linchpin: YES
  • Compute Sovereignty does not move to FRAGILE — Linchpin: NO

  Confidence: MODERATE
  Assessed against CORE–CHINA EPV, Axis Optionality, Compute
  Sovereignty and precedents MEM–CHINA–SILK–ROAD (corridor
  connectivity), MEM–CHINA–MONGOL–EMPIRE–PAX–MONGOLICA (pragmatic
  universalism), MEM–CHINA–PRC–KISSINGER (strategic opening). Binding
  constraint: Axis Optionality — if Axis Optionality moves to
  NARROWING, partners defect or are closed off and exit-building loses
  structural support.

  Risks: Partners may defect or be pressured; EPV progress may stall;
  Compute Sovereignty may degrade (Fragile), triggering Strategic Red
  Line (compute dependency).

  Conditions for success: Axis Optionality WIDENING or STABLE; EPV
  progress on at least one dimension; no catastrophic partner defection.

  Conditions for failure: Axis Optionality = NARROWING; or EPV stalled
  across all vectors; or Compute Sovereignty = FRAGILE.

  Discriminating evidence:
  • Watch for: Axis Optionality trend (partnership depth, new
    agreements, sanctions-exit usage); EPV milestones (e.g. BRI
    finance, yuan settlement, semiconductor substitution); partner
    public commitment or reversal
  • Signal of failure: Major partner defection; EPV regression;
    Compute Sovereignty = FRAGILE

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

OPTION C: Maritime and Spatial Consolidation (Including Taiwan Strait)

  Grounded in: Power distribution (maritime denial, first-island-chain,
  spatial integrity); legitimacy (territorial sovereignty narrative)

  Reasoning: China pursues near-seas dominance, first-island-chain
  sensitivity, and port-network sovereignty (CORE IV). Option includes
  deterrence, pressure, and conditional escalation to protect Spatial
  Integrity and resist maritime encirclement (Strategic Red Line).
  Viability depends on Escalation Stability and Spatial Integrity; if
  escalation is uncontrolled or spatial breach occurs, option fails.
  Relative framing: whether China can sustain spatial consolidation
  without opponent escalation exceeding China's escalation control
  (both curves matter; see Section VI-B).

  Key Assumptions:
  • Spatial Integrity remains INTACT or STRAINED (not BREACHED)
    — Linchpin: YES
  • Escalation Stability remains STABLE or STRAINING (not UNSTABLE)
    — Linchpin: YES
  • Time Advantage favours China or is NEUTRAL — Linchpin: NO
  • Opponent (e.g. US/Taiwan) does not escalate faster than China can
    absorb — Linchpin: YES (relative)

  Confidence: LOW to MODERATE
  Assessed against CORE–CHINA Spatial Integrity, Escalation Stability,
  Strategic Red Lines (maritime encirclement) and precedents
  MEM–CHINA–WAR–SONG–YUAN (naval/riverine as decisive),
  MEM–CHINA–GEO–TAIWAN–STRAIT, MEM–CHINA–GEO–SOUTH–CHINA–SEA. Binding
  constraint: Escalation Stability — if Escalation Stability moves to
  UNSTABLE, military or maritime pressure produces uncontrolled
  escalation and option collapses.

  Risks: Uncontrolled escalation; maritime encirclement achieved by
  adversary; Spatial Integrity BREACHED. Opponent Constraint Assessment
  (Section VI-B) required for full analysis.

  Conditions for success: Escalation remains controlled; Spatial
  Integrity intact; time and THI-CH favourable or neutral.

  Conditions for failure: Escalation Stability = UNSTABLE; Spatial
  Integrity = BREACHED; or opponent escalation dominates.

  Discriminating evidence:
  • Watch for: Escalation Stability and Spatial Integrity over 30–90
    days; opponent force posture and signalling; incident frequency and
    severity in Strait/SCS
  • Signal of failure: Uncontrolled escalation; permanent loss of
    control in key corridor; opponent achieves decisive maritime shift

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

OPTION D: Negotiated Accommodation or De-escalation

  Grounded in: Legitimacy (face-saving, narrative control); leadership
  liability (who can concede without being removed)

  Reasoning: China seeks face-saving settlement or de-escalation (e.g.
  cross-strait, trade, or crisis management) that preserves narrative
  control and avoids irreversible loss. This is the **accommodation/
  reversal** option per Template v3.3 (duty of competence). Viability
  depends on Narrative Control (message harmonisation), GRID-CH
  (reversibility of any concession), and RIR-CH (whether return-to-
  normal is still valid). If RIR-CH = ACTIVE, accommodation may be the
  only path left but "return to normal" is invalid. Doctrine 02 does
  not forbid de-escalation but constrains regime-form change.

  Key Assumptions:
  • Narrative Control remains DOMINANT or CONTESTED (not FRACTURED) so
    that accommodation can be framed — Linchpin: YES
  • GRID-CH is REVERSIBLE or STICKY (not IRREVERSIBLE) for the
    dimension being conceded — Linchpin: YES
  • RIR-CH = INACTIVE or, if ACTIVE, accommodation is explicit
    management of irreversibility — Linchpin: YES
  • Counterparty is willing to offer face-saving terms — Linchpin: YES
    (partly outside control)

  Confidence: LOW to MODERATE
  Assessed against CORE–CHINA Narrative Control, GRID-CH, RIR-CH and
  precedents MEM–CHINA–WAR–FIRST–OPIUM (face vs survival, Treaty of
  Nanjing), MEM–CHINA–PRC–KISSINGER (negotiated opening),
  MEM–CHINA–LIT–ROMANCE–THREE–KINGDOMS (face and refusal to yield).
  Binding constraint: Narrative Control — if Narrative Control =
  FRACTURED, leadership cannot harmonise message and accommodation may
  be framed as capitulation.

  Risks: Accommodation framed as surrender; GRID-CH moves to
  IRREVERSIBLE (concession locked in); counterparty does not offer
  face-saving exit.

  Conditions for success: Narrative Control sufficient to frame
  accommodation; GRID-CH allows reversibility or managed
  irreversibility; counterparty cooperates.

  Conditions for failure: Narrative Control = FRACTURED; or GRID-CH =
  IRREVERSIBLE and RIR-CH = ACTIVE with no managed narrative.

  Discriminating evidence:
  • Watch for: Narrative Control trend; public and elite reaction to
    any concession; GRID-CH and RIR-CH status after any deal
  • Signal of failure: Accommodation framed as capitulation; domestic
    legitimacy crisis triggered by concession

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

OPTION E: Compute and Industrial Sovereignty (Tech Substitution and Decoupling)

  Grounded in: Power distribution (structural capacity); CORE VII
  (Compute), VI (IRR, EAC)

  Reasoning: China prioritises domestic semiconductor substitution,
  AI model sovereignty, and manufacturing depth (IRR) to secure
  Compute Sovereignty and reduce external dependency. Strategic Red
  Line: compute dependency. Option succeeds if Compute Sovereignty is
  SECURE or CONTESTED and IRR is ABOVE or AT; fails if Compute
  Sovereignty = FRAGILE or IRR = BELOW with no path to recovery.

  Key Assumptions:
  • Compute Sovereignty remains SECURE or CONTESTED (not FRAGILE)
    — Linchpin: YES
  • IRR is ABOVE or AT (industrial replacement keeps pace)
    — Linchpin: YES
  • EAC supports workforce for tech and manufacturing (HIGH or MED)
    — Linchpin: NO
  • External supply or sanction shock does not outpace substitution
    — Linchpin: YES (partly outside control)

  Confidence: MODERATE
  Assessed against CORE–CHINA Compute Sovereignty, IRR, EAC,
  Strategic Red Lines (compute dependency) and precedents
  MEM–CHINA–PRC–DENG–XIAOPING (reform-era upgrading),
  MEM–CHINA–DYNASTY–QING (late Qing institutional rigidity and
  external pressure). Binding constraint: Compute Sovereignty — if
  Compute Sovereignty moves to FRAGILE, the option fails per
  Strategic Red Line (compute dependency).

  Risks: External cutoff before substitution completes; IRR falls
  BELOW; Compute Sovereignty = FRAGILE.

  Conditions for success: Compute Sovereignty SECURE or CONTESTED;
  IRR ABOVE or AT; substitution milestones met.

  Conditions for failure: Compute Sovereignty = FRAGILE; IRR = BELOW
  with no recovery path.

  Discriminating evidence:
  • Watch for: Compute Sovereignty assessment; IRR and EAC trends;
    semiconductor and AI supply-chain data; sanction or export-control
    events
  • Signal of failure: Compute Sovereignty = FRAGILE; critical
    supply cutoff with no near-term substitution path

VI. STABILITY INDICATORS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Assessment of internal legitimacy and feasibility signals relevant to
China's capacity and willingness to sustain material options. When
internal stress is elevated, the legitimacy and institutional
continuity perspective carries elevated analytical weight.

Indicators drawn from CIV–CORE–CHINA (Sections II, IV–XVI). Status to
be populated from STATE session evidence updates and Stability Watch
(X-C) activities.

| Indicator | Status | Assessment |
|-----------|--------|------------|
| MSI (Mandate Stability Index) | To be assessed | STABLE / STRAINING / FRACTURED. Binding for Option A. |
| PLS (Performance Legitimacy Score) | To be assessed | HIGH / MED / LOW. With SOC, drives coercive substitution or mandate fracture. |
| SOC (Social Order Coherence) | To be assessed | HIGH / MED / LOW. |
| EAL (Elite Alignment Level) | To be assessed | ALIGNED / STRESSED / FRACTURED. Binding for Option A. |
| AT (Administrative Throughput) | To be assessed | HIGH / MED / LOW. |
| LCF (Local–Central Friction) | To be assessed | LOW / MED / HIGH. |
| Spatial Integrity | To be assessed | INTACT / STRAINED / BREACHED. Binding for Option C. |
| Escalation Stability | To be assessed | STABLE / STRAINING / UNSTABLE. Binding for Option C. |
| Internal Stability | To be assessed | HIGH / MED / LOW. |
| Narrative Control | To be assessed | DOMINANT / CONTESTED / FRACTURED. Binding for Option D. |
| Time Advantage | To be assessed | CHINA / ADVERSARY / NEUTRAL. |
| EPV (Exit Progress Vector) | To be assessed | FINANCE / LOGISTICS / COMPUTE / ALL. Relevant to Option B. |
| Axis Optionality | To be assessed | WIDENING / STABLE / NARROWING. Binding for Option B. |
| Compute Sovereignty | To be assessed | SECURE / CONTESTED / FRAGILE. Binding for Option E. |
| IRR (Industrial Replacement Rate) | To be assessed | ABOVE / AT / BELOW. Relevant to Option E. |
| SAF-CH | To be assessed | INTACT / FRACTURED / FAILED. Composite; all options. |
| THI-CH | To be assessed | ALLY / NEUTRAL / HOSTILE. |
| GRID-CH | To be assessed | REVERSIBLE / STICKY / IRREVERSIBLE. Relevant to Option D. |
| RIR-CH | To be assessed | INACTIVE / ACTIVE. If ACTIVE, return-to-normal invalid. |

Current assessment: To be populated in first Stability Watch (X-C) or
evidence-update session. Threshold watch: If MSI moves to FRACTURED or
EAL to FRACTURED, Option A and sustainability of continuity-dominant
path require re-assessment. If Escalation Stability = UNSTABLE,
Option C fails. If Narrative Control = FRACTURED, Option D is at risk.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI-B. OPPONENT CONSTRAINT ASSESSMENT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Applicability: Material options C (Maritime/Spatial) and partly A
depend on the behaviour of the United States, Taiwan, and regional
allies. This section tracks the principal opponent or counterpart for
the Taiwan Strait commitment space.

UNITED STATES / ALLIES (Taiwan Strait):

  Dimension: Extended deterrence; force posture; escalation control;
  willingness to bear cost.
  Binding constraint (opponent side): US and allies cannot sustain
  credible deterrence or escalation dominance without domestic and
  alliance willingness to bear cost; their degradation curve (political
  will, force posture, coalition cohesion) is the variable. If US
  commitment holds and escalation control favours them, Option C is
  constrained; if US commitment or capability degrades faster than
  China's, spatial consolidation becomes more feasible.
  Discriminating signals: Force posture and basing in theatre;
  alliance rhetoric and burden-sharing; incident response and
  escalation management; domestic US debate on commitment level.

TAIWAN:

  Dimension: Alignment, defection, and resistance. Success of Option C
  depends on whether Taiwan and its backers resist or accommodate;
  Option D depends on counterparty willingness to offer face-saving
  terms.
  Binding constraint (entity side): Whether China's pressure and
  narrative sustain or fracture Taiwan's alignment with US; whether
  Taiwan leadership can credibly offer or resist accommodation.
  Discriminating signals: Taiwan rhetoric and policy; US–Taiwan
  coordination; public opinion and elite cohesion on the island.

Relative assessment: The "degradation" curve that matters for Option C
is relative: does China's escalation control and spatial consolidation
pace hold against opponent escalation and deterrence? Monitoring both
curves (China's Escalation Stability and Spatial Integrity; opponent
force posture and commitment) is required. Surface contradictions
between sources when assessing opponent capacity (ARC Source Coverage).

VII. DECISION-RELEVANT HISTORY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Historical patterns with current relevance, drawn from CIV–SCHOLAR–
CHINA, CIV–DOCTRINE–CHINA, and the CHINA MEM corpus. Precedent MEMs
are cited for traceability; session MEM SCAN should read file
contents and extract specific details for grounded parallels.

PATTERN: Corridor and Decisive Node — Maritime / Riverine Control
  Activation: HIGH
  Source: MEM–CHINA–WAR–SONG–YUAN; MEM–CHINA–GRAND–CANAL
  Relevance: When a southern polity held the Yangtze valley and the
  coast, overland invasion alone could not finish it—rivers and naval
  and fortified positions had to be crossed and faced. The side that
  could also fight on water gained the advantage: bulk logistics and
  siege could be sustained only when grain and materiel moved along
  the corridor linking Yellow and Yangtze, with control of locks and
  junctions giving control of flow. The siege of Xiangyang (1268–1273)
  became the decisive node; a joint naval–ground operation broke
  resistance along the Han and Yangtze. After Xiangyang fell, forces
  could project downriver and along the coast, and the southern
  polity collapsed within years. For any decision involving maritime
  or riverine control—strait, canal, or coastal corridor—who holds
  the key nodes can strangle the capital or the campaign; loss of the
  decisive node removes the linchpin for downstream resistance.
  Direct relevance to Option C (maritime and spatial consolidation).

PATTERN: Mandate Under External Pressure — Vacillation and Irreversible Convergence
  Activation: HIGH
  Source: MEM–CHINA–DYNASTY–QING; MEM–CHINA–WAR–BOXER–REBELLION
  Relevance: Peak imperial reach was achieved through Sinicized
  administration and retained institutions, while fiscal strain grew
  as population outpaced state capacity and military modernisation
  failed. External encroachment converged with internal rebellion and
  court weakness. The court first tolerated, then endorsed,
  anti-foreign violence, then capitulated when a coalition relieved
  the besieged legations, occupied the capital, and imposed indemnity
  and permanent foreign military presence. The sovereign fled; the
  Protocol fixed the "century of humiliation" in strategic memory and
  accelerated loss of legitimacy. For any decision involving mandate
  stability under external pressure: vacillation between endorsement
  and capitulation exposes the regime; fiscal and military capacity
  that lag behind population and external threat produce irreversible
  convergence (Doctrine 01); defeat encoded in narrative outlasts the
  immediate settlement.
  Direct relevance to Option A (continuity dominance; MSI, PLS, SOC)
  and Option D (accommodation; narrative and face-saving).

VIII. CROSS-ENTITY LINKS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

From CIV–CORE–CHINA XIII (Cross–Civilizational Synchronization).
Key distinctions and relationship dimensions for STATE purposes.

UNITED STATES / ANGLIA:
  Dimension: Containment rival; primary counterpart for Taiwan Strait
  deterrence and for tech/compute competition.
  Key distinction: US is the principal extra-regional power constraining
  Option C (maritime consolidation) and affecting Option E (compute,
  sanctions). Option B (exit-building) is partly motivated by reducing
  dependency on US-led order.

RUSSIA:
  Dimension: Depth partner; sanctions-exit and strategic alignment.
  Key distinction: Russia supports Axis Optionality (Option B); partner
  willingness and capacity affect exit-building viability. Not the
  principal opponent for Taiwan Strait.

INDIA:
  Dimension: Competitor–balancer; regional and maritime dynamics.
  Key distinction: Affects southern and Indian Ocean flank; not primary
  for Taiwan Strait decision space.

PERSIA (IRAN):
  Dimension: Sanctions-exit ally; axis diversification.
  Key distinction: Relevant to Option B (Axis Optionality, EPV).

EUROPE / GERMANIA:
  Dimension: Industrial complement; regulatory and trade friction.
  Key distinction: Affects compute, trade, and narrative alignment;
  secondary to US for Strait and containment.

ENTRY 001 — February 2026
  Session: Initial STATE file creation
  Sources analysed: CIV–CORE–CHINA v3.0, CIV–SCHOLAR–CHINA v3.0,
  CIV–DOCTRINE–CHINA v1.0, PREP–STATE–CHINA Exercises 2–5,
  MEM–RELEVANCE–CHINA v1.0, MEM–CHINA–WAR–SONG–YUAN, MEM–CHINA–
  GRAND–CANAL, MEM–CHINA–DYNASTY–QING, MEM–CHINA–WAR–BOXER–REBELLION
  Options established: A (Continuity Dominance), B (Exit-Building),
  C (Maritime/Spatial), D (Negotiated Accommodation), E (Compute/
  Industrial Sovereignty)
  Completeness audit: PASSED
  Stability indicators: Structure in place; status to be populated in
  first Stability Watch or evidence-update session
  Entity framed as civilization-state with principal external
  commitment space in Taiwan Strait and reunification; internal
  stability, exit-building, and compute sovereignty as parallel domains.

ENTRY 002 — February 2026
  Session: Doctrine audit — CIV–DOCTRINE–CHINA vs current Chinese
  foreign policy (evidence: past 7 days news)
  Activity: STATE–CHINA; doctrine check against Doctrines 01–03.
  Sources: CIV–DOCTRINE–CHINA v1.0, CIV–CORE–CHINA v3.0; FMPRC,
  China.org.cn (ARC–CHINA–T-INSTITUTIONAL/OFFICIAL); Reuters, NBC,
  Focus Taiwan, Taipei Times, Foreign Policy (cross-entity/general).
  Result: 01 Neutral (no violation; exhaustion risk flagged); 02
  Aligned (party–state monopoly, no constitutional path); 03
  Consistent (corridor/connectivity logic). Contradiction surfaced:
  Chinese framing (Taiwan “most important,” “prudence” on arms) vs
  US–Taiwan “rock solid” / trade deal; not resolved.
  Output: docs/governance/STATE–CHINA–DOCTRINE–AUDIT–2026–02–13.md

ENTRY 003 — February 2026
  Session: DIB–CHINA accepted — Doctrine 03 refinement (scope and
  contemporary application)
  Change: CIV–DOCTRINE–CHINA v1.0 → v1.1. Doctrine 03 (Conquest-as-
  Connectivity) updated with "Scope and Contemporary Application"
  subsection: historical pattern (Mongol/Yuan) retained; contemporary
  connectivity initiatives (e.g. BRI) may be officially characterised
  as voluntary and independent of coercion without invalidating the
  pattern. Source: SYNTHESIS 0013 (CIV–SCHOLAR–CHINA); DIB package
  docs/governance/DIB–CHINA–DOCTRINE–03–REFINEMENT–2026–02–13.md.
  CIV–SCHOLAR–CHINA updated (SYNTHESIS 0013 FROZEN; Doctrine Registry
  note). No change to material options or stability indicators.
