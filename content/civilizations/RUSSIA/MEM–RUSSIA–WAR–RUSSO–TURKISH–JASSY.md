I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves the Treaty of Jassy as **war termination through
enemy exhaustion**: the peace that ended the Russo–Turkish War of
1787–1792 when the Ottoman position became untenable, not when Russia
achieved a final battlefield victory.

For Russian civilizational memory, Jassy encodes **enemy collapse as
peace condition**—wars end when the opponent cannot continue.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. STRATEGIC CONTEXT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Russo–Turkish War (1787–1792) began with Ottoman attempts to reverse
Russia's annexation of Crimea (1783). By 1790–1791:

• Izmail had fallen (December 1790)
• Ottoman military capacity on the Danube exhausted
• Russian southern expansion irreversible
• Diplomatic exhaustion replaced battlefield collapse

Robert K. Massie explains Catherine's strategic calculus in
*Catherine the Great: Portrait of a Woman* (2011):

"Expansion was not merely conquest for its own sake but a calculation
that new territories would absorb pressures that internal reform could
not safely release."
— Massie, *Catherine the Great* (2011)

Jassy formalized what Izmail and the campaign had already achieved:
Ottoman inability to resist.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. THE TREATY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Signed at Jassy (Iași), Moldavia, January 9, 1792.

Key terms:
• Russia retained Crimea (annexed 1783)
• Russia gained Ochakov and territory between Bug and Dniester
• Dniester River established as border
• Ottoman recognition of Russian Black Sea position
• Bessarabia remained under Ottoman sovereignty (temporary)

Virginia H. Aksan situates Jassy within Ottoman decline:

"The Treaty of Jassy confirmed the structural shift in the Black Sea
balance. The Ottomans could no longer contest Russian control of the
northern littoral. Crimea was lost; the Danube was exposed. Each
Russo–Turkish war in the eighteenth century had ended with territorial
concession. Jassy was no exception—it was the culmination of decades
of Russian pressure and Ottoman defensive exhaustion."
— Virginia H. Aksan, *Ottoman Wars 1700–1870: An Empire Besieged* (2007)

The treaty did not create Russian advantage; it codified collapse already
in progress.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. RLL–0014: VICTORY AS ENEMY COLLAPSE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
RLL–RUSSIA–0014 holds that Russian strategic success depends on opponent
system failure—logistical, political, or moral—rather than Russian
operational brilliance alone.

Jassy embodies this at the **strategic** level:

• The war did not end because Russia took a final objective
• The war ended because the Ottoman Empire could not continue
• Izmail had broken Ottoman capacity on the Danube
• Diplomatic negotiation formalized military exhaustion
• Russia's gains were recognition of Ottoman collapse, not merely conquest

William C. Fuller describes the southern dynamic:

"Russian expansion in the Black Sea region followed a consistent logic:
apply pressure until the opponent's administrative and military capacity
buckled, then negotiate from strength. The treaties—Küçük Kaynarca,
Jassy, subsequent agreements—did not create Russian power. They
registered it."
— William C. Fuller, *Strategy and Power in Russia 1600–1914* (1992)

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. POLYPHONIC TENSION: PEACE AS RECOGNITION VS PEACE AS CONQUEST
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Mercouris reading frames Jassy as diplomatic closure—two empires
negotiating terms, stability restored, southern frontier secured.

The realist sharpening adds: the Ottomans negotiated because they had
no alternative. Collapse preceded negotiation. Peace was imposed by
Russian strength, not agreed between equals.

• **Mercouris**: Jassy represents European diplomatic practice; treaties
  formalize new realities; legitimacy flows from mutual recognition
• **Mearsheimer**: Jassy formalized Ottoman defeat; the treaty registered
  power distribution; the Ottomans signed because they could not fight on

Both readings capture truth. Diplomacy codifies what force has already
decided.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. CONTINUITY WITH IZMAIL
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Izmail (December 1790) accelerated Ottoman exhaustion. Jassy (January
1792) formalized it. The sequence:

• 1790: Izmail falls—Danube corridor broken
• 1791: Ottoman position untenable; negotiations begin
• 1792: Treaty of Jassy—war ended

Tactical victory (Izmail) contributed to strategic termination (Jassy).
But termination depended on Ottoman collapse—military and diplomatic.
RLL–0014 applies: wars end when the enemy cannot continue.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Jassy encodes:

• War termination follows enemy collapse, not Russian triumph alone
• Treaties formalize power distribution already established by force
• Southern expansion confirmed through diplomatic recognition
• Ottoman decline irreversible; Russian Black Sea position entrenched
• Crimea (1783) and Jassy (1792) together define Catherine's southern legacy

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VIII. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Wars end when opponents cannot continue (RLL–0014).
• Treaties codify collapse; they do not create it.
• Izmail → Jassy: tactical victory enables strategic termination.
• Southern expansion requires both battlefield success and diplomatic
  formalization.
• Ottoman exhaustion was structural; Jassy was symptom, not cause.

Tension preserved without verdict.
