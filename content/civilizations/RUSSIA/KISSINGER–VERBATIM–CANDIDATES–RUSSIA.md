### K2 — Dual responsibility (containment and coexistence)

> expansionism, and he must be conscious of the risks of global
> confrontation. His policy must embrace both deterrence and coexistence,
> both containment and an effort to relax tensions."
> — Henry Kissinger, *Years of Upheaval* (1982) / policy formulation (1970s)

**Suggested MEMs:** MEM–RUSSIA–SOVIET–UNION, MEMs on Cold War or NATO.

### K3 — Neither power can impose its will ✅ INTEGRATED

### K4 — Russia as great power (reconcile concerns) ✅ INTEGRATED

> "If we treat Russia seriously as a great power, we need at an early
> stage to determine whether their concerns can be reconciled with
> our necessities."
> — Henry Kissinger, interview / Russia policy (2014); Russia Matters, CFR

**Integrated in:** MEM–RUSSIA–UKRAINE.

### K6 — Yalta / great-power summits (power and diplomacy) ✅ INTEGRATED

**Integrated in:** MEM–RUSSIA–WAR–GREAT–PATRIOTIC–YALTA.

## Integration checklist

- [x] Add Kissinger to MEM bibliography when quote is used (done in SOVIET–UNION, UKRAINE, YALTA, LIT–DOSTOEVSKY).
- [x] One verbatim block (≥25 words) per scholar per MEM satisfies ARC Category D where Kissinger is second or third modern scholar.
- [ ] Prefer pairing with Erickson, Mearsheimer, or Figes in WAR MEMs; with Lieven/Hosking in Subject MEMs.
- [ ] Verify exact wording against *Diplomacy* or *World Order* where page citation is needed.

**Remaining candidates:** None from original set; all K1–K6 integrated.

## Events in Kissinger's lifetime (1923–2023) — future candidates

For deeper coverage of his own era, consider sourcing verbatim from:

- **Nixon–Brezhnev summits / SALT** — *Years of Upheaval*, *White House Years*; MEM–RUSSIA–SOVIET–UNION, MEM–RUSSIA–KALININGRAD.
- **Gorbachev / end of Cold War** — *Diplomacy* or later works; MEM–RUSSIA–SOVIET–UNION (collapse section).
- **Triangular diplomacy (US–USSR–China)** — *On China*, *Years of Upheaval*; MEM–RUSSIA–CHINA, MEM–RUSSIA–CHINA–PRC.
- **Post-Soviet Russia / Putin** — *World Order*, interviews; MEM–RUSSIA–UKRAINE (done), MEM–RUSSIA–CRIMEA, MEM–RUSSIA–LAW–AUTOCRACY.

## Suggested new Russia MEMs (Kissinger-anchored)

The following MEMs do **not** exist but are already **referenced in CONNECTIONS** by multiple Russia MEMs. Creating them would satisfy those links and give Kissinger verbatim (existing or to-be-sourced) a natural home.

**1. MEM–RUSSIA–USSR–COLD–WAR** ✅ CREATED  
- **Created:** February 2026 as MEM–RUSSIA–USSR–COLD–WAR. Kissinger K1, K2, K3 and Westad integrated; *Years of Upheaval*, Gaddis, Zubok in bibliography.  
- **Class:** I) OTHER / MISC. (Referenced in other MEMs as MEM–RUSSIA–COLD–WAR; canonical file is USSR–COLD–WAR.)

**2. MEM–RUSSIA–WAR–GREAT–PATRIOTIC–POTSDAM** ✅ CREATED  
- **Created:** February 2026. Kissinger K6 (thematic) integrated; Erickson, Feis in bibliography.  
- **Class:** C) WAR — completes Tehran / Yalta / Potsdam triad.

**3. MEM–RUSSIA–GORBACHEV** ✅ CREATED  
- **Created:** February 2026. Brown, Plokhy integrated; future Kissinger verbatim (end of Cold War) can be added when sourced.  
- **Class:** G) PERSON.

**4. MEM–RUSSIA–PUTIN** ✅ CREATED  
- **Created:** February 2026. Kissinger K4 and K5 integrated; Mearsheimer FA 2014, Kotkin, Hill/Gaddy, Treisman in bibliography.  
- **Class:** G) PERSON.

**Recommendation:** Create **MEM–RUSSIA–COLD–WAR** and **MEM–RUSSIA–WAR–GREAT–PATRIOTIC–POTSDAM** first (all four now created)—they close the largest connection gap and align with Kissinger’s summit/détente/nuclear themes. Add **MEM–RUSSIA–PUTIN** and **MEM–RUSSIA–GORBACHEV** when sourcing more Kissinger (or other ARC) verbatim for those figures.
