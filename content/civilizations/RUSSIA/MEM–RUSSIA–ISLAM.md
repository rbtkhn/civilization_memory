I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves **Islam's place in Russian civilizational memory**:
the faith of the sovereign who once ruled the Rus' (Golden Horde), of
the khanates Russia conquered (Kazan, Astrakhan, Crimea, Sibir), of the
Ottoman rival to the south, and of populations integrated into the
empire and then the USSR—today the largest Muslim population in Europe.

For Russian civilizational memory, Islam is not a single object. It is
**sovereign layer, conquered other, external enemy, and managed
constituency**—successively and sometimes simultaneously.

This MEM preserves:
• Early encounter: Khazars, Volga Bulgars, and the context of Rus' choice of Orthodox Christianity
• Golden Horde: Islam as the religion of the overlord
• Successor khanates: Islam as the faith of conquered polities
• Imperial integration: toleration, Orenburg Assembly, co-optation of elites
• Ottoman rivalry: Islam as external civilizational counterweight
• Soviet period: suppression, then institutional co-optation (SADUM)
• Post-Soviet: revival, North Caucasus insurgency, and domestic Muslim population as fact

What this MEM does NOT resolve:
• Whether Russian policy has been "tolerant" or "imperial" in any final sense
• Whether Islam in Russia is a single community or multiple
• Whether current management will prove stable

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

II. EARLY ENCOUNTER: KHAZARS, VOLGA BULGARS, AND THE CHOICE OF FAITH
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Islam entered the Rus' horizon before Orthodox Christianity was adopted.

The Volga Bulgars converted to Islam in the early 10th century; the
Khazar Khaganate entertained Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Rus'
traded and warred with both. The Primary Chronicle and other sources
record the "choice of faith" (c. 986–988): Vladimir considered Islam
among options before choosing Byzantine Christianity.

Ibn Fadlān's account of the Volga Bulgars (922) and Islamic
geographers' descriptions of Rus' establish that **Islam was present at
the founding moment of Russian civilizational orientation**—rejected
as sovereign faith but remaining in the landscape as neighbour and
trading partner.

Christian Raffensperger notes the structural point:

"The choice of Christianity over Islam for Kievan Rus' was not
inevitable. Islam was a living option—the Volga Bulgars had recently
converted, and the Khazars had a sophisticated multi-confessional
polity. Vladimir's choice tied Rus' to Byzantium and the Mediterranean
Christian world. It did not remove Islam from the story; it placed
Russia in a world where Islam would remain the faith of the steppe
powers that would later dominate the Rus' principalities."
— Christian Raffensperger, *The Kingdom of Rus'* (2017)

Islam is thus encoded as **the road not taken**—and as the faith of
powers that would soon rule over Rus'.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. GOLDEN HORDE: ISLAM AS SOVEREIGN LAYER
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Mongols of the Golden Horde adopted Islam. The Horde became the
sovereign interface between the steppe and the Rus' principalities;
its religion was the religion of the overlord.

Berke Khan (r. 1257–1266) converted; by the 14th century Islam was
firmly established as the Horde's confessional identity. The Rus'
princes received yarliks (charters) from Muslim khans; tribute flowed
to a Muslim court. Russian memory encodes this as **subordination to
Islamic sovereignty**—not to a distant caliphate but to a direct,
extractive power.

Donald Ostrowski summarizes the implication:

"The Golden Horde was a Muslim state. The Rus' princes who travelled
to Sarai to receive their patents of rule did obeisance to Muslim
rulers. Tribute was paid to a khanate that built mosques and
patronized Islamic learning. The Russian Orthodox Church survived and
was even favoured with tax exemptions—but the sovereign to whom Rus'
deferred was Islamic. The memory of that subordination shaped later
Russian attitudes toward Muslim politics: they had been under Muslim
rule; to reverse that relationship was to invert the order of the world."
— Donald Ostrowski, *Muscovy and the Mongols* (1998)

Islam in this phase is **the faith of the master**—a relationship
that conquest of the khanates would later overturn.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. SUCCESSOR KHANATES: KAZAN, ASTRAKHAN, CRIMEA, SIBIR
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
As the Horde fragmented, Islam became the faith of **rival polities**
that Muscovy would conquer or confront.

Kazan (conquered 1552), Astrakhan (1556), the Crimean Khanate (vassal
of the Ottomans, annexed 1783), and the Sibir Khanate (conquered late
16th c.) were Turkic-Muslim states. Conquest meant the incorporation
of Muslim populations and the destruction or subordination of Islamic
institutions—mosques, madrasas, courts.

Robert D. Crews frames imperial policy:

"The Russian Empire did not seek to eliminate Islam. It sought to
administer it. After the conquest of Kazan, Ivan IV destroyed the
mosques of the city but permitted Tatar nobles to retain land and
status in exchange for service. Over time, the state created
institutions—the Orenburg Muslim Spiritual Assembly (1788)—to
regulate Islamic clergy and law. Islam became a recognized confession
within the empire: protected in law, supervised by the state, and
instrumentalized for loyalty. The empire managed Islam rather than
eradicating it."
— Robert D. Crews, *For Prophet and Tsar: Islam and Empire in Russia and Central Asia* (2006)

Islam here is **conquered but preserved**—a confessional community
under imperial control.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. IMPERIAL INTEGRATION: TOLERATION, ASSEMBLY, CO-OPTATION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Catherine II's creation of the Orenburg Muslim Spiritual Assembly
(1788) gave Russian Islam an official hierarchy: state-appointed
muftis, registered clergy, and Sharia courts within bounds set by
imperial law. The Assembly extended to Crimea and parts of the
Caucasus as the empire grew.

The logic was **legitimacy through incorporation**. Muslim elites could
serve the empire; the empire could speak through them. Tatar merchants
and soldiers became agents of Russian expansion in Central Asia. The
alternative—persecution or forced conversion—was used selectively
(e.g., in some Orthodox missionary campaigns) but was not the default.
The default was **managed pluralism**.

Dominic Lieven observes:

"The Russian Empire was a multi-confessional state. Orthodoxy was the
dominant faith, but Islam, Buddhism, Judaism, and Protestantism were
tolerated and regulated. The tsars presented themselves as protectors
of their Muslim subjects—especially against the Ottomans, who could
claim to be the defenders of the umma. Russian policy aimed to make
empire legitimate in the eyes of Muslims by offering order, patronage,
and a place within the imperial hierarchy. It was a form of
civilizational management, not eradication."
— Dominic Lieven, *Empire: The Russian Empire and Its Rivals* (2001)

Strategic constraint (Mearsheimer sharpening): managing Islam reduced
rebellion risk and freed resources for external competition; the
empire could not afford permanent religious war on the interior.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. OTTOMAN RIVALRY: ISLAM AS EXTERNAL ENEMY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Beyond the border, Islam was embodied by the **Ottoman Empire**—sultan
and caliph, holder of Constantinople, patron of the Crimean Khanate.
Russo-Ottoman wars framed Islam as the faith of the southern rival.
Victory over the Ottomans was framed as Christian victory; the
"protection" of Orthodox populations in the Balkans and the Caucasus
legitimated expansion.

Islam in this register is **external adversary**—the confessional
marker of a power that had to be contained and then rolled back. The
internal management of Muslim subjects and the external confrontation
with the Ottoman Empire coexisted: the same state that regulated
muftis at home fought the Caliphate abroad.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI.A POLYPHONIC TENSION: LEGITIMACY VS CONTROL
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Mercouris reading stresses **legitimacy and institutional
continuity**: the empire offered Muslims a place; the Assembly and
toleration created a durable modus vivendi; Russian Islam developed
within imperial frames and produced loyal elites.

The Mearsheimer sharpening adds: **control was the strategic
variable**. Toleration was cost-effective; rebellion was expensive.
Co-opted elites reduced monitoring costs. The same logic that favoured
managed Islam at home favoured defeating the Ottoman state abroad—
power distribution, not civilizational sympathy, drove policy.

Both readings are valid. Tension preserved without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. SOVIET PERIOD: ATHEISM, SUPPRESSION, CO-OPTATION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Bolsheviks initially attacked religion; mosques were closed,
clergy repressed, waqf property seized. Then the state shifted:
**institutional co-optation**. The Spiritual Administration of the
Muslims of Central Asia and Kazakhstan (SADUM), later extended,
became the sole permitted structure for "official" Islam. Muftis were
state-approved; mosques that reopened did so under strict control.
Islam was not eliminated; it was **administered**.

Shireen Hunter describes the outcome:

"Soviet policy toward Islam was contradictory. On one hand, atheism was
state doctrine and religious practice was discouraged. On the other,
the state created a hierarchy of Muslim clerics who could speak for
'Soviet Muslims' abroad and at home. The USSR presented itself to the
Muslim world as a friend of anti-colonial movements and as a society
where Muslims had equality. Domestically, Islam was contained within
institutions that the party could monitor. The result was a hollowed-
out but surviving Islamic infrastructure—and a population that would
revive religious identity when the state weakened."
— Shireen Hunter, *Islam in Russia: The Politics of Identity and Security* (2004)

Post-Soviet revival and the North Caucasus insurgency (Chechnya,
Dagestan, etc.) are encoded as **the return of Islam as a political
and identity factor**—no longer fully managed by a single hierarchy.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VIII. CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
In Russian memory, Islam encodes:

• The faith of the sovereign who once ruled the Rus' (Golden Horde)
• The faith of the khanates Russia conquered—Kazan, Crimea, Astrakhan
• The faith of the Ottoman rival and the southern wars
• The faith of millions of imperial and Soviet subjects—managed, not erased
• Institutional continuity: Assembly, SADUM, and post-Soviet muftiates
• Legitimacy through incorporation: Muslims as servants of the state
• Strategic constraint: managing Islam at home, confronting Islamic powers abroad

Islam is remembered as **sovereign layer, conquered other, external
enemy, and managed constituency**—a relationship that has never been
resolved into a single story.
