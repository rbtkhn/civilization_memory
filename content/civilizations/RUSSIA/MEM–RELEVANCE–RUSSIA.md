MEM–RELEVANCE–RUSSIA — v1.0
Civilizational Memory Codex · MEM Relevance Index

Status: ACTIVE
Version: 1.0
Entity: Russia / Russian Federation
Purpose: Maps COUNSEL-relevant analytical dimensions to MEM files
Last Updated: February 2026

This index enables the Decision Points activity and other COUNSEL
analyses to quickly identify which MEM files contain relevant historical
parallels, patterns, and precedents for the current decision space.

Organised by the analytical dimensions that recur in CIV–COUNSEL–RUSSIA.
Each dimension lists MEMs ranked by relevance (primary = central to the
dimension; secondary = relevant context).

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
HOW TO USE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. Identify the analytical dimension of the current Decision Point
   (e.g. "fiscal constraint" or "attrition/endurance")
2. Consult the relevant section below
3. Load primary MEMs first; secondary MEMs for depth
4. Cross-reference: a Decision Point may span multiple dimensions

XII. MAINTENANCE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This index is manually maintained. Update when:
• A new MEM is tagged with concepts
• A new COUNSEL dimension emerges from Decision Points sessions
• An analytical gap is discovered (as in Session 004's opponent
  constraint miss — leading to Section X above)

When the full concept-based retrieval system is activated
(PROPOSAL–TIERED–RETRIEVAL), this index will be superseded by
automated concept queries.
