I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves Russia–Korea interaction as **the encounter between
continental empire and strategic buffer state**: Korea as the territory
over which Russia collided with Japan, and later as the peninsula where
Cold War division crystallized into permanent partition.

For Russian memory, Korea is **the space between powers**—a zone where
Russian interests intersect with Japanese, Chinese, and American influence.

This MEM preserves:
• Korea as the catalyst for Russo–Japanese War (1904–05)
• Soviet liberation and occupation (1945)
• North Korea as communist client state
• Contemporary nuclear diplomacy

What this MEM does NOT resolve:
• Whether Korean reunification serves or threatens Russian interests
• Whether DPRK nuclear capacity is asset or liability for Moscow
• Whether Russia can maintain influence as China's role expands

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. IMPERIAL COMPETITION OVER KOREA (1860–1904)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Russian interest in Korea emerged from Pacific expansion.

Korea's strategic value:
• Ice-free ports for Pacific Fleet
• Buffer against Japanese expansion
• Access to Manchurian resources
• Potential sphere of influence

S.C.M. Paine describes the imperial dynamic:

"Korea became the focal point of Russo–Japanese rivalry. Both powers
sought influence over the decrepit Joseon dynasty. Japan saw Korea as
essential to its security—a 'dagger pointed at the heart of Japan' if
controlled by a hostile power. Russia saw Korea as the natural extension
of its Manchurian expansion. Neither would accept the other's dominance.
War became inevitable not because of Korean actions, but because of
great power calculations that treated Korea as object, not actor."
— S.C.M. Paine, *The Sino-Japanese War of 1894–1895* (2003)

Russia underestimated Japanese resolve; Japan did not underestimate
Russian ambition.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. THE RUSSO–JAPANESE WAR AND KOREAN LOSS (1904–1905)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
War decided Korea's fate.

Ian Nish explains the outcome:

"The Treaty of Portsmouth ended Russian ambitions in Korea definitively.
Japan gained recognition of its 'paramount interest' in Korea—diplomatic
language that meant protectorate and, within five years, annexation.
Russia withdrew from the Korean equation. The defeat at Tsushima
destroyed not only the Baltic Fleet but Russian pretensions to Pacific
power. Korea passed from the Russian sphere to the Japanese, and would
remain outside Russian influence for forty years."
— Ian Nish, *The Origins of the Russo-Japanese War* (1985)

The 1905 defeat removed Russia from Korean affairs until 1945.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III.A POLYPHONIC TENSION: PERIPHERAL VS CENTRAL INTEREST
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Mercouris reading frames the 1905 defeat as consequence of
misperception: Russia treated Korea as peripheral while Japan treated
it as existential—the priority mismatch proved fatal.

The realist sharpening adds: Russia could not have won regardless.

• Mercouris: Russia lost Korea because it underestimated Japanese
  commitment and overestimated its own capacity for Pacific projection;
  different leadership might have produced different calculations
• Mearsheimer: Continental powers cannot project decisive force across
  oceanic distances against maritime powers on their home territory;
  Japan's local superiority was structurally insurmountable

Both readings capture truth:
• Russia did miscalculate Japanese resolve
• Russia also faced structural disadvantages in Pacific power projection
• Better strategy would have lost less catastrophically
• No strategy could have secured Korea against determined Japanese opposition

Tension preserved without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. SOVIET LIBERATION AND DIVISION (1945)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Second World War restored Russian influence.

Events:
• Soviet declaration of war against Japan (August 8, 1945)
• Rapid advance through Manchuria and northern Korea
• 38th parallel division (August 1945)
• Soviet occupation north of the line
• Installation of Kim Il-sung regime

Charles Armstrong describes the Soviet role:

"The Soviet occupation of northern Korea was brief but transformative.
In three years (1945–1948), Soviet advisors helped establish a communist
state modeled on Stalinist lines: land reform, nationalization of industry,
suppression of opposition, and creation of a personality cult around
Kim Il-sung. The division of Korea was not planned as permanent, but the
Cold War made it so. The 38th parallel, chosen for military convenience,
became an ideological frontier that endures to this day."
— Charles Armstrong, *The North Korean Revolution, 1945–1950* (2003)

Soviet occupation created a client state that would outlast the Soviet Union.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. THE KOREAN WAR (1950–1953)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Korea became a Cold War battlefield.

Soviet involvement:
• Stalin approved Kim Il-sung's invasion plan (1950)
• Soviet pilots flew combat missions (covertly)
• Soviet weapons equipped DPRK and Chinese forces
• Direct Soviet ground involvement avoided

Kathryn Weathersby explains Stalin's calculation:

"Stalin authorized the Korean War believing American intervention was
unlikely. He miscalculated. But he also limited Soviet exposure—no Soviet
ground troops, no public acknowledgment of Soviet pilots. The war served
Soviet interests by tying down American forces in Asia, by testing Western
resolve, and by strengthening the Sino-Soviet alliance. When the war
stalemated, Stalin had achieved his minimum objectives: a divided Korea
with a communist north, preserved as buffer against American-allied Japan."
— Kathryn Weathersby, *Soviet Aims in Korea and the Origins of the Korean War* (1993)

The war confirmed partition and embedded Korea in Cold War structure.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V.A POLYPHONIC TENSION: STRATEGIC SUCCESS VS HUMANITARIAN COST
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Mercouris reading frames the Korean War as Stalin's miscalculation
that produced unintended consequences: millions dead, China locked into
conflict with the US, resources diverted from domestic development.

The realist sharpening adds: the outcome served Soviet structural interests.

• Mercouris: Stalin miscalculated; the war's costs exceeded its benefits;
  Chinese casualties damaged Sino-Soviet relations long-term; the war
  accelerated American rearmament
• Mearsheimer: From structural perspective, the war succeeded: North Korea
  survived, American forces remained tied to Asia, and Japan remained
  inhibited from rearmament; partition served Soviet security

Both readings are valid:
• Stalin did miscalculate immediate American response
• The war did serve long-term structural Soviet interests
• The humanitarian cost was staggering
• Strategic logic operated regardless of human suffering

Tension preserved without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. NORTH KOREA AS CLIENT STATE (1953–1991)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The DPRK developed as Soviet-dependent client.

Relationship dimensions:
• Soviet military equipment and training
• Economic subsidies and trade preferences
• Political backing in UN and international forums
• Nuclear technology transfer (civilian program)

Andrei Lankov explains the dependency:

"North Korea was economically unviable without Soviet support. Soviet
oil, Soviet machinery, Soviet markets—all were essential. Kim Il-sung
played Moscow against Beijing, extracting aid from both, but the Soviet
connection was primary. When the USSR collapsed, North Korea lost its
economic lifeline. The famine of the 1990s was a direct consequence of
Soviet withdrawal. The DPRK survived, but only by developing nuclear
weapons as the ultimate self-reliance strategy."
— Andrei Lankov, *The Real North Korea* (2013)

Soviet collapse transformed North Korea from client to nuclear-armed orphan.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. POST-SOVIET RELATIONS AND NUCLEAR DIPLOMACY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The relationship fundamentally changed after 1991.

Post-Soviet developments:
• Russian recognition of South Korea (1990)
• Economic ties with DPRK collapsed
• Six-Party Talks participation (2003–2009)
• Limited Putin-era re-engagement
• DPRK nuclear and missile testing

Fyodor Tertitskiy describes the transformation:

"Russia's relationship with North Korea after 1991 became a shadow of
Soviet-era ties. Moscow recognized Seoul, established diplomatic and
economic relations with the South, and watched helplessly as the North
developed nuclear weapons. Putin attempted modest re-engagement—Kim
Jong-il's 2001 train journey to Russia, debt forgiveness, labor migration
programs—but Russia lacks leverage. China has become the DPRK's primary
patron. Russia is reduced to spectator status on the Korean peninsula."
— Fyodor Tertitskiy, *Russia's Policy Toward the Korean Peninsula* (2019)

Russia retains formal influence but limited actual leverage.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VIII. CONTEMPORARY STRATEGIC SIGNIFICANCE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Korea remains strategically relevant for multiple reasons.

Russian interests:
• Preventing US-allied unified Korea on Russian border
• Maintaining leverage in Six-Party framework
• Balancing Chinese influence over DPRK
• Trans-Korean railway and pipeline possibilities
• Arms cooperation following 2022 (Ukraine context)

The 2022–present period has seen renewed engagement:
• Putin–Kim summits
• Alleged arms transfers (DPRK artillery shells to Russia)
• Mutual diplomatic support
• Satellite technology cooperation

Korea remains a space where Russian interests intersect with American,
Chinese, Japanese, and Korean actors.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IX. CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Korea occupies a distinctive place in Russian memory.

Encoded meanings:
• Territory lost to Japan in 1905 defeat
• Zone of Soviet triumph in 1945
• Client state created and abandoned
• Space between great powers (China, Japan, US)
• Proof that buffer states cannot control their fate

Korea is remembered as **strategic object, not civilizational partner**—
a territory where Russian interests operate, not a civilization with
which Russia engages as peer.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
XI. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Buffer states attract great power competition.
• The power that cannot project force loses influence.
• Client states can outlive their patrons.
• Nuclear weapons transform dependency calculus.
• Geography makes Korean peninsula eternally contested.
• 1905 defeat excluded Russia from Korea for 40 years.
• 1945 victory created structures that persist today.

POLYPHONIC TENSIONS (v2.8):
• MERCOURIS: 1905 as miscalculation → different leadership possible
• MEARSHEIMER: 1905 as structural inevitability → continental power limits
• MERCOURIS: Korean War as Stalin's error → unintended consequences
• MEARSHEIMER: Korean War as structural success → partition preserved
• MERCOURIS: DPRK nuclear program as Russian failure → lost control
• MEARSHEIMER: DPRK nuclear program as rational self-help → predictable
• Both: Korea remains a managed problem, not a resolved issue

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.
