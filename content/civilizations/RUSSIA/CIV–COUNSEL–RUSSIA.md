This file learns from the present — analysing current events through
historically-grounded patterns to provide structured decision-relevant
options. It is informed by, but does not feed back into, CIV–SCHOLAR–RUSSIA,
which learns from the past.

Duty of Competence: This file is subject to a completeness standard.
The system's obligation is to surface all material options identifiable
through the application of three analytical perspectives: legitimacy
and institutional continuity; power distribution and structural
constraint; and leadership liability and mechanism. Failure to apply
any perspective constitutes a completeness violation.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
I. ENTITY IDENTIFICATION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Name: Russia / Russian Federation (Российская Федерация)
Classification: CIVILIZATION-STATE
Active: YES
Capital: Moscow
Current State Form: Federation (1991–present)

Russia is a civilization-state: a modern state that claims continuous
civilizational identity across multiple state forms. This claim shapes
both domestic legitimacy and foreign policy. Russia's self-conception
as a civilization — not merely a state — constrains what settlements
its leadership can accept and what narratives it can sustain.

Phase History:
1. Kievan Rus (c. 882–1240)
2. Mongol Period and Muscovite Rise (1240–1547)
3. Tsardom of Russia (1547–1721)
4. Russian Empire (1721–1917)
5. Soviet Union (1922–1991)
6. Russian Federation (1991–present)

Across all phases, several patterns persist:
• Central authority as the organizing principle of governance
• Buffer-zone obsession driven by geographic vulnerability
• Cyclical compression-rupture-regeneration under external pressure
• Tension between European orientation and Eurasian identity
• Endurance under adversity as both strategy and self-conception

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. SUCCESSION AND INHERITANCE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

INTERNAL SUCCESSION (Continuous Phases):
Kievan Rus → Muscovy → Tsardom → Empire → Soviet Union → Federation
Type: DIRECT_CONTINUATION across state-form changes.
The civilizational grammar persists through regime changes; each
successor state inherits the core patterns while adopting new
institutional forms.

EXTERNAL INHERITANCE:

From the Byzantine Empire:
  Type: IDEOLOGICAL_CLAIM
  Date: 1472 (marriage alliance with Sophia Palaiologina),
        1547 (Ivan IV adopts Tsar title)
  Inherited:
  • Third Rome doctrine (Moscow as successor to Constantinople)
  • Autocratic legitimacy model (ruler as God's representative)
  • Orthodox primacy claim (defender of the Orthodox world)
  • State-church symphony (mutual reinforcement of secular and
    religious authority)
  • Double-headed eagle (imperial symbolism)

From the Mongol Empire:
  Type: PARTIAL_ABSORPTION (during the Yoke period, 1240–1480)
  Inherited:
  • Centralized tribute and extraction governance
  • Communication and administrative systems
  • Autocratic submission culture (ruler's word as absolute law)
  • Deep strategic fear of steppe vulnerability and encirclement
  Source: MEM–RUSSIA–MONGOL–YOKE

CONTESTED CLAIMS:
• Ukraine claims Kievan Rus heritage independently of Russia.
  This is not merely a historical dispute; it directly affects
  Russian civilizational self-conception and the legitimacy of
  territorial claims. (Source: MEM–RUSSIA–KIEVAN–RUS)
• Belarus shares some heritage claims but with less contestation.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. STRATEGIC POSITION (THREE PERSPECTIVES)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

A) LEGITIMACY AND INSTITUTIONAL CONTINUITY
────────────────────────────────────────────

Russia's legitimacy structure is autocratic-civilizational: the
leader governs not merely as head of state but as guardian of a
civilizational mission. This structure has persisted across the
Tsardom, the Empire, the Soviet period, and the Federation. The
specific content of the mission changes — Orthodox defender, communist
vanguard, sovereign civilizational power — but the structure remains:
strong central authority justified by civilizational purpose.

Current legitimacy rests on three pillars:
• Sovereign independence from Western institutional frameworks
• Restoration of great-power status after the 1991 collapse
• Defence of Russian civilization against perceived external threats

Legitimacy is sustained symbolically — through historical narrative,
civilizational mission, and the image of a strong leader — but only
within strict structural limits. Symbolism cannot substitute for
economic performance, military capability, or elite cohesion. Myth
stabilises endurance but cannot create capacity.
(Source: CIV–DOCTRINE–RUSSIA, Doctrine 03)

Key legitimacy vulnerabilities:
• Any settlement frameable as defeat would undermine the strong-leader
  narrative that sustains domestic legitimacy
• Prolonged economic deterioration erodes the "restoration" narrative
• The gap between civilizational rhetoric and material reality creates
  a fragility that is invisible in normal times but acute under stress

Historical precedent: The Soviet Union collapsed not from military
defeat but from internal legitimacy failure — the regime could no
longer justify its own existence to its own population or its own
elites. Military capability remained; the will to use it evaporated.
(Source: MEM–RUSSIA–GORBACHEV, MEM–RUSSIA–USSR–COLD–WAR)

B) POWER DISTRIBUTION AND STRUCTURAL CONSTRAINT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Russia's geographic position defines its strategic constraints. The
North European Plain provides no natural barriers on the western
frontier; the country's enormous land mass creates multi-front
vulnerability; and access to warm-water ports (Black Sea, Baltic,
Pacific) remains a permanent strategic imperative.

Current power-distribution assessment:
• Nuclear arsenal intact and credible — ultimate guarantor of
  sovereignty
• Conventional military capability demonstrated but under sustained
  strain from prolonged operations
• Economic base narrowly dependent on hydrocarbon exports,
  constrained by sanctions
• Industrial replacement capacity under pressure — the critical
  question is whether production exceeds consumption over time
• Demographic trajectory unfavourable in the long term

Structural constraints:
• Endurance is Russia's primary strategic instrument — outlasting
  opponents who are more time-fragile. But endurance is only valid
  when: (a) the opponent is time-fragile, (b) replacement exceeds
  burn-rate, (c) elite cohesion holds, and (d) friction does not
  exceed mobilisation capacity. If any condition fails, endurance
  becomes self-consumption.
  (Source: CIV–CORE–RUSSIA, Prime Meta-Rule)
• Buffer zones on the western frontier are treated as non-negotiable
  by any Russian government — this is a structural imperative, not
  an ideological preference
• Energy leverage over Europe is declining but still present
• The China relationship provides economic support but creates
  dependency risk

Geographic imperatives (persistent across all state forms):
• Western frontier security (buffer zones, forward depth)
• Warm-water port access (Baltic, Black Sea, Pacific)
• Control of interior river corridors (Volga, Ob, Moskva systems)
• Avoidance of multi-front exposure

C) LEADERSHIP LIABILITY AND MECHANISM
────────────────────────────────────────

The current leadership bears significant personal exposure. In a
system where authority is personalist rather than institutional,
the leader's fate and the regime's fate are intertwined. This
creates specific incentive structures:

• The leadership cannot accept any outcome frameable as personal
  failure — because personal failure in a personalist system
  cascades into regime failure
• Elite cohesion is contingent on the perception that the leadership
  is succeeding. Prolonged stalemate erodes this perception; visible
  defeat would shatter it
• Defection incentives increase as the cost of loyalty rises.
  Historical precedent: the Soviet nomenklatura defected not from
  opposition to the system but from calculation that personal
  advantage lay in converting political capital into economic capital
  through the system's dissolution (1989–1993)
• The inner circle's personal stakes — financial exposure, legal
  liability, physical security — drive risk tolerance in ways that
  structural analysis alone cannot predict

Mechanism assessment:
• Autocracy sustains Russian state power only when buffered by
  institutions, ritual legitimacy, and administrative continuity.
  Unbuffered personalism amplifies short-term power but accelerates
  elite destruction and systemic failure.
  (Source: CIV–DOCTRINE–RUSSIA, Doctrine 02)
• Decision-quality distortion under personalist constraint:
  unbuffered personalism causes decisions to optimise for the
  leader's survival horizon rather than the state's structural
  interest. The divergence is invisible when leader and state
  interests align (early consolidation, external threat) and
  acute when they diverge (fiscal stress, partnership commitments,
  settlement negotiations). The divergence widens as fiscal
  constraint narrows the state's options while the leader's
  personal exposure remains fixed. This is the operational
  signature of unbuffered autocracy under resource constraint.
  Precedents: Peter overriding Panin-type restraint; Catherine
  overriding fiscal logic for Crimea; 1991 nomenklatura defecting
  when personal advantage exceeded institutional loyalty; June 2025
  Midnight Hammer response (leadership chose US relationship over
  Iran partnership commitment).
  (Source: Decision Points Sessions 001–002, February 2026;
  CIV–DOCTRINE–RUSSIA, Doctrine 02)
• Russia consistently produces more elites than its political economy
  can absorb. Stability requires subordinating elite claims to
  survival imperatives through war or emergency. Prolonged peace
  without external threat triggers elite overproduction and
  fragmentation.
  (Source: CIV–DOCTRINE–RUSSIA, Doctrine 04)

TENSIONS BETWEEN PERSPECTIVES (preserved, not resolved):

The three perspectives produce genuinely different assessments:

1. Legitimacy vs Power: The legitimacy perspective says Russia cannot
   accept any settlement that undermines civilizational self-conception.
   The power perspective says Russia must accept settlements that
   reflect actual power distribution, regardless of narrative. These
   constraints are in direct tension — and the leadership must navigate
   both simultaneously.

2. Power vs Liability: The power perspective treats the state as the
   unit of analysis — Russia's capabilities, Russia's position. The
   liability perspective treats the leadership as the unit — personal
   exposure, defection incentives, inner-circle dynamics. These can
   diverge: what is rational for the state may not be rational for the
   leadership, and vice versa.
   Diagnostic: When this divergence is active, the revealed preference
   hierarchy applies — what the leadership actually chose under
   analogous constraint is the strongest predictor of what it will
   choose now. Structural logic and legitimacy analysis remain
   valuable for framing options but are subordinate to revealed
   preference for prediction in personalist systems.
   (Source: Decision Points Sessions 001–002; see Section VII,
   Pattern: Revealed Preference Under Analogous Constraint)

3. Legitimacy vs Liability: The legitimacy perspective sees governance
   through civilizational continuity — institutions outlast leaders.
   The liability perspective sees governance through personal stakes —
   this leader, this inner circle, these specific exposure points.
   When leadership transition approaches, this tension becomes acute.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. MATERIAL OPTIONS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

OPTION A: Endurance Through Attrition

  Grounded in: Power distribution and structural constraint

  Reasoning: Russia's historical pattern is to outlast opponents who
  are more time-fragile. If the current leadership can maintain
  replacement capacity above burn-rate, hold elite cohesion, and
  sustain the domestic narrative, time favours the side with greater
  tolerance for cost. Western democratic systems face electoral cycles
  and public attention limits that Russia's authoritarian structure
  does not.

  Key Assumptions:
  • Industrial replacement exceeds operational consumption — Linchpin: YES
  • Elite cohesion holds under sustained economic pressure — Linchpin: YES
  • Western support for Ukraine is time-fragile — Linchpin: YES
  • Demographic constraints do not bind within the relevant time horizon
    — Linchpin: NO
  • Sanctions impact remains manageable through alternative partnerships
    — Linchpin: NO

  Confidence: MODERATE-HIGH (upgraded from MODERATE — February 2026)
  Assessed against structural constraints and five historical precedents
  (1812, 1905, 1917, 1941, 1991). Binding constraint (REFRAMED):
  the relative degradation rate — does Ukraine's capacity (manpower,
  morale, Western support) degrade faster than Russia's fiscal base?
  If yes, the attrition thesis produces a military outcome within the
  fiscal window. If no, Russia exhausts its reserves before achieving
  a decision. See Section VI-B (Opponent Constraint Assessment) for
  the opponent's binding constraints and discriminating signals.
  Previous framing (replacement vs. consumption) remains valid as a
  sub-constraint but is insufficient alone — it tracks only Russia's
  side of the attrition race.

  Risks: If replacement falls below burn-rate, endurance becomes
  self-consumption. If elite cohesion fractures under prolonged
  pressure, the personalist system has no institutional buffer to
  absorb the shock. The 1991 precedent shows that endurance narratives
  can collapse suddenly when internal legitimacy fails.

  Conditions for success: Opponent fatigue manifests in reduced support;
  replacement pipeline holds; sanctions are partially circumvented;
  domestic narrative remains credible.

  Conditions for failure: Industrial bottlenecks emerge (machine tools,
  electronics, workforce); elite defection signals appear; economic
  deterioration outpaces narrative control; opponent consolidates
  long-term commitment.

  Discriminating evidence:
  • Watch for: Industrial output data, defence procurement rates,
    elite travel and asset-movement patterns
  • Signal of failure: Senior officials moving assets offshore;
    replacement orders exceeding production capacity

  EVIDENCE UPDATE 1 (February 2026 — Abu Dhabi / fiscal signals):
  Russia's 2026 budget includes the first reduction in defence funding
  since the invasion began. Oil and gas revenues have declined over 25%
  under the combined effect of sanctions, rouble dynamics, and falling
  export prices. The budget is projected to run a deficit, and government
  reserves are shrinking. This is the first concrete baseline reading on
  Option A's binding constraint (replacement rate vs consumption). The
  direction is unfavourable for the endurance thesis — but it is not yet
  clear that production has fallen below consumption. Budget pressure
  constrains the rate of replacement without yet demonstrating that the
  threshold has been crossed.
  Direction: UNFAVOURABLE. Binding constraint under strain, not yet
  falsified.
  Sources: OSW Commentary (Dec 2025); NEST Centre analysis (2026);
  CSIS sanctions assessment; CNA war economy report.

  EVIDENCE UPDATE 2 (February 2026 — defence production / labour):
  Production data provides a more granular reading of the binding
  constraint. Near-term output remains substantial: planned 2025
  targets include 250 T-90M tanks, 1,100 infantry fighting vehicles,
  approximately 2,500 precision-guided missiles per year, and an
  estimated 250,000 artillery shells per month. These figures suggest
  that replacement currently meets or exceeds consumption in most
  categories.
  However, a structural ceiling is visible. Soviet-era stockpiles —
  which have supplemented new production since 2022 — are projected
  to be largely exhausted by mid-2025 if combat intensity continues
  at current levels. After that point, Russia becomes entirely
  dependent on new manufacturing. The defence sector faces a labour
  deficit of approximately 160,000 workers, with the broader
  manufacturing economy short 1.9 million. The workforce is aging
  (16-18% over 60), skilled specialists are scarce, and defence
  hiring is poaching from civilian sectors — compounding broader
  economic strain.
  This means the binding constraint has a time dimension that was
  not previously visible: near-term replacement appears adequate,
  but the structural capacity to sustain current rates is constrained
  by labour, stockpile depletion, and fiscal pressure acting
  simultaneously. The endurance thesis holds in the near term but
  faces a convergence of constraints in the medium term (12-24
  months).
  Direction: MIXED. Near-term adequate; medium-term ceiling real.
  Binding constraint not falsified but has a visible horizon.
  Sources: EchoWarfare intelligence assessment (2025); Finabel
  comparative analysis (2025); Economist (May 2025); CEPA (2025);
  Jamestown Foundation; Reuters (Nov 2024).

  EVIDENCE UPDATE 3 (February 2026 — new instruments assessment):
  Four new instruments have emerged since 1 January 2026, all of
  which strengthen Option A's near-term viability:
  (1) Trump personal-diplomacy channel — reduces Western political
  pressure, buys time; but creates June deadline expectation.
  (2) Board of Peace proposal — provides diplomatic cover for
  continued endurance without structural concessions.
  (3) Reversible energy infrastructure pause — demonstrates
  cooperation to Trump at zero structural cost; strengthens
  the favourable diplomatic configuration.
  (4) Sumy buffer zone — this WEAKENS Option A by requiring forces
  that the labour deficit and stockpile depletion cannot support.
  Net: three instruments extend the near-term runway; one
  accelerates the medium-term binding constraint. The medium-term
  ceiling (12-24 months) is unchanged — new instruments mask the
  constraint without resolving it.
  CONCENTRATION RISK: All three favourable instruments depend on
  the Trump relationship. If that relationship fails (attention
  shift, policy reversal, June deadline breach), all three
  deteriorate simultaneously and Option A reverts to its pre-
  January structural trajectory — unfavourable and time-limited.
  Direction: STRENGTHENED NEAR-TERM; UNCHANGED MEDIUM-TERM.
  Binding constraint masked, not resolved.
  Sources: Decision Points Session 003 (retrospective Jan 1 2026).

  EVIDENCE UPDATE 4 (February 2026 — 2026 budget data):
  The 2026 defence budget is 12.6 trillion roubles, down from
  13.5 trillion in 2025 — the first cut since the war began.
  However, security forces funding rises (3.5T → 3.9T) and
  state propaganda spending increases 1.5 times, indicating
  repackaging rather than genuine fiscal adjustment. Military
  compensation for the deceased and wounded cut from 78 billion
  to 58 billion roubles. The 2025 federal deficit hit a record
  5.65 trillion roubles; 2026 projected at 3.8 trillion. VAT
  increase from 20% to 22% proposed.
  Assessment: The fiscal constraint is STEEPENING — the deficit
  is structural, not cyclical. But the repackaging pattern confirms
  the revealed-preference hierarchy prediction: the leadership
  defers genuine adjustment and manages the headline. Deferral
  buffers (NWF drawdown, debt capacity at ~20% of GDP, VAT
  increase) remain available but are being consumed. The binding
  constraint is not yet crossed but the buffer runway is shorter
  than at the start of 2025.
  Relative degradation assessment unchanged: Ukraine's manpower
  curve remains steeper than Russia's fiscal curve. No identified
  mechanism reverses this by Q2 2026. The advance rate is the
  discriminating variable — fiscal strain with territorial
  progress sustains the endurance thesis; fiscal strain without
  progress breaks it.
  Direction: UNFAVOURABLE AND STEEPENING. Binding constraint
  approaching but not yet crossed; deferral buffers shrinking.

  documents; ISW analysis; Moscow Times (Jan 2026).

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

OPTION B: Negotiated Settlement With Minimum Viable Gains

  Grounded in: Legitimacy and institutional continuity

  Reasoning: Russian legitimacy requires that any settlement be
  domestically frameable as non-defeat. The leadership does not need
  total victory; it needs a narrative of sufficient achievement —
  territorial recognition, security guarantees, or institutional
  acknowledgment — to sustain the strong-leader image. Historical
  pattern: Russian leaders have accepted partial outcomes when they
  could be framed as strategic success (e.g. Catherine's restraint
  preference under fiscal constraint; Alexander II's post-Crimean
  reforms).

  Key Assumptions:
  • A settlement formula exists that both sides can accept — Linchpin: YES
  • The leadership can domestically frame partial gains as success
    — Linchpin: YES
  • Western interlocutors are willing to negotiate rather than
    insist on full restoration — Linchpin: YES
  • Territorial recognition (of some gains) is on the table
    — Linchpin: NO

  Confidence: LOW
  Assessed against legitimacy constraints on both sides and three
  historical precedents (post-Crimean reforms 1856, Brest-Litovsk 1918,
  Catherine's fiscal restraint preference). Binding constraint: whether
  a settlement formula exists that both sides' legitimacy constraints
  can absorb — the structural gap is currently very wide, and this
  condition is not met. Included because settlement is always a material
  option; its omission would constitute a completeness violation.

  Risks: Premature settlement may be perceived domestically as
  weakness, triggering the legitimacy crisis it was designed to
  avoid. Externally, partial settlement may freeze conflict rather
  than resolve it, creating conditions for future escalation.

  Conditions for success: Both sides face simultaneously increasing
  costs; a mediator with credibility to both parties emerges; domestic
  narratives on both sides can absorb compromise.

  Conditions for failure: Either side believes time favours continued
  conflict; maximalist positions harden; leadership faces internal
  pressure against concession.

  Discriminating evidence:
  • Watch for: Back-channel diplomatic contacts; shifts in public
    rhetoric from maximalist to conditional framing
  • Signal of failure: Escalatory actions inconsistent with settlement
    preparation; public commitments that foreclose negotiating space

  EVIDENCE UPDATE (February 2026):
  The first trilateral talks between Russia, Ukraine, and the United
  States took place in Abu Dhabi on 24-25 January 2026 — the first
  such direct engagement since the 2022 invasion. Both sides described
  talks as "constructive." A second round was scheduled for 1 February.
  This is the first direct test of Option B's binding constraint (does
  a mutually acceptable settlement formula exist?). The evidence is
  mixed: territorial demands remain the principal obstacle, with Russia
  occupying approximately 20% of Ukrainian territory and showing no
  willingness to revise its positions on neutrality or territorial
  control. The Kremlin cautioned against expecting "significant results
  from initial contacts." However, the format itself — trilateral, with
  US mediation — is new and represents a structural change in the
  diplomatic landscape.
  Simultaneously, Russia launched its largest aerial attack of 2026
  and deployed the Oreshnik intermediate-range ballistic missile against
  western Ukraine. Escalation alongside negotiation is consistent with
  a "negotiate from strength" posture, not a settlement posture — but
  it does not foreclose settlement.
  Direction: SLIGHTLY MORE PLAUSIBLE than before, but binding constraint
  still not met. The gap between positions remains very wide.

  (Abu Dhabi); Kremlin press statement.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

OPTION C: Strategic Diversification and Reorientation

  Grounded in: Leadership liability and mechanism

  Reasoning: As the cost of the current course rises, the leadership's
  personal exposure increases. Diversification — building alternative
  partnerships, reducing dependency on any single relationship or
  conflict outcome, creating economic alternatives to Western markets
  — reduces the concentration of risk. The leadership's survival
  instinct favours hedging. Historical pattern: Russian leaders
  reorient when the cost-benefit calculation shifts decisively (e.g.
  Gorbachev's glasnost was, in part, a survival pivot).

  Key Assumptions:
  • Alternative partnerships (China, India, Global South) can partially
    substitute for Western economic relationships — Linchpin: YES
  • The leadership can reframe reorientation as strategic choice rather
    than forced retreat — Linchpin: YES
  • Chinese willingness to absorb Russia's economic dependency has
    limits — Linchpin: NO
  • Arctic economic development provides medium-term alternative
    revenue — Linchpin: NO

  Confidence: MODERATE
  Assessed against current trade reorientation data and two historical
  precedents (Gorbachev's pivot 1985–1991, Peter's European reorientation
  1697–1703). Binding constraint: absorption capacity of alternative
  economic partners, particularly China — Russia cannot control whether
  Beijing absorbs its economic weight at favourable terms.

  Risks: Reorientation toward China creates a new dependency that
  may prove more constraining than the Western relationship it
  replaces. Diversification takes time that the current situation
  may not allow. Partners may extract significant concessions from
  Russia's weakened bargaining position.

  Conditions for success: Multiple partnerships reduce dependency
  on any single relationship; energy exports find durable alternative
  markets; sanctions circumvention stabilises the economic base;
  narrative frames the pivot as multipolarity, not retreat.

  Conditions for failure: China extracts asymmetric concessions;
  alternative markets cannot absorb Russian exports at comparable
  volume; diversification pace lags behind economic deterioration.

  Discriminating evidence:
  • Watch for: Trade volume shifts (Russia-China vs Russia-EU);
    Sino-Russian diplomatic language (partner vs patron framing);
    new infrastructure projects (Arctic, Central Asian corridors)
  • Signal of failure: Russia accepting visibly unfavourable terms
    from China; continued dependence on single-commodity exports

  EVIDENCE UPDATE (February 2026 — China absorption / trade plateau):
  Russia-China bilateral trade declined 6.9% in 2025 to $228.1
  billion, down from a record $244.8 billion in 2024. The decline
  is structural, not political: the post-sanctions expansion model
  (discounted energy, emergency substitution of Western imports,
  Chinese vehicle and machinery exports) has reached a "structural
  plateau" — its growth momentum largely exhausted by 2024.
  Crucially, the decline was driven by Chinese demand dynamics,
  not Russian supply choices. Crude oil imports from Russia fell
  19.6% in value; Chinese car imports from Russia dropped 61%;
  supplies of heavy distillates, coal, and LNG all decreased amid
  declining Chinese demand. This is evidence that China's absorption
  capacity — the binding constraint — has limits, and those limits
  are now visible.
  The asymmetric dependency is deepening. Russia has grown
  progressively more dependent on Beijing, which leverages this
  imbalance. China adjusts its support when it would entail
  substantial economic costs — meaning absorption is conditional,
  not guaranteed. Payment infrastructure remains fragile: Chinese
  banks restrict transactions due to secondary sanctions risk,
  commissions run as high as 12%, and trade increasingly relies
  on workarounds (border-region banks, netting systems,
  cryptocurrency) that are vulnerable to further sanctions pressure.
  This is the specific failure signal identified in v1.1:
  alternative markets unable to absorb Russian exports at comparable
  volume, with China extracting asymmetric concessions. The signal
  is not yet decisive — $228 billion in bilateral trade is still
  substantial — but the direction is clear.
  Direction: UNFAVOURABLE. Binding constraint showing its limits.
  Confidence direction: trending toward LOW (from MODERATE).

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

OPTION D: Escalation to Force a Decision

  Grounded in: Power distribution and structural constraint;
  leadership liability and mechanism

  Reasoning: If the leadership calculates that time is not favourable
  (contrary to the endurance thesis), escalation — conventional,
  economic, or nuclear signalling — could force a decision before
  the unfavourable trends compound. Escalation is rational when the
  cost of continued stalemate exceeds the cost of escalation risk.
  Historical pattern: Russia has historically escalated when it
  perceived closing windows of opportunity (e.g. 1939 Winter War;
  the initial 2022 escalation itself).

  Key Assumptions:
  • Escalation produces opponent concession rather than opponent
    escalation — Linchpin: YES
  • Nuclear signalling deters rather than provokes — Linchpin: YES
  • The leadership's risk tolerance is higher than the opponent's
    — Linchpin: NO
  • Conventional escalation capability exists beyond current
    commitment — Linchpin: NO

  Confidence: LOW
  Assessed against escalation dynamics and three historical precedents
  (Winter War 1939, Cuban Missile Crisis 1962, initial 2022 escalation).
  Binding constraint: opponent response — whether escalation produces
  concession or counter-escalation is entirely outside Russian control
  and resolves within days. Included because both the power and liability
  perspectives identify this path as plausible with catastrophic
  consequences; its omission would leave the decision-maker blind.

  Risks: Escalation may provoke the opposite of intended effect —
  coalition hardening, expanded opposition, or uncontrollable
  escalation spirals. Nuclear signalling carries existential risk.
  Conventional escalation may exceed available capability.

  Conditions for success: Opponent risk tolerance is lower than
  Russia's; escalation produces negotiating space rather than
  counter-escalation; nuclear signalling is interpreted as intended
  (deterrent, not provocative).

  Conditions for failure: Opponent matches or exceeds escalation;
  coalition expands; nuclear signalling triggers security guarantees
  rather than concession; escalation exceeds conventional capacity.

  Discriminating evidence:
  • Watch for: Changes in nuclear posture or doctrine statements;
    reserve mobilisation signals; diplomatic ultimatum framing
  • Signal of failure: Coalition military commitments expanding
    in response to Russian escalation signals

  EVIDENCE UPDATE (February 2026):
  Russia deployed the Oreshnik intermediate-range ballistic missile
  against western Ukraine in early 2026 and launched its largest
  coordinated aerial attack of the year — both occurring alongside
  the Abu Dhabi trilateral talks. This constitutes a form of limited
  escalation. The opponent response has been coalition hardening, not
  concession: France and the United Kingdom signalled readiness to
  contribute troops to a multinational peacekeeping force, with the UK
  allocating £200 million for potential deployment preparation.
  This is negative discriminating evidence for Option D. Escalation
  is producing the opposite of its intended effect (coalition expansion
  rather than concession), which directly tests the binding constraint
  (does escalation produce opponent concession or counter-escalation?).
  The evidence so far points toward counter-escalation.
  Direction: UNFAVOURABLE. Binding constraint trending toward
  falsification. Coalition military commitments expanding in direct
  response to escalation signals — this is the specific failure signal
  identified in v1.1.

VI. STABILITY INDICATORS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Assessment of internal legitimacy stress signals.

When internal stress is elevated, the legitimacy and institutional
continuity perspective carries elevated analytical weight — because
during internal stress, a gap opens between what the state can do
(capabilities) and what the state will do (willingness to deploy them).

| Indicator | Status | Assessment |
|-----------|--------|------------|
| Ideological coherence | STABLE | Civilizational-sovereign narrative is functioning; no visible internal challenge to the regime's self-justification. The willingness to enter trilateral talks has not disrupted the domestic narrative — the leadership controls the framing. |
| Elite cohesion | STRESSED | Cohesion holds while success narrative is maintained; prolonged stalemate increases defection calculation pressure. The first defence budget reduction since the invasion is a potential stress signal — if elites connected to the defence sector perceive declining resource allocation, defection calculation shifts. Not yet visible, but the structural condition for it has changed. |
| Popular legitimacy | STABLE | Domestic support sustained through narrative control and war framing; economic deterioration is the primary risk. Budget deficit and declining reserves have not yet translated into visible public discontent, but the fiscal trajectory is unfavourable. |
| Institutional function | STRESSED | Wartime strain on institutional capacity; mobilisation and economic adaptation create friction. The 2026 budget deficit, shrinking reserves, and 25%+ revenue decline from oil and gas exports compound institutional strain. Financing continued operations at current tempo becomes structurally more difficult. |
| Narrative control | STABLE | Information environment remains largely controlled domestically; the Abu Dhabi talks have been framed domestically as Russia negotiating from a position of strength. Simultaneous military escalation reinforces this framing. External narrative contested but not regime-threatening. |

Current assessment: 2 of 5 indicators STRESSED; none CRITICAL.
Legitimacy perspective carries standard (not elevated) weight.
Direction: Institutional function trending toward elevated strain;
elite cohesion stable but underlying conditions have shifted
unfavourably with the first defence budget reduction.

Threshold watch: Elite cohesion is the leading indicator. If elite
cohesion moves to CRITICAL, the liability and mechanism perspective
becomes the primary predictive frame — because personalist systems
fail through elite defection before they fail through popular revolt.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI-B. OPPONENT CONSTRAINT ASSESSMENT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Assessment of the principal opponent's binding constraints.
Required for any Material Option whose success depends on the
opponent's capacity degrading relative to the entity's own
constraints. Without this section, the power perspective is
applied to one side only — which is a structural analysis error.

OPPONENT: Ukraine / Ukrainian Armed Forces

BINDING CONSTRAINT 1: Manpower
  Status: BINDING NOW
  Evidence (February 2026):
  • Brigades operating at 50-60% capacity
  • 2 million draft evaders; 200,000 AWOL (new defence minister's
    public acknowledgment, January 2026)
  • Average soldier age: 40
  • Rotation cycles extended from 3 days to 38 days on the line
  • Systemic desertion: "Everybody is tired. The mood has changed"
    (Guardian, January 2025); one company-level testimony: "almost
    no one left except the injured; the others are dead" (BBC)
  • Mobilisation system increasingly coercive; resistance growing
  Assessment: This constraint is binding in real time. Manpower
  is not a medium-term ceiling (like Russia's fiscal constraint);
  it is an active, current limitation on Ukraine's capacity to
  hold the front. No amount of Western equipment compensates for
  infantry shortages — drones suppress, but soldiers hold ground.
  Sources: Business Insider (Jan 2026, Fedorov interview); Kyiv
  Independent (2026 analysis); Guardian (Jan 2025); BBC; Tactics
  Institute analysis.

BINDING CONSTRAINT 2: Western support trajectory
  Status: DETERIORATING
  Evidence (February 2026):
  • US USAI allocation: $400 million (2026), down from $14 billion
    (April 2024) — 97% reduction
  • Trump administration explicitly de-escalating through diplomacy,
    not sustained military commitment
  • European compensation: Germany €11.5B, Norway $7B, EU €90B
    concessional loans (2026-2027). Substantial but primarily
    equipment and financial — does not solve the manpower problem
  • Congressional oversight provisions (48-hour reporting on
    intelligence restriction) suggest institutional resistance to
    full withdrawal, but executive direction is clear
  Assessment: US support is in structural decline under the current
  administration. European compensation is real but partial — it
  covers equipment, not manpower, and the pipeline operates on a
  slower timeline than US drawdown authority. The support trajectory
  is DETERIORATING but not collapsing; a sudden cutoff is unlikely
  given congressional protections, but the trend is unambiguous.
  Sources: Shafaq News (2026 USAI figures); Economic Times; Atlantic
  Council (defence bill analysis); Frontliner.ua (2026 aid overview).

BINDING CONSTRAINT 3: Morale and social cohesion
  Status: STRESSED TO CRITICAL
  Evidence (February 2026):
  • Desertion crisis publicly acknowledged by military leadership
  • Frontline soldiers describing exhaustion and mood change as
    systemic, not individual
  • Extended deployments (38 days) without adequate rest or rotation
  • Draft resistance growing across society; recruitment increasingly
    coercive
  • New defence minister promising audit and reform — implicitly
    acknowledging systemic failure
  Assessment: Morale degradation is non-linear. Armies in attrition
  warfare do not degrade linearly — they hold, and then they break.
  The current signals (systemic desertion, public acknowledgment,
  extended rotations, coercive mobilisation) are the signals that
  precede non-linear degradation. The historical parallel from
  Russia's own experience: the Imperial Russian Army in 1917 did
  not run out of equipment; it ran out of willingness. This
  pattern can apply to the opponent.
  Sources: Guardian (Jan 2025, desertion crisis); BBC (frontline
  exhaustion); Reuters (combat conditions); Guardian photo essay
  (Jan 2026, rotation cycles).

RELATIVE DEGRADATION ASSESSMENT:
  Russia's primary binding constraint (fiscal base) is projected
  to bind within 12-18 months (NWF liquid assets potentially
  exhausted by year-end 2026; oil revenue 24% below 2025 levels).
  Ukraine's primary binding constraint (manpower) is binding NOW.
  The attrition race is between these two curves. If Ukrainian
  capacity degrades non-linearly (morale break, cascade from
  localised breakthroughs, desertion acceleration) before Russia's
  fiscal base is exhausted, the "win on the battlefield" variant
  of Option A becomes a real outcome, not just a narrative.
  Current assessment: Ukraine's curve is steeper. Russia's fiscal
  constraint is masked by new instruments (Trump channel, Board
  of Peace, energy pause); Ukraine's manpower constraint has no
  equivalent masking instrument.

DISCRIMINATING SIGNALS — which curve is winning:
  Russia's fiscal curve:
  • NWF liquid asset level (monthly reporting)
  • Oil price trajectory (Urals crude vs. budget assumption)
  • Secondary sanctions activation (would accelerate depletion)
  • Defence production output vs. targets (actual, not planned)

  Ukraine's manpower curve:
  • Brigade strength percentages (if reported or estimated)
  • Desertion/AWOL rates (public acknowledgment = lagging indicator)
  • Rotation cycle length (extending = worsening)
  • Territorial loss rate (acceleration = capacity degrading)
  • Mobilisation law changes (more coercive = more desperate)
  • Western military assessment language (shift from "can hold"
    to "under pressure" to "unsustainable")

  Crossover indicator: If Russia's territorial advance rate
  accelerates while its fiscal drawdown continues at current
  pace, that suggests Ukraine's curve is breaking faster.
  If advance rate stalls while fiscal drawdown accelerates,
  Russia's curve is losing.

VII. DECISION-RELEVANT HISTORY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Historical patterns with current relevance, drawn from the Russia
civilizational memory corpus.

PATTERN: Endurance Through Compression
  Activation: HIGH (with medium-term structural ceiling — Feb 2026)
  Source: MEM–RUSSIA–MONGOL–YOKE, MEM–RUSSIA–WWII–SIEGE–LENINGRAD,
          MEM–RUSSIA–WAR–GREAT–PATRIOTIC series
  Relevance: Russia's historical pattern of absorbing pressure and
  outlasting opponents is currently active. The critical constraint
  is that compression fails when elite cohesion fractures or when
  replacement falls below burn-rate. The pattern succeeded in 1812
  and 1941–45; it failed in 1905 and 1917 (when military strain
  triggered domestic revolution) and in 1991 (when internal
  legitimacy collapsed despite intact military capability).
  Update: Defence production data shows near-term replacement is
  being maintained (250 tanks, 1,100 IFVs, ~2,500 missiles/year,
  250k shells/month planned). However, Soviet-era stockpiles are
  projected to be largely exhausted by mid-2025, after which Russia
  depends entirely on new manufacturing — and the defence sector
  faces a 160,000-worker deficit with an aging workforce. The
  endurance pattern's historical lesson applies: it works until the
  replacement-consumption equation inverts, and the structural
  conditions for that inversion are now visible on a 12-24 month
  horizon.

PATTERN: Buffer Zone Imperative
  Activation: HIGH
  Source: MEM–RUSSIA–PETER–GREAT, MEM–RUSSIA–PETERSBURG,
          MEM–RUSSIA–GEO series (Baltic, Black Sea, Caucasus)
  Relevance: The western frontier has no natural barriers. Every
  Russian government since Muscovy has treated buffer zones as
  non-negotiable. The current conflict is, in structural terms,
  a buffer-zone dispute — and historical precedent suggests that
  no Russian government will voluntarily relinquish claimed buffer
  territory unless compelled by superior force.

PATTERN: Temporal Compression as Governance
  Activation: MODERATE
  Source: MEM–RUSSIA–IVAN–IV, MEM–RUSSIA–STALIN, MEM–RUSSIA–PUTIN
  Relevance: Russian authority has historically stabilised by
  shortening decision intervals. Peace extends time and enables
  elite bargaining; emergency compresses time and subordinates
  legitimacy to usefulness. The current conflict serves a governance
  function beyond its military objectives — it compresses the
  political space in which elite challenges can form.

PATTERN: Fiscal Constraint and Restraint Preference
  Activation: HIGH (upgraded from MODERATE — February 2026)
  Source: MEM–RUSSIA–PANIN, MEM–RUSSIA–CATHERINE–GREAT
  Relevance: When per capita extraction is low and war costs
  consume a large share of revenue, alliance-based restraint is
  structurally favoured over unilateral conquest. This pattern
  suggests that prolonged high-cost conflict creates structural
  pressure toward diplomatic resolution — but only when the
  fiscal burden becomes unsustainable, and only when conquest
  does not promise clear fiscal returns.
  Update: Russia's 2026 budget includes the first defence funding
  reduction since the invasion, combined with a 25%+ drop in
  hydrocarbon revenue and a projected deficit. This moves the
  fiscal constraint pattern from moderate to high activation.
  The Catherine-era precedent is directly relevant: fiscal exhaustion
  creates structural pressure toward negotiation even when the
  leadership's narrative demands continued strength. The Abu Dhabi
  talks may be partly explained by this fiscal dynamic.

PATTERN: Fiscal-Temporal Compression Trap
  Activation: HIGH (February 2026)
  Source: Decision Points Sessions 001–002; MEM–RUSSIA–PANIN,
          MEM–RUSSIA–CATHERINE–GREAT; CIV–DOCTRINE–RUSSIA
          Doctrines 01, 05
  Relevance: Fiscal constraint demands more time (resources running
  out; the state needs to slow the burn). Temporal compression
  demands less time (the governance model requires emergency to
  suppress elite bargaining). When both pressures act simultaneously,
  the system enters a specific trap: it cannot slow down (peace
  destabilises) and cannot speed up (the fiscal base does not
  support acceleration). The current configuration exhibits this
  trap — the 2026 budget reduction signals fiscal constraint while
  the wartime governance model depends on sustained emergency.
  The leadership is caught between a fiscal trajectory that demands
  adjustment and a governance model that requires tempo.

PATTERN: Revealed Preference Under Analogous Constraint
  Activation: HIGH (February 2026) — VALIDATED
  Source: Decision Points Sessions 002–003; Operation Midnight Hammer
          (June 2025); MEM–RUSSIA–GORBACHEV
  Relevance: When this leadership has faced a structurally analogous
  decision before, what it actually chose is a stronger predictor
  of future behaviour than structural logic or legitimacy analysis.
  Russia's response to Midnight Hammer (June 2025) — verbal
  condemnation without hardware transfer, explicit compartmentalisation
  of the US relationship — is the baseline predictor for how the
  leadership will handle the current Iran defence decision. The
  pattern: personalist systems under pressure resolve structural-
  versus-personal divergence in favour of personal survival.
  Diagnostic hierarchy for personalist systems: revealed preference
  > structural logic > legitimacy analysis.
  VALIDATION (Session 003, retrospective Jan 1 2026): The hierarchy
  was tested against three decision points the leadership faced at
  the turn of the year. On the two decisions where the three
  analytical perspectives diverged (Oreshnik pricing, fiscal shock
  response), the liability/personal-survival prediction matched the
  actual outcome both times. Structural logic was partially
  accommodated but subordinated; legitimacy was partially sacrificed.
  The one decision where all three perspectives converged (Abu Dhabi
  engagement) was overdetermined and untestable. The hierarchy holds:
  liability > structural > legitimacy. This is now the strongest
  predictive tool in the COUNSEL framework for this leadership.

PATTERN: Partnership Credibility Decay
  Activation: MODERATE (February 2026)
  Source: Decision Points Session 002; Midnight Hammer precedent;
          Soviet loss of Egypt (1970s Sadat pivot)
  Relevance: Personalist systems systematically under-deliver on
  alliance commitments because the leader's survival horizon is
  shorter than the alliance's required commitment horizon. Each
  iteration degrades credibility with accelerating damage. Russia's
  response to Midnight Hammer (words without hardware despite a
  five-month-old strategic partnership treaty) is the first data
  point. A second floor-level response to a US strike on Iran
  would confirm the pattern and effectively end the partnership's
  operational content. Historical parallel: the Soviet loss of
  Egypt followed a similar trajectory — Moscow's support was
  calibrated to Soviet survival needs, not Egyptian security needs,
  and Sadat pivoted to the US. Implication: Russia's partnership
  value proposition (to Iran, India, Turkey, and others) is under
  structural pressure from the personalist decision-quality
  distortion documented above.

PATTERN: Engage to Outlast
  Activation: HIGH (February 2026)
  Source: Decision Points Session 006; MEM–RUSSIA–NICHOLAS–II
          (Duma precedent); MEM–RUSSIA–CONGRESS–VIENNA; MEM–RUSSIA–
          PANIN
  Relevance: Diplomatic performance without structural commitment
  as a distinct strategic mode. The leadership enters diplomatic
  processes (Istanbul talks, Abu Dhabi trilateral), exchanges road
  maps, signals willingness — while actual positions remain
  unchanged. The Nicholas II Duma precedent (1905): "reform
  conceded tactically, not integrated structurally," producing "a
  legitimacy half-life rather than renewal." Validated across three
  simultaneous decision points (budget repackaging, June deadline
  participation without positional movement, Alekseyev diplomatic
  instrumentalisation).
  Discriminating signals for transition:
  C→A (genuine engagement): territorial flexibility language,
    delegation upgrade to principals, fiscal demobilisation signals,
    ceasefire offer with specific terms.
  C→B (open defiance): major offensive timed to diplomatic window,
    third Oreshnik deployment, explicit rejection of June timeline,
    Trump relationship rupture.
  Binding question: not what the leadership chooses but what forces
  a transition. Fiscal curve failure forces A; battlefield
  breakthrough forces B.
  Cross-entity reinforcement: Trump's revealed preferences (process
  over outcome, avoid new costs, personal relationship as channel,
  domestic calendar governs November 2026 midterms) converge with
  Option C. The June deadline is a shared performance, not a forcing
  function.
  Historical pattern: Russia accepts externally-imposed deadlines
  only after military defeat (1856 Paris, 1905 Portsmouth). From
  a contested but favourable position, external timelines are
  absorbed. The June deadline lacks the forcing mechanism that
  made Paris and Portsmouth binding.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VIII. CROSS-ENTITY LINKS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

CHINA:
  Dimension: Autocracy models; economic dependency
  Key distinction: Russian autocracy is personalist; Chinese is
  institutional. Russian autocracy can collapse with the leader;
  Chinese survives transitions. Implication: different pressure
  points, different vulnerability windows.
  Update (February 2026): The economic dimension has become
  primary. Russia-China trade declined 6.9% in 2025 after four
  years of growth, revealing a structural plateau in China's
  absorption capacity. The dependency is asymmetric and deepening:
  Russia needs China more than China needs Russia, and Beijing
  leverages this. Payment infrastructure remains fragile under
  sanctions pressure. The autocracy-model distinction now has a
  concrete economic implication: China's institutional autocracy
  can calibrate its support to Russia based on cost-benefit
  calculation; Russia's personalist autocracy cannot easily
  diversify away from the dependency it has created.

UNITED STATES:
  Dimension: Strategic competition; trilateral mediator
  Key distinction: US strategic attention is constrained by
  electoral cycles and public opinion; Russian strategic attention
  is constrained by economic capacity and elite cohesion. Each
  side's vulnerability is the other's time horizon.
  Update (February 2026): The US has entered the trilateral format
  as an active mediator (Abu Dhabi, January 2026). This is a
  structural shift — the US is now a party to the negotiating
  process, not merely a support provider. The Trump administration's
  envoy framing ("dedicated to bringing peace") introduces a new
  variable: domestic US political incentive to produce a result,
  which may increase pressure on both sides. The time-fragility
  dynamic cuts both ways — the US electoral incentive may accelerate
  the timeline, but may also produce pressure for a deal that neither
  Russia nor Ukraine finds structurally stable.
  Update 2 (February 2026 — Trump revealed preferences on June
  deadline): Observable evidence suggests four revealed preferences:
  (1) Process over outcome — announcement is the product; June
  deadline creates visible process regardless of result. (2) Avoid
  new costs — US aid reduced 97%; enforcement requires reversing
  this trajectory. (3) Personal relationship as channel — Trump-Putin
  bilateral rapport tolerates deadline slippage; damaging the channel
  to enforce the timeline is structurally unlikely. (4) Domestic
  calendar — midterms November 2026; a "breakthrough" in September-
  October serves better than enforcement in June.
  Assessment: Trump's revealed preferences converge with Russia's
  Option C (engage to outlast). June deadline is a shared performance,
  not a forcing function. Risk case: visible humanitarian catastrophe
  or domestic political shock making inaction costlier than
  enforcement. Discriminating signal: whether Trump's rhetoric shifts
  from "progress" to "consequences" in April–May 2026.
  Source: Decision Points Session 006.

IRAN:
  Dimension: Partnership credibility; defence interdependency
  Key distinction: Russia–Iran strategic partnership (January 2025
  treaty) is structurally asymmetric. Russia values Iran as a
  geopolitical counterweight and drone/munition supplier; Iran values
  Russia as a military-industrial guarantor and diplomatic shield.
  The asymmetry becomes acute when US pressure forces Russia to
  choose between the US relationship (on which settlement depends)
  and the Iran partnership (on which regional influence depends).
  Revealed preference (Midnight Hammer, June 2025): Russia chose
  the US relationship. A second iteration would confirm the pattern
  and trigger partnership credibility decay (see Section VII).
  The Sadat pivot (Soviet loss of Egypt, 1970s) is the historical
  parallel — Moscow calibrated support to its own survival needs,
  not the partner's security needs, and lost the partner.
  Update (February 2026): Active Decision Points engagement.
  Iran defence decision is the current test of partnership
  credibility.

OTTOMAN EMPIRE (historical):
  Dimension: Decline pattern
  Key distinction: The late Ottoman Empire showed the same pattern
  of military capability with eroding internal legitimacy. The
  gap between what the state could do and what the state would do
  widened as legitimacy stress increased — a pattern directly
  relevant to monitoring Russian stability indicators.

BYZANTINE EMPIRE (historical):
  Dimension: Civilizational inheritance
  Key distinction: Russia's Third Rome claim shapes its
  civilizational self-conception and legitimacy structure. The
  Byzantine inheritance is not merely historical; it is an active
  component of the legitimacy narrative.

X. COUNSEL LOG
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
ENTRY 001 — February 2026
  Session: Initial COUNSEL file creation
  Sources analysed: CIV–CORE–RUSSIA v3.2, CIV–SCHOLAR–RUSSIA v3.1,
  CIV–DOCTRINE–RUSSIA v3.2, MEM–RUSSIA–PETERSBURG v3.4, and
  broader Russia MEM corpus (191 files)
  Options established: A (Endurance), B (Settlement), C (Diversification),
  D (Escalation)
  Completeness audit: PASSED
  Stability assessment: 2/5 STRESSED, 0/5 CRITICAL

ENTRY 002 — February 2026
  Session: v1.1 refinement — grounding lines and binding constraints
  Change: Added grounding lines to all four material options. Each
  grounding line names historical precedents assessed and identifies
  the single binding constraint (the variable with fastest collapse
  speed and least controllability). No indicator counts; no false
  quantitative precision.
  Binding constraints identified:
  • Option A: Industrial replacement rate vs operational consumption
  • Option B: Existence of mutually acceptable settlement formula
  • Option C: Absorption capacity of alternative partners (esp. China)
  • Option D: Opponent response to escalation (concession vs counter)
  Completeness audit: PASSED (unchanged)
  Next review: When new evidence affects binding constraints

ENTRY 003 — 10 February 2026
  Session: v1.2 operational test — Abu Dhabi trilateral talks and
  economic signals
  Event: First trilateral Russia-Ukraine-US talks (Abu Dhabi,
  24-25 January 2026); Russia's 2026 budget reduction in defence;
  25%+ oil/gas revenue decline; Oreshnik IRBM deployment;
  France/UK peacekeeping troop signals.
  Changes:
  • Option A: Evidence update added. Binding constraint (replacement
    vs consumption) under strain from budget reduction and revenue
    decline. Direction: UNFAVOURABLE but not yet falsified.
  • Option B: Evidence update added. Binding constraint (settlement
    formula) being actively tested via Abu Dhabi talks. Direction:
    SLIGHTLY MORE PLAUSIBLE but gap remains very wide.
  • Option C: No direct new evidence. Economic pressure increases
    urgency of diversification (noted in fiscal pattern upgrade).
  • Option D: Evidence update added. Binding constraint (opponent
    concession vs counter-escalation) trending toward falsification.
    Coalition hardening observed as direct response to escalation.
    Direction: UNFAVOURABLE.
  Stability indicators: No status changes. Institutional function
  and elite cohesion assessments updated with specific fiscal
  evidence. Directional note added.
  Pattern upgrade: Fiscal Constraint and Restraint Preference
  upgraded from MODERATE to HIGH activation.
  Cross-entity update: US link updated to reflect trilateral
  mediator role.
  Completeness audit: PASSED (unchanged)
  Confidence changes: None. Evidence directional, not yet
  sufficient to revise confidence levels.
  Next review: After February round of Abu Dhabi talks concludes;
  or when defence production data (not budget data) becomes available.

ENTRY 004 — 10 February 2026
  Session: v1.3 operational test — defence production and China
  absorption capacity
  Events analysed: Russia defence production targets and labour
  constraints (2025-2026 intelligence assessments); Russia-China
  trade decline (6.9% in 2025 to $228.1B); China absorption
  plateau; payment infrastructure fragility; workforce deficit
  (160,000 defence sector, 1.9M manufacturing); Soviet stockpile
  depletion timeline.
  Changes:
  • Option A: Evidence Update 2 added. Production data provides
    granular reading: near-term replacement adequate (250 tanks,
    1,100 IFVs, ~2,500 missiles/year, 250k shells/month). But
    Soviet stockpiles projected exhausted mid-2025; labour deficit
    160,000 in defence; workforce aging. Binding constraint has
    a visible time horizon (12-24 months). Direction: MIXED.
  • Option C: Evidence update added. Russia-China trade declined
    6.9% in 2025 — structural plateau, not political choice.
    China's absorption capacity showing limits. Dependency
    asymmetric and deepening. Payment infrastructure fragile.
    Binding constraint showing its limits. Direction: UNFAVOURABLE;
    confidence trending toward LOW.
  • Option B: No new evidence beyond v1.2.
  • Option D: No new evidence beyond v1.2.
  Pattern updates: Endurance Through Compression — medium-term
  structural ceiling noted with production data.
  Cross-entity updates: China link expanded to include economic
  dependency dimension and structural plateau evidence.
  Completeness audit: PASSED (unchanged)
  Confidence changes: Option C direction noted (trending LOW);
  formal downgrade deferred pending next quarter's trade data.
  Cumulative binding constraint status (all four options):
  • A (replacement vs consumption): UNDER STRAIN, time-limited
  • B (settlement formula): BEING TESTED, not met
  • C (China absorption): SHOWING LIMITS, trending unfavourable
  • D (opponent response): TRENDING TOWARD FALSIFICATION
  Next review: Q1 2026 Russia-China trade data; actual (not
  planned) defence production output; Abu Dhabi talks outcome.

ENTRY 005 — 10 February 2026
  Session: v1.4 cognitive integration — Decision Points harvest
  Source: Decision Points Sessions 001–002 (ARC–RUSSIA–DECISION–POINTS)
  Changes:
  • Section III.C: Added decision-quality distortion mechanism —
    personalist systems optimise for leader's survival horizon,
    not state interest. Divergence widens under fiscal constraint.
    Precedents: Peter/Panin, Catherine/Crimea, 1991 nomenklatura,
    Midnight Hammer June 2025.
  • Section III Tensions (Power vs Liability): Added diagnostic —
    revealed preference hierarchy for personalist systems. What
    leadership actually chose > structural logic > legitimacy analysis.
  • Section VII: Three new patterns added:
    - Fiscal-Temporal Compression Trap (HIGH) — cannot slow down,
      cannot speed up; fiscal constraint vs governance-tempo conflict
    - Revealed Preference Under Analogous Constraint (HIGH) —
      Midnight Hammer as baseline predictor
    - Partnership Credibility Decay (MODERATE) — personalist
      under-delivery on alliance commitments; Sadat pivot parallel
  • Section VIII: Iran cross-entity link added — partnership
    credibility test, Midnight Hammer precedent, Sadat parallel.
  Completeness audit: PASSED
  Next review: Post next Iran-related news cycle; post Abu Dhabi
  talks outcome.

ENTRY 006 — 10 February 2026
  Session: v1.5 — retrospective Decision Points (Jan 1 2026)
  and revealed preference diagnostic validation
  Source: Decision Points Session 003 (ARC–RUSSIA–DECISION–POINTS)
  Changes:
  • Option A: Evidence Update 3 added. Four new instruments since
    Jan 1 assessed against all four Material Options. Three
    instruments (Trump channel, Board of Peace, energy pause)
    strengthen Option A near-term. One (Sumy buffer zone) weakens
    it. Medium-term ceiling unchanged. Concentration risk flagged:
    all three favourable instruments depend on Trump relationship.
  • Section VII (Revealed Preference): VALIDATED status. Tested
    against three retrospective Jan 1 decision points. On both
    divergent decisions (Oreshnik pricing, fiscal shock), liability
    prediction matched actual outcome. Hierarchy confirmed:
    liability > structural > legitimacy. Now the strongest
    predictive tool in the COUNSEL framework for this leadership.
  Completeness audit: PASSED
  Confidence changes: Option A near-term strengthened; medium-term
  unchanged. Revealed preference pattern upgraded to VALIDATED.
  Next review: June 2026 (Trump deadline); or if Trump relationship
  shows strain before then.

ENTRY 007 — 10 February 2026
  Session: v1.6 — opponent constraint assessment and relative
  binding constraint reframe
  Source: Decision Points Session 004 (ARC–RUSSIA–DECISION–POINTS)
  Changes:
  • NEW SECTION VI-B: Opponent Constraint Assessment. Tracks
    Ukraine's three binding constraints (manpower: BINDING NOW;
    Western support: DETERIORATING; morale: STRESSED TO CRITICAL).
    Includes relative degradation assessment and discriminating
    signals for both curves.
  • Option A: Binding constraint REFRAMED from absolute (Russia's
    replacement vs consumption) to relative (does Ukraine's capacity
    degrade faster than Russia's fiscal base?). Confidence upgraded
    MODERATE → MODERATE-HIGH. The opponent's manpower curve is
    steeper than Russia's fiscal curve — "win on the battlefield"
    is assessed as a real variant, not only a narrative.
  • Completeness audit: Added opponent constraint and relative
    binding constraint checklist items. Previous audit status
    retroactively identified as having a structural gap (power
    perspective applied to one side only).
  Methodological finding: Entity-oriented COUNSEL framework
  systematically underweights opponent degradation. The three
  perspectives (legitimacy, power, liability) all look inward.
  Power perspective must be applied to relative position, not
  entity position alone. This gap should be corrected in
  CIV–COUNSEL–TEMPLATE for all civilisation files.
  Completeness audit: PASSED (with new requirements)
  Next review: When advance rate data (Q1 2026) and Ukrainian
  brigade strength estimates become available.

ENTRY 008 — 10 February 2026
  Session: Scenario Tree — front-line collapse trigger (ungrounded)
  Note: This session was identified as operating without direct
  MEM file reading. Three MEMs cited by name but not read; eight
  historical parallels from general knowledge ungrounded. Led to
  three-source compositional principle (CIV–COUNSEL–TEMPLATE v1.9)
  and MEM grounding enforcement (cmc-counsel-mem-grounding rule).

ENTRY 009 — 10 February 2026
  Session: Scenario Tree — front-line collapse trigger (grounded re-run)
  Source: Three-source grounding test
  Changes:
  • Same trigger re-run with proper MEM SCAN: read MEM–RELEVANCE–
    RUSSIA, loaded 5 primary MEMs (WAR–NAPOLEON, BOLSHEVIK–
    REVOLUTION, BARBAROSSA, CONGRESS–VIENNA, CATHERINE–GREAT,
    PANIN). Specific details from MEMs shaped branch analysis.
  • Convergence analysis confirmed frozen conflict overdetermined;
    MEM grounding strengthened the mechanism (Catherine lock-in,
    Vienna sacrifice-to-authority, fiscal-temporal compression
    all converge through independent causal paths).
  • Layer 3 MEM generation candidates: Korean armistice 1953,
    Cuban Missile Crisis 1962, Kyiv 2022 advance.
  Completeness audit: PASSED (three-source grounding verified)

ENTRY 010 — 11 February 2026
  Session: Decision Points Session 006 (grounded)
  Source: ARC–RUSSIA–DECISION–POINTS Session 006
  Changes:
  • Three decision points identified with three-source grounding
    (8 MEMs loaded). DP2 deepened: three options mapped (A engage,
    B outlast, C engage to outlast). Current policy assessed as
    Option C based on observable evidence across all three DPs.
  • New analytical product: Option C ("engage to outlast") as
    distinct strategic mode with Nicholas II Duma precedent.
    Discriminating signals mapped for C→A and C→B transitions.
  • Binding question reframed: not what the leadership chooses
    but what forces a transition from C.
  Completeness audit: PASSED
  Next review: March–April 2026 (Istanbul/Geneva round composition;
  Q1 advance-rate data; Oreshnik deployment watch; Trump-Putin
  direct contact)
