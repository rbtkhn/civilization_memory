## Verbatim quotes (attributable)

### K1 — Rasputitsa (Russia / seasons / steppe)

> "It is a paradox of campaigning in Russia that, though winter destroys
> armies, it is the coming of spring that halts operations. The thaw,
> saturating the suddenly unfrozen topsoil with thirty inches of snow
> melt, turns the dirt roads liquid and the surface of the steppe to
> swamp, the rasputitsa, 'internal seas' of mud which clog all movement."
> — John Keegan, *The Second World War* (1990)

**Suggested MEMs:** MEM–RUSSIA–WAR–GREAT–PATRIOTIC–OPERATION–BARBAROSSA, MEM–RUSSIA–WAR–GREAT–PATRIOTIC–MOSCOW, MEM–RUSSIA–GEO–STEPPE.

### K2 — Red Army / Stavka capacity (1942)

> "The Stavka calculated that there were 16 million men of military age
> in Russia and that the strength of the Red Army could be raised to 9
> million in 1942; allowing for 3 million already taken prisoner and a
> million dead, there would still be enough men to fill 400 divisions
> and provide replacements."
> — John Keegan, *The Second World War* (1990)

**Suggested MEMs:** MEM–RUSSIA–WAR–GREAT–PATRIOTIC–OPERATION–BARBAROSSA, MEM–RUSSIA–WAR–GREAT–PATRIOTIC, MEM–RUSSIA–WAR–STAVKA.

### K4 — Stalingrad: first undeniable Russian victory

> "There was no need for the fabrication of epic in Russia. On the news

**Suggested MEMs:** MEM–RUSSIA–WAR–GREAT–PATRIOTIC–STALINGRAD.
