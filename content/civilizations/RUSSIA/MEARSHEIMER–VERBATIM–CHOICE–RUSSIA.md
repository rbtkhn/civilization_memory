## Available verbatim quotes (FA 2014) — choose by ID

**M1** — West's responsibility  
> "The United States and its European allies share most of the responsibility for the crisis."

**M2** — NATO taproot  
> "The taproot of the trouble is NATO enlargement, the central element of a larger strategy to move Ukraine out of Russia's orbit and integrate it into the West."

**M3** — Russian leaders would not stand by  
> "Since the mid-1990s, Russian leaders have adamantly opposed NATO enlargement, and in recent years, they have made it clear that they would not stand by while their strategically important neighbor turned into a Western bastion."

**M4** — Core strategic interests (backyard)  
> "Putin's pushback should have come as no surprise. After all, the West had been moving into Russia's backyard and threatening its core strategic interests, a point Putin made emphatically and repeatedly."

**M5** — Western stronghold on Russia's border  
> "U.S. and European leaders blundered in attempting to turn Ukraine into a Western stronghold on Russia's border."

**M6** — Buffer state (full; Ukraine as invasion route)  
> "Putin's actions should be easy to comprehend. A huge expanse of flat land that Napoleonic France, imperial Germany, and Nazi Germany all crossed to strike at Russia itself, Ukraine serves as a buffer state of enormous strategic importance to Russia. No Russian leader would tolerate a military alliance that was Moscow's mortal enemy until recently moving into Ukraine."

**M7** — Geopolitics 101  
> "This is Geopolitics 101: great powers are always sensitive to potential threats near their home territory."

**M8** — Russia declining power  
> "Russia is a declining power, and it will only get weaker with time."

**M9** — Core strategic interests (punishment)  
> "History shows that countries will absorb enormous amounts of punishment in order to protect their core strategic interests. There is no reason to think Russia represents an exception to this rule."

**M10** — Neutral buffer (Austria)  
> "The United States and its allies should abandon their plan to westernize Ukraine and instead aim to make it a neutral buffer between NATO and Russia, akin to Austria's position during the Cold War."

**M11** — Dnieper bisects  
> "Roughly 15 million people—one-third of Ukraine's population—live between the Dnieper River, which bisects the country, and the Russian border."

**M12** — Might makes right  
> "The sad truth is that might often makes right when great-power politics are at play."

**M13** — Self-determination meaningless  
> "Abstract rights such as self-determination are largely meaningless when powerful states get into brawls with weaker states."

**M14** — Cuba / Ukraine analogy  
> "Did Cuba have the right to form a military alliance with the Soviet Union during the Cold War? The United States certainly did not think so, and the Russians think the same way about Ukraine joining the West."

**M15** — China, Canada, Mexico  
> "Imagine the outrage in Washington if China built an impressive military alliance and tried to include Canada and Mexico in it."
