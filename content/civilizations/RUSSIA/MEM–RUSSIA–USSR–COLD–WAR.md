I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves the Cold War as **the forty-year superpower
competition** between the United States and the Soviet Union: ideological
rivalry, nuclear deterrence, proxy conflicts, and the eventual
exhaustion of the Soviet system.

For Russian civilizational memory, the Cold War is **Soviet Russia
as co-equal superpower**—legitimized by victory, sustained by
ideology and arms, ended by economic and political failure.

This MEM does NOT resolve:
• Whether the Cold War was inevitable after 1945
• Whether détente or confrontation better served either side
• Whether Soviet collapse was structural or contingent

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. ORIGINS: FROM ALLIANCE TO CONFRONTATION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Cold War emerged from the wartime alliance.

Structural factors:
• Soviet occupation of Eastern Europe (Tehran, Yalta, Potsdam)
• US nuclear monopoly, then Soviet acquisition (1949)
• Ideological incompatibility (capitalism vs. communism)
• Mutual perception of threat (encirclement vs. expansion)

Key markers:
• Churchill's "Iron Curtain" speech (March 1946)
• Truman Doctrine (1947)
• Marshall Plan and Soviet rejection (1947–48)
• Berlin blockade (1948–49)
• NATO (1949); Warsaw Pact (1955)

The post-war order **divided at the Elbe**; the Cold War was the
management of that division.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. COMPETITION: IDEOLOGY AND SYSTEMS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Odd Arne Westad describes the nature of the contest:

"The Cold War was not merely a conflict between states but between
systems. Each superpower claimed to represent the future—capitalism
or communism, liberal democracy or people's democracy. The competition
was ideological, military, economic, and cultural. The Soviet Union
held its own for forty years: nuclear parity, space achievements,
support for decolonization movements. But the economic competition
was slowly lost. By the 1980s, the Soviet system could not generate
the wealth to sustain the contest."
— Odd Arne Westad, *The Cold War: A World History* (2017)

The Cold War was **sustained competition ending in exhaustion**.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. DÉTENTE: COMPETITION AND COEXISTENCE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
From the late 1960s through the 1970s, superpower relations combined
containment with dialogue.

Henry Kissinger articulated the logic that underlay détente even
amid competition:

"The challenge of our time is to reconcile the reality of competition
with the imperative of coexistence."
— Henry Kissinger, statement on détente (1974); *Diplomacy* (1994)

He framed the presidency's dual responsibility in that era:

"A President thus has a dual responsibility: he must resist Soviet
expansionism, and he must be conscious of the risks of global
confrontation. His policy must embrace both deterrence and coexistence,
both containment and an effort to relax tensions."
— Henry Kissinger, *Years of Upheaval* (1982)

The nuclear premise underlying détente was equally explicit:

"Both major nuclear powers must base their policies on the premise
that neither can expect to impose its will on the other without
running an intolerable risk."
— Henry Kissinger, détente-era formulation (1970s); *Diplomacy* (1994)

Détente did not end the Cold War; it **managed** it. Summits (Nixon–
Brezhnev, SALT) reflected the balance of power and the shared interest
in avoiding nuclear war.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. NUCLEAR DETERRENCE AND PARITY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The nuclear dimension defined the conflict.

Characteristics:
• Mutual assured destruction (MAD)
• Arms control (SALT I and II, INF, START)
• Crises (Cuba 1962; Berlin; Able Archer 1983)
• No direct great-power war

Soviet achievement: parity by the 1970s. The USSR was accepted as
a nuclear equal; diplomacy reflected that. Closed military zones
(Kaliningrad, Murmansk) and forward deployments existed within the
constraint that neither side could impose its will without intolerable
risk.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. PROXY WARS AND THEATRES
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Conflict was displaced to third theatres.

Key episodes (Russian-civilization lens):
• Korea (1950–53) — Soviet client; partition confirmed
• Vietnam — US–Soviet proxy dimension
• Afghanistan (1979–89) — Soviet overextension; legitimacy cost
• Angola, Ethiopia, Nicaragua — Soviet support for allies
• Berlin (blockade, wall, crises) — frontline of division

The Cold War was **global** but **indirect** between the superpowers;
direct war was avoided.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. END OF THE COLD WAR
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Cold War ended with Soviet retreat and collapse.

Sequence:
• Gorbachev's reforms (glasnost, perestroika)
• Withdrawal from Afghanistan (1989)
• Fall of Berlin Wall (1989)
• Eastern European revolutions (1989)
• Soviet dissolution (1991)

MEM–RUSSIA–GORBACHEV and MEM–RUSSIA–SOVIET–UNION record the terminal
phase. The Cold War was **sustained competition ending in exhaustion**—
the Soviet system could not generate the wealth or legitimacy to
continue the contest.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VIII. CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Cold War encodes for Russian memory:

• Superpower status was achieved and maintained for four decades.
• Nuclear parity was a condition of coexistence, not surrender.
• Détente reconciled competition with coexistence; Kissinger's
  formulation captured the logic.
• Collapse was exhaustion of the Soviet system, not military defeat.
• The post–Cold War order left Russia diminished but not erased.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IX. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Neither side could impose its will without intolerable risk.
• Containment and coexistence were dual responsibilities.
• Ideological and economic competition outlasted military stalemate.
• Great-power summits reflected the balance of power.

POLYPHONIC TENSIONS:
• MERCOURIS: Cold War as ideological competition → ideas and
  legitimacy mattered
• MEARSHEIMER: Cold War as power competition → material factors
  and balance of power determined outcome
• Both: Détente was the management of competition under nuclear
  constraint.

Tension preserved without verdict.
