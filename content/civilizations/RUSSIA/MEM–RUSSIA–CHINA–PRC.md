I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves Russia's relationship with the **People's Republic
of China** as the arc from revolutionary brotherhood through hostile
split to strategic rapprochement: the encounter of two continental
powers whose ideological alliance collapsed and whose present partnership
is driven by shared opposition to American primacy rather than by
shared doctrine.

For Russian civilizational memory, the PRC encodes **the neighbor that
became enemy and then partner again**—proof that neither ideology nor
border conflict need permanently fix the relationship when structural
incentives shift.

This MEM preserves:
• The founding of the Sino-Soviet alliance (1950) and its ideological basis
• The Sino-Soviet split (1956–1969) and border war risk
• Normalization and border settlement (1989–2004)
• Strategic partnership (2014–present) and "no limits" rhetoric
• Structural asymmetry and Russian anxiety about junior-partner status

What this MEM does NOT resolve:
• Whether current partnership is durable or contingent on US pressure
• Whether China will eventually dominate Russia in the relationship
• Whether ideological convergence is possible or irrelevant

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. FOUNDING ALLIANCE (1949–1955)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The PRC was born with Soviet sponsorship. Russian memory encodes the
alliance as natural—two revolutionary states against the capitalist West.

Lorenz Lüthi establishes the frame:

"The Sino-Soviet alliance of 1950 was born of shared ideology and shared
enemies. Both regimes claimed Marxist-Leninist legitimacy. Both faced
American hostility. Both sought to transform their societies through
revolutionary mobilization. The alliance seemed natural—two communist
giants united against the capitalist West. Few predicted how quickly
ideological brotherhood would fracture into bitter rivalry."
— Lorenz Lüthi, *The Sino-Soviet Split: Cold War in the Communist World* (2008) [ERC-SECONDARY]

Key elements:
• Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance (1950)
• Soviet economic and technical assistance to PRC industrialization
• Comintern legacy and CCP dependency on Soviet recognition
• Korean War: both support North Korea; China bears the human cost

The alliance is remembered as **genuine while it lasted**—and as having
been structurally fragile from the start.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. THE SINO-SOVIET SPLIT (1956–1969)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Ideological unity collapsed. Russian memory encodes the split as both
doctrinal and inevitable.

Odd Arne Westad summarizes the rupture:

"The Sino-Soviet split was the most consequential schism in twentieth-
century communism. Two states that had proclaimed eternal friendship
came close to nuclear war by 1969. Ideology mattered: Mao believed
Khrushchev had betrayed Marxism-Leninism. Power mattered: neither Beijing
nor Moscow would accept subordinate status. Territory mattered: the
Ussuri River clashes demonstrated that revolutionary solidarity could
not overcome border disputes inherited from imperial predecessors."
— Odd Arne Westad, *The Cold War: A World History* (2017) [ERC-SECONDARY]

Causes encoded in Russian memory:
• De-Stalinization (1956) and Mao's rejection of revisionism
• Disputes over peaceful coexistence and nuclear sharing
• Leadership rivalry and refusal of subordination
• Border incidents (1969) and risk of general war

The split is remembered as **ideologically real and structurally
overdetermined**—two great powers sharing a long border could not
remain in a stable hierarchy.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III.A POLYPHONIC TENSION: IDEOLOGY VS STRUCTURE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Mercouris reading stresses the ideological dimension: genuine
doctrinal disagreement over de-Stalinization and revolutionary
strategy; ideas drove the rupture.

The Mearsheimer sharpening adds: the split was structurally
predictable regardless of doctrine.

• Mercouris: The split occurred because of real ideological differences;
  Mao genuinely believed Khrushchev had betrayed Marxism; ideas shaped
  the conflict.
• Mearsheimer: Two great powers cannot share a border without rivalry;
  ideology masked but did not cause the underlying power competition;
  China's rise made conflict inevitable regardless of doctrine.

Both readings are valid. Tension preserved without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. BORDER SETTLEMENT & NORMALIZATION (1989–2004)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The end of the Cold War allowed reconciliation. Russia and the PRC
resolved territorial disputes that had fueled confrontation.

Gilbert Rozman describes the transformation:

"The Sino-Russian border settlement of 2004 resolved disputes that had
festered for centuries. Russia transferred Tarabarov Island and part of
Bolshoi Ussuriysky Island to China—the first territorial concession by
Russia to any neighbor since 1945. The agreement closed the book on
imperialism and opened a new chapter of partnership. Both states chose
to prioritize strategic cooperation over historical grievance."
— Gilbert Rozman, *The Sino-Russian Challenge to the World Order* (2014) [ERC-SECONDARY]

Developments:
• Gorbachev's Beijing visit (1989)
• Progressive border demarcation (1991–2008)
• Final settlement (2004)
• Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (2001)

The border became a **managed asset**—a rare instance of Russian
territorial concession in exchange for strategic clarity.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIP (2014–PRESENT)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Western pressure after 2014 (Ukraine, sanctions) accelerated
Sino-Russian convergence. Russian memory encodes the partnership as
strategic necessity, not sentiment.

Alexander Lukin explains the logic:

"The Sino-Russian partnership is driven by shared perception of American
threat. Neither Moscow nor Beijing seeks to subordinate the other. Both
benefit from coordination against Western pressure. The partnership is
not an alliance—there is no mutual defense commitment—but it is more than
tactical convenience. It is a structural response to American primacy,
and it will endure as long as that primacy persists."
— Alexander Lukin, *China and Russia: The New Rapprochement* (2018) [ERC-SECONDARY]

Dimensions:
• Joint opposition to US hegemony and UN Security Council coordination
• Energy interdependence (Power of Siberia pipeline)
• Military exercises and defense cooperation
• "No limits" partnership declaration (2022)

The partnership is remembered as **conditional on American pressure**
and on both sides' willingness to defer rivalry.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. STRUCTURAL ASYMMETRY & RUSSIAN ANXIETY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The relationship is marked by growing power imbalance. Russian memory
encodes anxiety about junior-partner status.

Bobo Lo states the tension:

"Russia and China are partners, but not equals. The power asymmetry
continues to grow. Russia needs China more than China needs Russia.
Moscow sells raw materials; Beijing sells manufactured goods. Russian
elites worry about becoming China's junior partner, about the Far East
becoming an economic appendage of Manchuria. The partnership survives
because both face Washington, but the internal dynamics are unstable."
— Bobo Lo, *Russia and the New World Disorder* (2015) [ERC-SECONDARY]

Asymmetries:
• China's GDP ~10× Russia's
• Chinese population ~10× Russian Far East
• Technology and manufacturing gap
• Russian dependency on Chinese market for hydrocarbons

Russian memory preserves **partnership and unease**—convergence against
the West does not erase the possibility of future subordination.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The PRC occupies a distinctive place in Russian memory.

Encoded meanings:
• The neighbor that was ally, then enemy, then partner again
• Proof that ideology can bind and then fracture; structure outlasts doctrine
• The power that accepted Russian territorial concession (2004) and thus enabled détente
• The partner against American hegemony—and the potential future hegemon in Eurasia
• Continental peer requiring perpetual management, not conquest or submission

The PRC is remembered as **strategic partner and potential rival**—a
relationship that remains unresolved by design.

IX. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Ideology can found an alliance but cannot sustain it when power balances shift.
• Two continental great powers sharing a long border will experience rivalry unless a third party dominates both.
• Territorial concession (2004) was the price of strategic clarity for Russia.
• The partnership is structurally dependent on American pressure; remove it and rivalry resurfaces.
• Asymmetry generates anxiety even when interests align.
• The PRC is remembered as partner and potential hegemon—tension preserved.

POLYPHONIC TENSIONS:
• MERCOURIS: Partnership as genuine convergence → shared worldview against the West.
• MEARSHEIMER: Partnership as tactical convenience → structural rivalry deferred, not resolved.
• Both: The relationship is managed, not resolved.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.
