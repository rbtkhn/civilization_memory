I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves the Russian Federation as **the successor state
to the USSR**: the federal republic that emerged from the dissolution
of the Soviet Union in 1991, continuing the territory and institutions
of the RSFSR under a new name and constitutional order.

For Russian civilizational memory, the Federation is **Russia
reduced but intact**—the core civilizational space retained when
the union republics left, and the structure within which post-Soviet
authority was first contested and then recentralized.

This MEM does NOT resolve:
• Whether the Federation is a nation-state or an empire in federal form
• Whether asymmetric federalism strengthens or endangers the state
• Whether recentralization was necessary or oppressive

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. FORMATION: FROM RSFSR TO FEDERATION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Russian Federation did not declare independence from the USSR;
it inherited the RSFSR when the Union ceased to exist.

Sequence:
• December 8, 1991: Belovezha Accords (Russia, Ukraine, Belarus)—
  USSR declared dissolved
• December 21, 1991: Alma-Ata Protocol—11 republics join; Gorbachev
  resigns December 25
• December 26, 1991: USSR formally dissolved
• RSFSR had already declared sovereignty (June 1990); in 1991 it
  became the continuation of the Soviet state under the name
  Russian Federation

The Federation is **RSFSR renamed**, not a new state. Territory:
the former RSFSR minus any secessions (none completed within current
borders except by force majeure). MEM–RUSSIA–GORBACHEV and MEM–RUSSIA–
SOVIET–UNION record the dissolution; the Federation is what remained.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. FEDERAL STRUCTURE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Federation is formally a federal state with asymmetric units.

Constitutional design (1993 Constitution):
• 89 subjects (later 85 after mergers): republics, krais, oblasts,
  federal cities, autonomous oblast, autonomous okrugs
• Republics (e.g. Tatarstan, Bashkortostan, Chechnya) have constitutions
  and official languages; named for titular nationalities
• Oblasts and krais are predominantly Russian; no titular ethnicity
• Federal cities: Moscow, St. Petersburg, Sevastopol (from 2014)

Asymmetry:
• Republics negotiated power-sharing treaties in the 1990s (Tatarstan,
  Bashkortostan); some claimed sovereignty
• Putin-era recentralization: treaties abrogated or subordinated;
  governors appointed then elected under federal control
• Chechnya: special status after two wars; Kadyrovite stability
  in exchange for loyalty and subsidy

Ronald Grigor Suny's formulation (from the Soviet context) has a
post-Soviet echo: the federation can function as **fiction** (power
flows from the center) or as **potential exit** (republics have
constitutional standing). Putin's vertical of power aimed to make
the fiction permanent.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. CENTRE–PERIPHERY: YELTSIN TO PUTIN
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The 1990s saw bargaining between Moscow and the regions.

Yeltsin era:
• "Take as much sovereignty as you can swallow"—regions and republics
  extracted treaties, fiscal concessions, de facto autonomy
• Weak center; governors and republic presidents as power brokers
• Chechnya: secession attempt; two wars (1994–96, 1999–2000);
  federal victory in second war
• Risk of further fragmentation (Tatarstan, others)

Putin era:
• Federal districts (2000)—presidential envoys over regions
• Unification of federal law; governors brought under Moscow
• Power-sharing treaties phased out
• Republics retained symbolic status; real power recentralized
• MEM–RUSSIA–PUTIN and MEM–RUSSIA–LAW–AUTOCRACY record the vertical
  of power; the Federation is the **territorial container** within
  which that vertical operates.

The memory function: **federalism was reversible**. The same structure
that allowed bargaining in the 1990s was tightened in the 2000s.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY AND EXCLAVES
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Federation includes territory that is geographically discontinuous.

Kaliningrad:
• Exclave between Lithuania and Poland; no land connection to
  mainland Russia. MEM–RUSSIA–KALININGRAD records the strategic
  and identity significance. The Federation **includes** Kaliningrad
  as a subject; transit depends on neighbouring states.

Crimea and Sevastopol:
• Annexed in March 2014; incorporated as republic and federal city.
  MEM–RUSSIA–CRIMEA and MEM–RUSSIA–SEVASTOPOL record the event.
  Internationally contested; within Russian law they are subjects
  of the Federation.

The Federation's borders are thus **legally fixed in Russian domestic
terms** and **contested in international terms** (Crimea). Tension
preserved.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. CONTINUITY WITH SOVIET AND IMPERIAL SPACE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Federation occupies the core of the former RSFSR and, before that,
the heartland of the Russian Empire.

Continuities:
• Territory: the RSFSR's borders (minus Baltic, Central Asian,
  Caucasian, Ukrainian, Belarussian SSRs) became the Federation
• Institutions: army, security services, bureaucracy, nuclear
  inheritance—continued with new names
• Capital: Moscow; seat of power unchanged
• Identity: "Russian" as civilizational and state category;
  multi-ethnic but Russian-dominated

The Federation is **the same civilizational space under a new
constitutional label**. MEM–RUSSIA–SOVIET–UNION describes what
dissolved; MEM–RUSSIA–FEDERATION describes what remained and how
it is structured.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Federation encodes:

• Successor state is continuity, not creation—RSFSR renamed.
• Federal structure can enable bargaining or be tightened into
  central control.
• Territorial integrity (Kaliningrad, Crimea) is politically
  and symbolically central.
• The same space that was the Soviet core is now the Russian
  Federation—one state, one civilizational container.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VIII. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Dissolution of the Union left the core intact as the Federation.
• Asymmetric federalism was first conceded, then clawed back.
• Exclaves and annexed territory test the limits of "federation"
  in practice.
• Center-periphery relations are a permanent tension in Russian
  statehood.
