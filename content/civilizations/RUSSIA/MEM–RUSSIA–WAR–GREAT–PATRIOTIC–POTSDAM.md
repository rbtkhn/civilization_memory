I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves the Potsdam Conference as **the closing act of
the Big Three**: the summit where Truman, Stalin, and Churchill
(and Attlee) formalized the partition of Germany, assigned northern
East Prussia to the USSR (Kaliningrad), and conducted diplomacy
in the shadow of the atomic bomb.

For Russian civilizational memory, Potsdam is **victory's territorial
settlement**—the moment when Soviet gains were ratified in international
law and the post-war order was fixed on the ground.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. STRATEGIC CONTEXT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
July 1945 situation:

Europe:
• Germany surrendered (May 8, 1945)
• Soviet forces occupied Eastern Europe and eastern Germany
• Western Allies held western Germany
• Berlin divided into sectors

Pacific:
• Japan still fighting
• Atomic bomb untested (Trinity: July 16, 1945)
• Soviet entry against Japan agreed at Yalta, not yet executed

Potsdam occurred after victory in Europe and before victory in Asia.
The balance of power was fixed by occupation, not negotiation.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. THE MEETING
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Potsdam was the third and last Big Three summit.

Participants:
• Joseph Stalin (USSR)
• Harry S. Truman (USA) — Roosevelt's successor
• Winston Churchill (UK), then Clement Attlee (from July 26)

Location: Cecilienhof Palace, Potsdam, Germany (Soviet zone)
Duration: Seventeen days

Stalin's position:
• Red Army occupied agreed zones
• No incentive to concede
• Sought reparations, security, and recognition of territorial gains
• Tested Truman's resolve

Truman's position:
• New to office; inherited Yalta commitments
• Learned of Trinity success during conference
• Sought Soviet entry against Japan; later atomic use reduced that need
• Unwilling to reverse Soviet occupation of Eastern Europe

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III.A REALIST SHARPENING: DIPLOMACY REFLECTS POWER
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Mercouris reading frames Potsdam as the Allies completing the
post-war architecture—formalizing what had been agreed in principle
at Tehran and Yalta.

The realist sharpening adds: Potsdam ratified facts on the ground.
Nothing of substance was negotiated away; occupation determined outcome.

Henry Kissinger frames the nature of such summits:

"At a great-power conference, diplomacy does not create the balance
of power; it reflects it."
— Henry Kissinger, *Diplomacy* (1994)

At Potsdam, Soviet forces held eastern Germany, Poland, and the
Baltic; the negotiators were not free to ignore that. The conference
**reflected** the balance of power established by the Red Army.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. GERMANY: PARTITION AND REPARATIONS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Germany was divided into zones of occupation.

Agreements:
• Four zones: US, UK, France, USSR
• Berlin similarly quartered (inside Soviet zone)
• Allied Control Council for joint policy
• Demilitarization, denazification, democratization (language)
• Reparations: each power from its own zone; USSR additionally from
  western zones in exchange for food and raw materials (formula disputed)

Soviet gains:
• Eastern zone under full Soviet control
• Reparations from own zone (dismantling, labour)
• No unified German state—division served Soviet security

The structural outcome: **Germany could not threaten Russia again**
from the east; the Oder–Neisse line and Soviet zone guaranteed it.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. TERRITORIAL SETTLEMENT: EAST PRUSSIA AND KALININGRAD
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Northern East Prussia was transferred to the USSR.

Potsdam Protocol:
• Königsberg and adjacent territory assigned to Soviet Union
• Polish administration of former German territory east of Oder–Neisse
• De facto annexation of northern East Prussia by USSR
• 1946: renamed Kaliningrad (after Mikhail Kalinin)

For Russian civilizational memory, this is **the Red Army's territorial
harvest**—ice-free Baltic port, elimination of East Prussia as German
bridgehead, and population replacement (German flight and expulsion;
Soviet settlement).

MEM–RUSSIA–KALININGRAD records the outcome; Potsdam is its legal source.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. THE ATOMIC SHADOW
───────────────────────────────────────────────
Truman learned of the successful Trinity test (July 16) during the
conference. He informed Stalin in passing that the United States
possessed a new weapon of unusual destructive force. Stalin appeared
unmoved; Soviet intelligence already had knowledge of the Manhattan
Project.

Interpretation (tension preserved):
• Mercouris: Stalin understood the strategic shift; Soviet atomic
  program accelerated; Potsdam was the last summit before nuclear
  parity became the condition of diplomacy.
• Mearsheimer: Truman's disclosure did not change the bargaining;
  occupation had already determined the outcome. The bomb would
  matter for Japan and for the Cold War, not for European territorial
  settlement at Potsdam.

Potsdam thus stands at the threshold: **the last great-power conference
before the nuclear age fully shaped superpower relations**.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. POLAND: ODER–NEISSE AND WESTWARD SHIFT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Poland's western border was confirmed at Potsdam.

Settlement:
• Poland lost eastern territories (Kresy) to USSR (per Yalta/Curzon)
• Poland compensated with German territory east of Oder–Neisse
• Mass population transfers (Germans west; Poles into former German lands)
• Soviet-sponsored government in Warsaw recognized

The result: **Poland was shifted west**; Soviet security buffer extended;
Germany truncated. The arrangement held until 1990 (Two Plus Four).

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VIII. LEGACY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Potsdam closed the Big Three sequence.

What Potsdam established:
• Partition of Germany (and Berlin)
• Kaliningrad as Soviet (later Russian) territory
• Oder–Neisse as Poland's western border
• Reparations framework (contentious)
• Transition from wartime alliance to occupation regime

What Potsdam could not prevent:
• Cold War (Soviet–Western cooperation ended within years)
• Nuclear arms race
• Permanent division of Europe
• Berlin crises and wall

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IX. CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Potsdam encodes:

• Occupation determines territorial outcome; summits formalize it.
• Victory creates entitlement to security and territory.
• The third summit closed the loop opened at Tehran.
• Nuclear capability entered diplomacy but did not yet dominate it.
• Germany's partition was the price of Soviet security and Western
  inability to reverse Red Army gains.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
X. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Summits after victory ratify, they do not create.
• Territorial transfer follows military control.
• New weapons change future bargaining; they do not undo past occupation.
• Great-power conferences reflect the balance of power.

POLYPHONIC TENSIONS:
• MERCOURIS: Potsdam as necessary closure → orderly settlement
• MEARSHEIMER: Potsdam as ratification of conquest → power reflected
• Both: Tehran → Yalta → Potsdam form a single arc; diplomacy reflected
  the Red Army's position at each stage.

Tension preserved without verdict.
