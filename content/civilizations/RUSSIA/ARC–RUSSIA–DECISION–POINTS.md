Russia / Russian Federation

Status: ACTIVE
Version: 1.3
Entity: Russia / Russian Federation
Source File: CIV–COUNSEL–RUSSIA
Last Updated: 10 February 2026

Governed by: CIV–COUNSEL–TEMPLATE v1.6, Section X-B

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
SESSION 001 — 10 February 2026
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
COUNSEL version: v1.3
News period: 3–10 February 2026

Decision points identified:
1. Summer fiscal cliff — maintain war tempo (drain NWF) or
   adjust downward. [WEEKS] [OPEN]
2. Abu Dhabi negotiating space — signal territorial flexibility
   or hold maximalist position. [WEEKS] [OPEN]
3. Syria Mediterranean bases — pay concessions to retain
   Khmeimim/Tartous or accept contraction. [MONTHS] [OPEN]

Historical anchors: Catherine's fiscal restraint preference
(Panin-era alliance diplomacy under revenue constraint); the
1991 Soviet collapse (internal legitimacy failure despite
intact military capability).

Session finding: All three decisions exhibit structural-versus-
personal divergence. Structural logic favours adjustment;
personalist incentives predict the opposite. Window for
structurally rational choices estimated Q1–Q2 2026.

SESSION 002 — 10 February 2026
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
COUNSEL version: v1.3
News period: 3–10 February 2026
Topic: Russia's perspective on Iran defence against US/Israel

Decision points identified:
1. Air defence acceleration — accelerate S-400 transfers to
   Iran or hold pace for Abu Dhabi. [WEEKS] [OPEN]
2. Strategic partnership treaty activation — signal commitment
   or maintain verbal-only posture. [WEEKS] [OPEN]
3. Uranium card — activate enriched uranium removal offer or
   hold. [MONTHS] [OPEN]

Deepened: DP1 (acceleration). Path A explored through 90-day
sequence and three scenarios. Fiscal cliff recalibrated:
liquidity constraint, not solvency (~20% debt-to-GDP).
Key finding: Midnight Hammer precedent predicts floor-level
response again despite structural logic favouring acceleration.

Historical anchors: Operation Midnight Hammer (June 2025 —
Russia's muted response to US strike on Iran); 1962 Cuba
crisis (arming partner vs needing adversary's cooperation).

Session finding: Abu Dhabi–Tehran tension is the governing
constraint; Midnight Hammer reveals this leadership resolves
it in favour of the US relationship over partnership credibility.

SESSION 003 — 10 February 2026
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
COUNSEL version: v1.4
News period: Retrospective — 1 January 2026
Topic: Russia's critical decision points as of 1 January 2026

Decision points identified:
1. Abu Dhabi trilateral engagement — participate or hold
   position. [WEEKS] [RESOLVED: engaged Jan 22–25]
2. Oreshnik pricing — deterrent, bargaining chip, or
   ambiguous. [MONTHS] [RESOLVED: ambiguous + Lviv strike Jan 9]
3. Fiscal shock — absorb or adjust war economy.
   [WEEKS] [RESOLVED: partial adjust, 6.7% defence cut + record
   NWF drawdown]

Deepened: DP2 (Oreshnik pricing). Three options mapped (A:
maximum deterrent, B: explicit bargaining chip, C: ambiguous
pricing). Revealed preference diagnostic tested across all
three DPs.

Diagnostic test — revealed preference hierarchy:
• DP1: all three perspectives converged → untestable
• DP2: structural predicted B, legitimacy predicted A,
  liability predicted C → actual: C. Liability won.
• DP3: structural predicted full adjust, legitimacy predicted
  full absorb, liability predicted partial → actual: partial.
  Liability won.
Result: liability > structural > legitimacy on divergent DPs.

New instruments since Jan 1 (not available on that date):
• Trump personal-diplomacy channel (strengthens A, B near-term)
• Board of Peace proposal (strengthens A as diplomatic cover)
• Sumy buffer zone objective (weakens A, strengthens B/D)
• Reversible energy infrastructure pause (strengthens A, D)
Net: new instruments favour endurance posture, concentrate
risk on Trump relationship.

Historical anchors: Catherine's fiscal restraint preference
(military gains converted to diplomatic leverage under fiscal
exhaustion); Oreshnik Lviv strike Jan 9 (second operational
use); NWF December drawdown (1.22T roubles in one month);
Witkoff-Putin Moscow meeting Jan 22.

Session finding: On the two decision points where analytical
perspectives diverged, liability analysis predicted the actual
choice both times. New instruments since Jan 1 allow the
leadership to defer structural adjustment but do not resolve
the medium-term fiscal-temporal compression trap.

SESSION 004 — 10 February 2026
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
COUNSEL version: v1.6
News period: 6–10 February 2026
Topic: Current decision points + Iran deepening + "win on
the battlefield" reassessment

Decision points identified:
1. Alekseyev shooting response — intelligence matter or
   diplomatic instrument. [DAYS] [OPEN]
2. June deadline — take seriously or outlast. [WEEKS] [OPEN]
3. US-Iran talks — activate partnership or maintain verbal
   posture. [WEEKS] [OPEN]

Deepened: DP3 (Iran). Four options mapped (A: pre-strike
activation, B: conditional/private deterrent, C: verbal-only,
D: deliberate delay). Pre-mortem run on Option A — Trump
relationship collapse scenario mapped through March 2026.

User challenge: "win on the battlefield seems to be the best
option." Analysis revealed systematic gap — framework tracked
Russia's fiscal degradation curve but not Ukraine's manpower
degradation curve. Opponent constraints assessed:
• Ukraine manpower: BINDING NOW (50-60% brigade strength,
  2M draft evaders, 200k AWOL, 38-day rotations)
• Western support: DETERIORATING (US aid 97% reduction)
• Ukraine morale: STRESSED TO CRITICAL (systemic desertion)

Result: Option A confidence upgraded MODERATE → MODERATE-HIGH.
Binding constraint reframed as RELATIVE — attrition race
between Russia's fiscal curve and Ukraine's manpower curve.
Ukraine's curve assessed as steeper.

Historical anchors: Russian Imperial Army 1917 (morale
collapse before material exhaustion — applicable to opponent);
Alekseyev shooting (GRU deputy chief, Feb 6 — no precedent
at this seniority since conflict began).

Methodological finding: Entity-oriented COUNSEL framework
systematically underweights opponent degradation. Power
perspective must track relative position. New Section VI-B
added to CIV–COUNSEL–RUSSIA. Template fix recommended.

Session finding: "Win on the battlefield" is a real variant
of Option A, not only a narrative — because the opponent's
binding constraint (manpower) is binding sooner than Russia's
(fiscal base). The revealed preference hierarchy converges
with structural logic on this option, making it overdetermined.

Template fix applied: CIV–COUNSEL–TEMPLATE upgraded v1.5 → v1.6.
New mandatory Section IX-B (Opponent Constraint Assessment),
relative binding constraint rule, and two new completeness
audit items. Gap cannot recur in any civilisation's COUNSEL file.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
CUMULATIVE ARC — Sessions 001–004
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Key analytical products across all sessions:

VALIDATED DIAGNOSTIC:
  Revealed preference hierarchy: liability > structural >
  legitimacy. Tested on two divergent decisions (Jan 1 2026
  retrospective); liability predicted actual outcome both times.
  Strongest predictive tool for this leadership.

FRAMEWORK CORRECTIONS:
  • Opponent constraint assessment (Session 004) — Ukraine's
    manpower curve steeper than Russia's fiscal curve
  • Relative binding constraint reframing (Session 004) —
    Option A now tracks the race, not one side
  • Template fix (v1.6) — structural gap closed for all files

RECURRING DECISION POINTS:
  • Iran partnership activation — Sessions 002, 004 (DP3)
    (Recurs: leadership continues deferring)
  • Fiscal adjustment — Sessions 001 (DP1), 003 (DP3), 004 (DP2)
    (Recurs: same structural pressure, same deferral pattern)

OPEN DECISION POINTS (as of 10 February 2026):
  From Session 001: DP1 (fiscal cliff), DP2 (Abu Dhabi),
    DP3 (Syria bases) — all OPEN
  From Session 002: DP1 (S-400), DP2 (treaty activation),
    DP3 (uranium card) — all OPEN
  From Session 004: DP1 (Alekseyev), DP2 (June deadline),
    DP3 (Iran/US talks) — all OPEN
