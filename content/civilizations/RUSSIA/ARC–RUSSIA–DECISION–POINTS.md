────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
SESSION 001 — 10 February 2026
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
STATE version: v1.3
News period: 3–10 February 2026

Decision points identified:
1. Summer fiscal cliff — maintain war tempo (drain NWF) or
   adjust downward. [WEEKS] [OPEN]
2. Abu Dhabi negotiating space — signal territorial flexibility
   or hold maximalist position. [WEEKS] [OPEN]
3. Syria Mediterranean bases — pay concessions to retain
   Khmeimim/Tartous or accept contraction. [MONTHS] [OPEN]

Historical anchors: Catherine's fiscal restraint preference
(Panin-era alliance diplomacy under revenue constraint); the
1991 Soviet collapse (internal legitimacy failure despite
intact military capability).

Session finding: All three decisions exhibit structural-versus-
personal divergence. Structural logic favours adjustment;
personalist incentives predict the opposite. Window for
structurally rational choices estimated Q1–Q2 2026.

SESSION 002 — 10 February 2026
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
STATE version: v1.3
News period: 3–10 February 2026
Topic: Russia's perspective on Iran defence against US/Israel

Decision points identified:
1. Air defence acceleration — accelerate S-400 transfers to
   Iran or hold pace for Abu Dhabi. [WEEKS] [OPEN]
2. Strategic partnership treaty activation — signal commitment
   or maintain verbal-only posture. [WEEKS] [OPEN]
3. Uranium card — activate enriched uranium removal offer or
   hold. [MONTHS] [OPEN]

Deepened: DP1 (acceleration). Path A explored through 90-day
sequence and three scenarios. Fiscal cliff recalibrated:
liquidity constraint, not solvency (~20% debt-to-GDP).
Key finding: Midnight Hammer precedent predicts floor-level
response again despite structural logic favouring acceleration.

Historical anchors: Operation Midnight Hammer (June 2025 —
Russia's muted response to US strike on Iran); 1962 Cuba
crisis (arming partner vs needing adversary's cooperation).

Session finding: Abu Dhabi–Tehran tension is the governing
constraint; Midnight Hammer reveals this leadership resolves
it in favour of the US relationship over partnership credibility.

SESSION 003 — 10 February 2026
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
STATE version: v1.4
News period: Retrospective — 1 January 2026
Topic: Russia's critical decision points as of 1 January 2026

Decision points identified:
1. Abu Dhabi trilateral engagement — participate or hold
   position. [WEEKS] [RESOLVED: engaged Jan 22–25]
2. Oreshnik pricing — deterrent, bargaining chip, or
   ambiguous. [MONTHS] [RESOLVED: ambiguous + Lviv strike Jan 9]
3. Fiscal shock — absorb or adjust war economy.
   [WEEKS] [RESOLVED: partial adjust, 6.7% defence cut + record
   NWF drawdown]

Deepened: DP2 (Oreshnik pricing). Three options mapped (A:
maximum deterrent, B: explicit bargaining chip, C: ambiguous
pricing). Revealed preference diagnostic tested across all
three DPs.

Diagnostic test — revealed preference hierarchy:
• DP1: all three perspectives converged → untestable
• DP2: structural predicted B, legitimacy predicted A,
  liability predicted C → actual: C. Liability won.
• DP3: structural predicted full adjust, legitimacy predicted
  full absorb, liability predicted partial → actual: partial.
  Liability won.
Result: liability > structural > legitimacy on divergent DPs.

New instruments since Jan 1 (not available on that date):
• Trump personal-diplomacy channel (strengthens A, B near-term)
• Board of Peace proposal (strengthens A as diplomatic cover)
• Sumy buffer zone objective (weakens A, strengthens B/D)
• Reversible energy infrastructure pause (strengthens A, D)
Net: new instruments favour endurance posture, concentrate
risk on Trump relationship.

Historical anchors: Catherine's fiscal restraint preference
(military gains converted to diplomatic leverage under fiscal
exhaustion); Oreshnik Lviv strike Jan 9 (second operational
use); NWF December drawdown (1.22T roubles in one month);
Witkoff-Putin Moscow meeting Jan 22.

Session finding: On the two decision points where analytical
perspectives diverged, liability analysis predicted the actual
choice both times. New instruments since Jan 1 allow the
leadership to defer structural adjustment but do not resolve
the medium-term fiscal-temporal compression trap.

SESSION 004 — 10 February 2026
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
STATE version: v1.6
News period: 6–10 February 2026
Topic: Current decision points + Iran deepening + "win on
the battlefield" reassessment

Decision points identified:
1. Alekseyev shooting response — intelligence matter or
   diplomatic instrument. [DAYS] [OPEN]
2. June deadline — take seriously or outlast. [WEEKS] [OPEN]
3. US-Iran talks — activate partnership or maintain verbal
   posture. [WEEKS] [OPEN]

Deepened: DP3 (Iran). Four options mapped (A: pre-strike
activation, B: conditional/private deterrent, C: verbal-only,
D: deliberate delay). Pre-mortem run on Option A — Trump
relationship collapse scenario mapped through March 2026.

User challenge: "win on the battlefield seems to be the best
option." Analysis revealed systematic gap — framework tracked
Russia's fiscal degradation curve but not Ukraine's manpower
degradation curve. Opponent constraints assessed:
• Ukraine manpower: BINDING NOW (50-60% brigade strength,
  2M draft evaders, 200k AWOL, 38-day rotations)
• Western support: DETERIORATING (US aid 97% reduction)
• Ukraine morale: STRESSED TO CRITICAL (systemic desertion)

Result: Option A confidence upgraded MODERATE → MODERATE-HIGH.
Binding constraint reframed as RELATIVE — attrition race
between Russia's fiscal curve and Ukraine's manpower curve.
Ukraine's curve assessed as steeper.

Historical anchors: Russian Imperial Army 1917 (morale
collapse before material exhaustion — applicable to opponent);
Alekseyev shooting (GRU deputy chief, Feb 6 — no precedent
at this seniority since conflict began).

Methodological finding: Entity-oriented STATE framework
systematically underweights opponent degradation. Power
perspective must track relative position. New Section VI-B
added to CIV–STATE–RUSSIA. Template fix recommended.

Session finding: "Win on the battlefield" is a real variant
of Option A, not only a narrative — because the opponent's
binding constraint (manpower) is binding sooner than Russia's
(fiscal base). The revealed preference hierarchy converges
with structural logic on this option, making it overdetermined.

Template fix applied: CIV–STATE–TEMPLATE upgraded v1.5 → v1.6.
New mandatory Section IX-B (Opponent Constraint Assessment),
relative binding constraint rule, and two new completeness
audit items. Gap cannot recur in any civilisation's STATE file.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
SESSION 005 — 10 February 2026
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
STATE version: v1.6
Activity: Scenario Tree
Trigger: Ukrainian front-line collapse in a sector due to
manpower exhaustion.

Level 1 — 30-day horizon:
  A — Exploitation advance (MODERATE-HIGH): Russia exploits
    breach with available reserves, seeking to widen before
    reconstitution. Revealed-preference hierarchy predicts
    aggressive move. Parallel: Bagration 1944.
  B — Negotiate from peak (MODERATE): Leadership converts
    breakthrough to settlement leverage on maximalist terms.
    Fiscal-temporal compression trap makes this rational.
    Parallel: Catherine's diplomatic conversion under fiscal
    exhaustion.
  C — Overextension trap (LOW-MODERATE): Exploitation outpaces
    logistical capacity, creating a vulnerable salient. Labour
    deficit and stockpile constraints bind pace. Parallel:
    Kharkov 1942; Kyiv advance 2022.

Level 2 from A — 90-day horizon:
  A1 — Cascading front-line collapse (MODERATE): Sector-level
    breach triggers non-linear degradation across adjacent
    sectors. Brittle Ukrainian units at 50-60% strength break
    when front-line geometry changes. Parallel: Imperial Russian
    Army 1917.
  A2 — Consolidation ceiling (MODERATE-HIGH): Advance succeeds
    but hits structural ceiling (labour deficit, stockpile
    exhaustion, fiscal pressure). Gains limited to 30-50 km on
    single axis. Most probable sub-branch.
  A3 — Western intervention threshold (LOW): Visible collapse
    triggers direct Western military involvement. Low probability,
    high consequence. Parallel: Cuban Missile Crisis 1962.

Level 3 from A3 — 12-month horizon:
  A3.1 — Frozen intervention (MODERATE within branch): Western
    forces deploy to stabilisation line further west. Korea 1953
    template. Revealed-preference prediction: leadership takes
    this if available. Converges with Branch B and A2.
  A3.2 — Escalation spiral (LOW within branch): Deployment
    interpreted as encroachment; nuclear signalling escalates.
    Personal survival calculus may diverge from state survival.
    Parallel: Cuban Missile Crisis 1962.
  A3.3 — Intervention failure (LOW-MODERATE within branch):
    European deployment present but ineffective — too small to
    stabilise, too exposed to withdraw. Srebrenica/UNPROFOR
    template. Gravitates toward frozen conflict regardless.

CONVERGENCE ANALYSIS:
  Overdetermined outcome: Frozen conflict with Russian
  territorial gains. Appears across four independent paths
  (B, A2, A3.1, A3.3). Does not depend on which Level 1
  branch activates. Key variable: where the line freezes,
  not whether it freezes.

  Path-dependent outcomes (non-frozen):
  • A1 (cascading collapse) — transformative; produces
    territorial reconfiguration beyond frozen-conflict template
  • A3.2 (escalation spiral) — catastrophic; doubly gated
    (requires Western intervention + escalation management
    failure between nuclear powers)

  Decision-relevant finding: Assume frozen conflict as baseline.
  Focus analytical resources on: (1) where the line freezes
  (determines post-war territorial configuration), and
  (2) early-warning indicators distinguishing gradual stall
  (A2) from cascading collapse (A1) — adjacent-sector
  degradation rate, Ukrainian reserve deployment patterns,
  whether unit-level failures propagate or remain contained.

Historical anchors: Bagration 1944 (exploitation of front-line
breach); Imperial Russian Army 1917 (morale collapse / non-linear
degradation); Korean armistice 1953 (frozen conflict by external
stabilisation); Cuban Missile Crisis 1962 (escalation management
between nuclear powers); Srebrenica / UNPROFOR (intervention
failure); Catherine's fiscal restraint conversion (MEM–RUSSIA–
CATHERINE–GREAT, MEM–RUSSIA–PANIN); Kharkov 1942 / Kyiv 2022
(overextension).

Session finding: The trigger (front-line collapse from manpower
exhaustion) produces frozen conflict as an overdetermined outcome
across most branches. Only cascading collapse (A1, transformative)
and escalation spiral (A3.2, catastrophic) escape this attractor.
The scenario tree confirms that the relative degradation race
(Session 004 finding) is the governing variable — its pace and
manner determine which frozen-conflict variant activates.

SESSION 006 — 11 February 2026
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
STATE version: v1.6
News period: 4–11 February 2026
Activity: Decision Points (with three-source grounding)

MEMs loaded: WAR–NAPOLEON, BOLSHEVIK–REVOLUTION, BARBAROSSA,
CONGRESS–VIENNA, CATHERINE–GREAT, PANIN, WAR–CRIMEAN, NICHOLAS–II

Decision points identified:
1. Defence budget cut — real fiscal adjustment or repackaging?
   13.5T → 12.6T roubles (first cut since war began); security
   forces UP, propaganda UP 1.5x, military compensation DOWN.
   Record 2025 deficit (5.65T). VAT increase proposed.
   [WEEKS] [OPEN]
2. June deadline — engage or outlast? Trump set deadline;
   Istanbul talks exchanged road maps; Abu Dhabi showed no
   compromise on territory. Three options mapped:
   A — Engage (Panin logic: convert gains to treaty structure)
   B — Outlast (Potemkin logic: keep taking territory)
   C — Engage to outlast (Nicholas II Duma precedent: perform
       engagement without structural commitment)
   [WEEKS] [OPEN]
3. Alekseyev shooting — intelligence matter or diplomatic
   instrument? GRU deputy chief shot Feb 6, survived; suspects
   identified; Russia blames Ukraine. Lavrov frames as
   "disrupting peace." [DAYS] [OPEN]

Deepened: DP2 (June deadline). Three options mapped. Current
policy assessed as Option C (engage to outlast) based on:
Istanbul participation without positional movement, budget
repackaging, Alekseyev instrumentalisation. Revealed-preference
hierarchy predicts C (minimises personal exposure on both flanks).
Nicholas II Duma precedent: "reform conceded tactically, not
integrated structurally" producing "legitimacy half-life."

Discriminating signals mapped:
  C → A (genuine engagement): territorial flexibility language,
    delegation upgrade to principals, fiscal demobilisation
    signals, ceasefire offer with specific terms
  C → B (open defiance): major offensive escalation timed to
    diplomatic window, third Oreshnik deployment, explicit
    rejection of June timeline, Trump relationship rupture

Historical anchors: Treaty of Paris 1856 (fiscal adjustment
after defeat — MEM–RUSSIA–WAR–CRIMEAN); Congress of Vienna
sacrifice-to-authority conversion (MEM–RUSSIA–CONGRESS–VIENNA);
Panin's equilibrium diplomacy vs Catherine's territorial lock-in
(MEM–RUSSIA–PANIN, MEM–RUSSIA–CATHERINE–GREAT); Nicholas II
Duma as tactical concession (MEM–RUSSIA–NICHOLAS–II); 1917
non-linear morale collapse (MEM–RUSSIA–BOLSHEVIK–REVOLUTION).

Session finding: Current policy fits Option C (diplomatic
performance without commitment) across all three decision points.
The defence budget repackages rather than adjusts; the June
process is entered without positional movement; the Alekseyev
shooting is instrumentalised for diplomatic framing. The
revealed-preference hierarchy (liability > structural >
legitimacy) predicts this configuration. The binding question
is not what the leadership chooses but what forces a transition
from C to A or B — fiscal curve failure forces A; battlefield
breakthrough forces B.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
CUMULATIVE ARC — Sessions 001–006
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Key analytical products across all sessions:

VALIDATED DIAGNOSTIC:
  Revealed preference hierarchy: liability > structural >
  legitimacy. Tested on two divergent decisions (Jan 1 2026
  retrospective); liability predicted actual outcome both times.
  Strongest predictive tool for this leadership.

FRAMEWORK CORRECTIONS:
  • Opponent constraint assessment (Session 004) — Ukraine's
    manpower curve steeper than Russia's fiscal curve
  • Relative binding constraint reframing (Session 004) —
    Option A now tracks the race, not one side
  • Template fix (v1.6) — structural gap closed for all files

SCENARIO TREE (Session 005):
  Trigger: front-line collapse from manpower exhaustion.
  Overdetermined outcome: frozen conflict with Russian
  territorial gains (appears across 4 of 6 terminal branches).
  Path-dependent exceptions: cascading collapse (transformative),
  escalation spiral (catastrophic). Governing variable: relative
  degradation race pace and manner. Confirms Session 004 finding
  that the relative binding constraint is the primary analytical
  frame.

RECURRING DECISION POINTS:
  • Iran partnership activation — Sessions 002, 004 (DP3)
    (Recurs: leadership continues deferring)
  • Fiscal adjustment — Sessions 001 (DP1), 003 (DP3), 004 (DP2),
    006 (DP1) (Recurs: same structural pressure; now manifesting
    in actual budget numbers; repackaging pattern confirmed)
  • June deadline — Sessions 004 (DP2), 006 (DP2)
    (Recurs: Option C assessed as current policy)

NEW ANALYTICAL PRODUCT (Session 006):
  Option C identification: "engage to outlast" as a distinct
  strategic mode — diplomatic performance without structural
  commitment. Nicholas II Duma precedent. Discriminating signals
  mapped for transitions C→A and C→B. Binding question reframed:
  not what the leadership chooses but what forces a transition.

OPEN DECISION POINTS (as of 11 February 2026):
  From Session 001: DP1 (fiscal cliff), DP2 (Abu Dhabi),
    DP3 (Syria bases) — all OPEN
  From Session 002: DP1 (S-400), DP2 (treaty activation),
    DP3 (uranium card) — all OPEN
  From Session 004: DP1 (Alekseyev), DP3 (Iran/US talks) — OPEN
  From Session 006: DP1 (budget repackaging), DP2 (June deadline
    — Option C), DP3 (Alekseyev instrumentalisation) — all OPEN
