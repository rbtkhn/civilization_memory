I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves the Iron Curtain as **the metaphor and reality
of Soviet-bloc division**: the term popularized by Churchill (1946)
for the boundary between Soviet-dominated Eastern Europe and the
West, and the border regime—physical, ideological, and informational—
that made that division concrete.

For Russian civilizational memory, the Iron Curtain encodes **Soviet
security as enclosure**—the bloc as buffer and sphere, sealed against
Western influence and flight.

This MEM does NOT resolve:
• Whether the Curtain was defensive necessity or imperial control
• Whether it preserved peace or prolonged oppression

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. ORIGIN OF THE TERM: CHURCHILL (1946)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
On March 5, 1946, at Westminster College in Fulton, Missouri,
Churchill declared:

"From Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic, an iron
curtain has descended across the Continent. Behind that line lie
all the capitals of the ancient states of Central and Eastern
Europe. Warsaw, Berlin, Prague, Vienna, Budapest, Belgrade,
Bucharest and Sofia, all these famous cities and the populations
around them lie in what I must call the Soviet sphere, and all are
subject in one form or another, not only to Soviet influence but
to a very high and, in many cases, increasing measure of control
from Moscow."

The speech framed the post-war order as **division**, not cooperation.
Soviet response: Churchill was warmongering; the USSR had security
interests and had liberated those territories. The term stuck: **Iron
Curtain** became shorthand for the Cold War divide.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. THE CURTAIN AS REALITY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Iron Curtain was not only metaphor but border regime.

Physical dimension:
• Heavily guarded borders between Soviet bloc and West (Germany,
  Austria, Finland, Turkey, Iran)
• Berlin Wall (1961) as the Curtain's most visible segment
• Fences, watchtowers, minefields, shoot-to-kill
• Restricted movement: exit from the bloc was controlled or forbidden

Ideological dimension:
• Censorship; limited Western media and travel
• Socialist realism; party control of culture
• "Peace" and "anti-imperialism" as official narrative; Western
  "aggression" as threat

Informational dimension:
• Jamming of Western broadcasts (where possible)
• Closed societies; limited contact across the Curtain
• Defection and flight as betrayal; those who left were "traitors"
  in Soviet discourse

The Curtain was **Soviet sphere sealed**. MEM–RUSSIA–USSR–BERLIN–WALL
records its most iconic segment; this MEM records the **concept and
system**.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. SOVIET PERSPECTIVE: SECURITY AND SPHERE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
From Moscow's standpoint, the Curtain was **defensive**.

Soviet framing:
• Buffer against Western invasion (twice in thirty years: 1914–17,
  1941–45)
• Ideological quarantine: capitalism and "bourgeois" influence must
  not penetrate
• Control of Eastern Europe as guarantee of security
• The Curtain protected the gains of the Great Patriotic War

The Mercouris reading would stress legitimacy and institutional
continuity: the USSR saw itself as entitled to a sphere; the Curtain
was the expression of that entitlement. The Mearsheimer reading would
stress power: the Red Army had occupied Eastern Europe; the Curtain
was the maintenance of that occupation by other means. Both capture
truth; tension preserved.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. THE CURTAIN'S END
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Iron Curtain lifted when the bloc could no longer be sustained.

1989:
• Gorbachev's refusal to use force in Eastern Europe
• Fall of Berlin Wall; opening of borders (Hungary, Czechoslovakia,
  GDR)
• Revolutions in Warsaw, Prague, Berlin, Bucharest, Sofia
• Soviet troops did not intervene
• By 1991 the Curtain was gone—the USSR itself was dissolving

The Curtain had required **Soviet will and capacity** to enforce.
When that will lapsed (Gorbachev) and capacity was strained (economic
failure, legitimacy deficit), the Curtain fell. MEM–RUSSIA–GORBACHEV
and MEM–RUSSIA–USSR–COLD–WAR record the terminal phase.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Iron Curtain encodes:

• Division was the condition of Soviet security in Europe—buffer
  and sphere sealed.
• The Curtain was both metaphor (Churchill) and system (borders,
  ideology, information).
• Its fall in 1989 was the visible end of Soviet hegemony in Eastern
  Europe.
• For Russian memory, the Curtain can be read as necessary defence
  or as oppressive enclosure; both readings persist.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Metaphors shape policy; "Iron Curtain" named and reinforced the divide.
• Sealed borders require continuous enforcement; they do not hold
  by consent alone.
• When the center no longer enforces, the Curtain collapses.
