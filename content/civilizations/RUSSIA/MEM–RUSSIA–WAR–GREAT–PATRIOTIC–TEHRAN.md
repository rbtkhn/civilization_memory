I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves the Tehran Conference as **the moment the
Big Three aligned**: the first meeting of Stalin, Roosevelt,
and Churchill that coordinated the final destruction of Nazi
Germany and began sketching the post-war world.

For Russian civilizational memory, Tehran is **recognition**.

At Tehran, the Western powers acknowledged that the Soviet Union
would be a co-equal architect of the post-war order—that the
27 million dead entitled Russia to a seat at the table of great
powers.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. STRATEGIC CONTEXT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
November 1943 situation:

Eastern Front:
• Kursk victory (July-August 1943)
• Soviet forces advancing westward
• Initiative permanently with USSR
• Germany on strategic defensive

Western Allies:
• Italy invaded (September 1943)
• No second front in France yet
• Strategic bombing ongoing
• Cross-Channel invasion planned for 1944

The conference occurred when Soviet military contribution was
undeniable and Western forces had not yet landed in France.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. THE MEETING
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tehran was the first Big Three summit.

Participants:
• Joseph Stalin (USSR)
• Franklin D. Roosevelt (USA)
• Winston Churchill (UK)

Location: Soviet Embassy, Tehran, Iran
Duration: Four days of plenary sessions and bilaterals

Stalin's position:
• Demanded second front in France (not Mediterranean)
• Sought recognition of Soviet security needs
• Required coordination of offensives
• Tested Western commitment to alliance

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III.A REALIST SHARPENING: BARGAINING POSITION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Mercouris reading frames Tehran as alliance solidarity—
the three great powers uniting to defeat fascism, differences
set aside for common cause.

The realist sharpening adds: Tehran was power negotiation.

Stalin's leverage:
• Soviet forces doing the dying (80%+ of German casualties)
• No Western troops in France yet
• Soviet Union could theoretically seek separate peace
• Western need for continued Soviet engagement

Roosevelt's calculation:
• Required Soviet entry into Pacific war
• Sought post-war cooperation
• Willing to accommodate Soviet security concerns
• Distanced from Churchill's imperial concerns

Churchill's position:
• Preferred Mediterranean strategy (peripheral approach)
• Concerned about Soviet post-war power
• Overruled by Roosevelt-Stalin alignment
• British influence declining relative to superpowers

The structural insight: sacrifice translated to bargaining power.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. SECOND FRONT COMMITMENT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The central Soviet demand was met.

Stalin's insistence:
• Mediterranean operations were diversions
• Only cross-Channel invasion would relieve Eastern Front
• 1944 was the deadline

Roosevelt's agreement:
• Overlord confirmed for May 1944
• Southern France operation (Anvil) added
• Mediterranean made secondary
• Churchill's alternatives rejected

This was **Soviet strategic victory in diplomacy**.

The Western Allies committed to the operation Stalin demanded,
on the timeline Stalin required.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. POLAND
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Poland's future was discussed but not resolved.

Soviet position:
• Curzon Line as eastern border (1920 proposal)
• Poland compensated from German territory in west
• Pro-Soviet government required
• London Poles rejected

Western position:
• Ambiguous support for London government-in-exile
• Unwilling to confront Stalin directly
• Deferred hard decisions to later conferences
• Poland's eastern territories effectively conceded

Tehran established the pattern: Western powers would not
fight Stalin over Eastern Europe.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. GERMANY'S FUTURE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The conference discussed post-war Germany.

Points of agreement:
• Unconditional surrender required
• Germany to be disarmed
• War criminals to be punished
• Some form of occupation

Points left unresolved:
• Partition vs unification
• Reparations amount and form
• Occupation zones (discussed but not finalized)
• Long-term political status

Germany's destruction was agreed; Germany's future was deferred.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. SOVIET ENTRY AGAINST JAPAN
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Stalin committed to enter the Pacific war.

Agreement:
• USSR would attack Japan after Germany's defeat
• Timing: approximately three months after V-E Day
• Conditions to be negotiated (territorial compensation)

This was major American objective—Soviet forces would
fix Japanese armies in Manchuria, reducing American casualties.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII.A POLYPHONIC TENSION: ALLIANCE VS SPHERES
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Mercouris reading frames Tehran as high point of Grand
Alliance—three leaders cooperating to defeat common enemy,
building foundation for post-war peace.

The realist sharpening adds: Tehran divided the world.

• Mercouris: The alliance represented genuine cooperation;
  the leaders sought lasting peace; differences were manageable
• Mearsheimer: Tehran was sphere-of-influence bargaining;
  Eastern Europe was effectively conceded to Stalin; Roosevelt
  believed he could "manage" Stalin through personal diplomacy

The conference produced both:
• Genuine military coordination (Overlord commitment)
• Implicit territorial division (Poland, Eastern Europe)

George Kennan later observed:

"At Tehran, the Western powers made clear that they would not
oppose Soviet domination of Eastern Europe by force. This was
not stated explicitly—it rarely is—but the pattern was set.
Poland's eastern border was conceded, and with it the principle
that military occupation would determine political control."
— George F. Kennan, *Memoirs: 1925–1950* (1967)

Tension preserved without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VIII. LEGITIMACY HARVEST
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tehran delivered legitimacy to Stalin.

Recognition achieved:
• Co-equal status with Western powers
• Photographs of the Big Three (Stalin at center)
• Soviet security concerns acknowledged
• Post-war role confirmed

The conference demonstrated that Soviet sacrifice had purchased
a seat at the great-power table.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IX. CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tehran encodes:

• Sacrifice translates to diplomatic power
• Military contribution determines conference position
• Second front was extracted through Soviet pressure
• Eastern Europe was implicitly conceded
• Great-power status requires great-power recognition
• Alliance solidarity and sphere division coexist

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
X. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Wartime alliance is also wartime bargaining.
• Military burden determines diplomatic weight.
• Implicit concessions matter as much as explicit agreements.
• Personal diplomacy does not override power realities.
• Post-war order is shaped during war, not after.
• Recognition of status is itself a war objective.

POLYPHONIC TENSIONS (v2.0):
• MERCOURIS: Grand Alliance solidarity → united against fascism
• MEARSHEIMER: Power negotiation → sphere-of-influence bargaining
• MERCOURIS: Overlord commitment as cooperation → shared victory
• MEARSHEIMER: Overlord commitment as concession → Soviet pressure worked
• Both: Tehran shaped the post-war world before the war ended

Tension preserved without verdict.
