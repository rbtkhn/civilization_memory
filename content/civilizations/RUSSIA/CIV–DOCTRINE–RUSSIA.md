UPGRADE NOTE (v3.4) — DOCTRINE 07
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Scholar WRITE mode (LEARN session 2026-02, cross-civilisational
comparative analysis):

• DOCTRINE 07 (CORRECTION MECHANISM ABSENCE): New doctrine. Encodes
  the finding that Russian autocracy lacks an institutionalised mechanism
  for correcting sovereign dysfunction from within the elite. DOCTRINE 02
  describes buffer-based shock absorption; DOCTRINE 07 identifies the
  gap when the sovereign *is* the shock. Cross-civilisational evidence:
  Rome's Praetorian correction (Caligula 41 AD — ad hoc, succeeded),
  Ottoman Janissary corrections (1622–1807 — institutionalised, succeeded
  repeatedly), Russian generals' abdication advice (Nicholas II 1917 —
  improvised, failed). Source: MEM–RUSSIA–NICHOLAS–II,

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Scholar WRITE mode (STATE session 2026-02, ARC-sourced doctrine check):

• DOCTRINE 02: Added decision-quality distortion mechanism — unbuffered
  personalism causes decisions to optimise for the leader's survival
  horizon rather than the state's structural interest. Added Hard
  Constraint: elimination of competing advisory voices degrades decision
  quality. Source: MEM–RUSSIA–PANIN, CIV–STATE–RUSSIA v1.7 Section III.C.

• DOCTRINE 04: Added purge-redistribution failure mode — dismantling an
  institutional bloc and redistributing rents produces factional
  competition, not cohesion, even under active survival framing. Added
  Hard Constraint: purge-redistribution without institutional
  reabsorption triggers factional competition. Source: ARC-sourced
  doctrine check Feb 2026; Carnegie Politika (ARC E/RESEARCH); Meduza
  (ARC E/NEWS).

• DOCTRINE 06 (FISCAL-PERSONALIST INCOHERENCE): New doctrine. Captures
  the interaction between DOCTRINE 02 and DOCTRINE 05 under current
  conditions — fiscal pressure demands settlement while personalist
  structure resists it, producing diplomatic engagement without binding
  commitment. Source: CIV–STATE–RUSSIA v1.7 Section VII; ARC-sourced

UPGRADE NOTE (v3.1) — REFINEMENT PASS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Scholar WRITE mode analyzed DOCTRINE–RUSSIA against CIV–SCHOLAR–RUSSIA
and CIV–CORE–RUSSIA. Refinements applied:

• DOCTRINE 01: Scope added—applies under external pressure or crisis;
  peacetime endurance claims require separate validation (RLL–RUSSIA–0009, 0011).
• DOCTRINE 02: "Time-of-Troubles" → "Time of Troubles" (MEM naming).
  Operational Meaning: buffers clarified to include corridor-control capacity (RLL–RUSSIA–0001).
• DOCTRINE 03: RB/CB/FB/SB spelled out and tied to CIV–CORE–RUSSIA VIII.

No doctrine numbers, names, or acceptance status changed. Definitions
and Hard Constraints refined for alignment only.

• DOCTRINE 04 (ELITE CAPACITY BOUND) proposed from RLL–RUSSIA–0010;
  DIB–RUSSIA approved; Status: ACCEPTED · LOCKED · CANONICAL.

II. DOCTRINE REGISTRY (AUTHORITATIVE)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

DOCTRINE 01
Name: ENDURANCE THROUGH COMPRESSION
Status: ACCEPTED · LOCKED · CANONICAL
Source:
• CIV–SCHOLAR–RUSSIA (SYNTHESIS 0001)
• DIB–RUSSIA (Approved)

Definition:
Russian power endures not through flexibility or reform, but through
compression under pressure. External coercion, invasion, or isolation
forces internal consolidation, hierarchy tightening, and resource
prioritization, enabling survival where more open systems fracture.

Scope: Applies under external pressure or crisis; peacetime endurance
claims require separate validation (CIV–SCHOLAR–RUSSIA RLL–RUSSIA–0009, 0011).

Operational Meaning:
• Pressure is metabolized, not avoided
• Crisis strengthens central authority
• Attrition favors systems with replacement depth

Hard Constraints:
• Compression fails if elite cohesion fractures
• Compression accelerates collapse if legitimacy decays faster than order
• Endurance is invalid if replacement < burn-rate

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

DOCTRINE 02
Name: BUFFERED AUTOCRACY
Status: ACCEPTED · LOCKED · CANONICAL
Source:
• CIV–SCHOLAR–RUSSIA (SYNTHESIS 0003)
• DIB–RUSSIA (Approved)

Definition:
Autocracy sustains Russian state power only when buffered by institutions,
ritual legitimacy, and administrative continuity. Unbuffered personalism
amplifies short-term power but accelerates elite destruction and systemic
failure.

Operational Meaning:
• Central authority is necessary but insufficient
• Institutions absorb shocks the ruler cannot
• Buffers include institutional, ritual, and corridor-control capacity (RLL–RUSSIA–0001)
• Terror without buffers shortens regime lifespan
• Decision-quality distortion: unbuffered personalism causes decisions
  to optimise for the leader's survival horizon rather than the state's
  structural interest. The divergence is invisible when leader and state
  interests align (external threat, early consolidation) and acute when
  they diverge (fiscal stress, settlement negotiations). Historical
  precedent: Catherine's operational quartet (Panin–Potemkin) produced
  better decisions through faction competition; when competing voices
  were eliminated (Panin's death 1783, Potemkin's death 1791),
  strategic quality declined.
  (Source: MEM–RUSSIA–PANIN, CIV–STATE–RUSSIA v1.7 Section III.C)

Hard Constraints:
• Personal rule without buffers triggers Time of Troubles dynamics
• Excess coercion degrades replacement capacity
• Autocracy must be structural, not charismatic
• Elimination of competing advisory voices degrades decision quality —
  the system loses the information generated by factional competition
  (cf. Catherine's arbiter position; MEM–RUSSIA–PANIN VI-A)

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

DOCTRINE 03
Name: SYMBOLIC LEGITIMACY WITH STRUCTURAL LIMITS
Status: ACCEPTED · LOCKED · CANONICAL
Source:
• CIV–SCHOLAR–RUSSIA (SYNTHESIS 0004)
• DIB–RUSSIA (Approved)

Definition:
Russian legitimacy can be sustained symbolically—through history,
sacral authority, and civilizational mission—but only within strict
structural limits. Symbolism cannot substitute for throughput, cohesion,
or replacement depth.

Operational Meaning:
• Myth stabilizes endurance but cannot create capacity
• Narrative power delays collapse; it does not prevent it
• Symbolic inheritance must map onto material control
• **Institutional legitimacy mode:** Legitimacy through treaties,
  alliances, and system participation. Structural condition: Russia's
  relative power makes it rational for others to grant recognition.
  Depends on systemic recognition and prior coercive credibility.
  Fails when (a) power distribution no longer makes Russian
  participation advantageous for others, (b) recognition erodes
  (e.g. balancing coalition forms), or (c) coercive credibility
  cannot be demonstrated.
• **Territorial legitimacy mode:** Legitimacy through conquest and
  spatial control. Structural condition: Control is militarily and
  administratively sustainable and costly for others to reverse.
  Depends on durable control and material throughput. Fails when
  (a) control is contested and force ratios turn adverse,
  (b) throughput or replacement depth break down, or (c) the cost
  of holding exceeds the value gained.
• **Mode tension:** Regimes may rely on either or both modes. Neither
  substitutes for structural fundamentals (throughput, cohesion,
  replacement depth per DOCTRINE 03 Hard Constraints). Institutional
  legitimacy rests on power distribution and others' incentives to
  cooperate; territorial legitimacy on enforceable control and
  capacity to sustain it.

Hard Constraints:
• Symbolism fails if economic or military systems break
• Myth without performance accelerates legitimacy shock
• Narrative cannot override RB/CB/FB/SB constraints (replacement-burn,
  cohesion, force/friction, settlement-binding; CIV–CORE–RUSSIA VIII)
• Institutional legitimacy fails when power distribution no longer
  makes Russian participation advantageous for others
• Territorial legitimacy fails when control cannot be sustained or
  when the cost of sustaining it outweighs the benefit

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

DOCTRINE 04
Name: ELITE CAPACITY BOUND
Status: ACCEPTED · LOCKED · CANONICAL
Source:
• CIV–SCHOLAR–RUSSIA (RLL–RUSSIA–0010 — Elite Overproduction → Instability Binding)
• DIB–RUSSIA (Approved)

Definition:
Russia consistently produces more elites than its political economy can
absorb. Expanding legitimacy mechanisms without survival compression
increases internal fragmentation; suppressing elites outright risks
rebellion. Stability requires subordinating elite claims to survival
imperatives through war or emergency.

Operational Meaning:
• Elite expansion must be bounded by absorption capacity
• Legitimacy expansion increases fragmentation unless compressed by
  survival imperative (RLL–RUSSIA–0011)
• War or emergency subordinates elites to usefulness, not legitimacy
• Purge-redistribution cycles can produce factional competition rather
  than cohesion, even under active survival framing. When suppression
  dismantles an institutional bloc (e.g. a ministerial network) and
  redistributes its rent flows, rival factions compete for the captured
  resources. Survival framing subordinates elite *claims* but does not
  prevent *jockeying* for redistributed rents. Historical precedent:
  Defence Ministry purge 2024–2025 dismantled the Shoigu network; rents
  redistributed across rival elite groups; Carnegie and Meduza
  independently report a "perform loyalty / undermine rivals" dynamic.
  (Source: ARC-sourced doctrine check Feb 2026; Carnegie Politika
  ARC E/RESEARCH; Meduza ARC E/NEWS)

Hard Constraints:
• Unbounded elite expansion without survival compression triggers
  fragmentation
• Suppression without survival framing risks rebellion
• Elite claims must be subordinated to survival imperatives when
  cohesion is at risk (RLL–RUSSIA–0010)
• Purge-redistribution without institutional reabsorption triggers
  factional competition, not cohesion — even under active survival
  framing

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

DOCTRINE 05
Name: FISCAL CONSTRAINT AND RESTRAINT PREFERENCE
Status: ACCEPTED · LOCKED · CANONICAL
Source:
• CIV–SCHOLAR–RUSSIA (LEARN session 2026-02; Panin foreign policy
  quantitative analysis)
• MEM–RUSSIA–PANIN, MEM–RUSSIA–CATHERINE–GREAT
• DIB–RUSSIA (Approved via WRITE-mode implementation)

Definition:
When per capita extraction is low and war costs consume a large share
of revenue, alliance-based restraint is structurally favored over
unilateral conquest. Diplomacy conserves fiscal capacity; war exhausts
it. Exceptions arise when territorial expansion promises clear,
medium-term fiscal returns (e.g. trade, customs, tribute) that justify
upfront cost.

Operational Meaning:
• Low per capita extraction favors restraint over war when war cost
  is high relative to revenue
• Alliance maintenance is cheaper than war; restraint is instrumentally
  rational under fiscal constraint
• Territorial expansion is attractive when projected returns
  (e.g. Crimea model) offer calculable payback within a decade or so
• Fiscal constraint favors restraint, but also makes fiscally
  self-sustaining conquest attractive when available

Hard Constraints:
• Restraint preference fails when war is funded externally
  (subsidies, plunder) or when fiscal structure changes
• Expansion preference fails when conquest cost exceeds returns or
  when payback horizon is too long
• Neither preference overrides RB/CB/FB/SB constraints
  (CIV–CORE–RUSSIA VIII)

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

DOCTRINE 06
Name: FISCAL-PERSONALIST INCOHERENCE
Status: ACCEPTED · LOCKED · CANONICAL
Source:
• CIV–STATE–RUSSIA v1.7 Section VII (Doctrine Interaction —
  Fiscal vs Personalist Incoherence pattern)
• ARC-sourced doctrine check (February 2026)
• DOCTRINE 02 (BUFFERED AUTOCRACY), DOCTRINE 05 (FISCAL CONSTRAINT
  AND RESTRAINT PREFERENCE)
• DIB–RUSSIA (Approved via WRITE-mode implementation)

Definition:
When fiscal constraint intensifies under personalist governance, the
system generates structurally contradictory behaviour: fiscal logic
demands restraint and settlement, while personalist logic prevents
acceptance of any outcome frameable as the leader's failure. The system
engages diplomatically (to manage external relationships and buy fiscal
time) while making no binding commitments (because concession is
personally dangerous). This produces diplomatic performance without
structural commitment.

Operational Meaning:
• Fiscal pressure and personalist liability pull in opposite directions
• The system participates in negotiations to manage relationships, not
  to reach outcomes
• Diplomatic engagement without binding commitment is the observable
  signature of the incoherence
• The incoherence is not strategic ambiguity — it is the product of two
  doctrinal forces (DOCTRINE 02, DOCTRINE 05) pulling in opposite
  directions within the same system
• Historical precedent: Nicholas II's Duma concession (1905) — reform
  conceded tactically under fiscal/military stress, never integrated
  structurally; the "Engage to Outlast" pattern
  (CIV–STATE–RUSSIA v1.7 Section VII)

Hard Constraints:
• Incoherence resolves when one force overwhelms the other: fiscal
  collapse forces genuine concession; or external channel loss is
  accepted rather than frameable defeat
• The system cannot sustain incoherence indefinitely — either the fiscal
  base breaks or the diplomatic framework collapses
• Resolution direction is the discriminating signal: genuine fiscal
  concession (territorial flexibility, binding ceasefire terms) means
  DOCTRINE 05 has overridden DOCTRINE 02; sacrifice of a diplomatic
  channel rather than acceptance of frameable defeat means DOCTRINE 02
  has overridden DOCTRINE 05

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

DOCTRINE 07
Name: CORRECTION MECHANISM ABSENCE
Status: ACCEPTED · LOCKED · CANONICAL
Source:
• CIV–SCHOLAR–RUSSIA (LEARN session 2026-02; cross-civilisational
  comparative analysis — Rome, Ottoman, Russia)
• MEM–RUSSIA–NICHOLAS–II, MEM–ROME–EMPIRE–CALIGULA,
  MEM–ROME–OTTOMAN–EMPIRE
• DOCTRINE 02 (BUFFERED AUTOCRACY)
• DIB–RUSSIA (Approved via WRITE-mode implementation)

Definition:
Russian autocracy lacks an institutionalised mechanism for correcting
sovereign dysfunction from within the elite. Buffers (DOCTRINE 02) absorb
shocks the ruler cannot, but they do not remove or replace a ruler whose
personal behaviour degrades the system. Where other civilisations developed
correction functions — Rome's ad hoc Praetorian intervention, the Ottoman
Janissary corps' institutionalised sultan replacement — Russian civilisational
grammar contains no equivalent. Elite correction, when it occurs (1917,
1964), is improvised, late, and typically insufficient to preserve the
institutional framework beneath the sovereign.

Operational Meaning:
• Buffered autocracy (DOCTRINE 02) describes shock absorption; this
  doctrine describes the absence of a correction function when the
  sovereign *is* the shock
• Russian elite self-policing is improvised and ad hoc, not
  institutionalised — each correction event is treated as unprecedented
  rather than procedural
• The absence means sovereign dysfunction runs until external system
  failure (war, fiscal collapse, mass revolt) forces resolution —
  correction arrives too late to preserve institutional depth
• Cross-civilisational evidence: Rome's Praetorian correction under
  Caligula (41 AD) succeeded because institutional depth survived beneath
  the personal dysfunction; Ottoman Janissary corrections succeeded
  repeatedly (1622, 1648, 1703, 1807) because the correcting body had
  no dynastic stake (devshirme separation); Russian generals' abdication
  advice to Nicholas II (February 1917) failed because twelve years of
  fiscal-personalist incoherence had already exhausted the institutional
  depth beneath the sovereign
• The moral dimension compounds the structural: prolonged incoherence
  erodes not merely institutional trust but the sense that loyalty is
  honourable, accelerating elite defection beyond the point where
  correction can save the system

Hard Constraints:
• Without a correction mechanism, DOCTRINE 02's buffer function is
  one-directional — buffers can absorb external shocks but cannot
  correct internal sovereign dysfunction
• Improvised correction arrives only after institutional depth is
  already degraded — the correction and the collapse occur simultaneously
  rather than sequentially
• Any future institutionalisation of a correction mechanism (e.g.
  constitutional constraint, elite council with removal authority)
  would fundamentally alter DOCTRINE 02's operational logic — this
  has not occurred in the Russian civilisational record
