Applied requirements: PRIMARY N/A, CONTEXTUAL ≥2, SECONDARY ≥5, CRITICAL ≥3

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves Mikhail Gorbachev as **the reformer who
unintentionally dissolved the Soviet Union**: the leader who sought
to save the system through glasnost and perestroika and instead
unleashed forces that destroyed it.

For Russian civilizational memory, Gorbachev represents **reform
as dissolution**—the paradox that opening and restructuring,
intended to preserve the state, revealed its illegitimacy and
enabled its collapse.

This MEM does NOT resolve:
• Whether the Soviet Union could have been reformed and preserved
• Whether Gorbachev's choices accelerated or merely revealed collapse
• Whether he was tragic reformer or naive dismantler

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. ASCENT AND CONTEXT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Gorbachev rose within the Communist Party under Brezhnev and
Andropov.

Formative context:
• Stavropol region; agriculture and party work
• Andropov's patronage; exposure to reformist ideas
• Recognition of economic stagnation and technological gap
• Belief that the system could be renewed, not replaced

He became General Secretary in March 1985, aged 54—the first
post-Stalin leader from a new generation, promising dynamism
after years of gerontocratic rule.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. GLASNOST AND PERESTROIKA
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Gorbachev launched two overlapping reforms.

Glasnost (openness):
• Relaxation of censorship and public discussion
• Acknowledgment of Stalinist crimes and stagnation
• Emergence of critical media and civil society
• Nationalist sentiments in republics surfaced

Perestroika (restructuring):
• Economic reform: limited market mechanisms, enterprise autonomy
• Political reform: contested elections, reduced party monopoly
• Intended to make the system efficient and legitimate
• Disrupted planning without replacing it with a stable alternative

Archie Brown describes the dynamic:

"The Brezhnev era was stability purchased at the cost of reform. The
leadership refused to adapt, preferring predictability to innovation.
The economy stagnated because prices were not allowed to signal scarcity,
because enterprises were rewarded for meeting plans rather than satisfying
consumers, because the system punished initiative. By 1985, the Soviet
Union was an ossified structure—too rigid to adapt, too powerful to
collapse quickly, but visibly failing."
— Archie Brown, *The Gorbachev Factor* (1996)

Gorbachev attempted to adapt; the attempt **destabilized** the structure.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. END OF THE COLD WAR
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Gorbachev's foreign policy transformed superpower relations.

Key moves:
• Withdrawal from Afghanistan (1989)
• Acceptance of Eastern European independence (1989)
• Summit diplomacy with Reagan and Bush
• Nuclear arms reduction (INF, START)
• "New thinking" — common security, reduced confrontation

The Cold War ended without hot war. Soviet retreat from empire was
voluntary in the sense that Gorbachev chose not to use force to
hold Eastern Europe or to escalate abroad. For the West, this was
triumph; for many in Russia, it was **retreat and loss of status**.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. COLLAPSE: 1989–1991
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Soviet Union dissolved from within.

Serhii Plokhy describes the end:

"The Soviet Union did not collapse from external pressure—it dissolved
from within. Gorbachev's reforms, intended to save the system, destroyed
it. Glasnost revealed the lies on which the system rested; perestroika
disrupted the planning mechanisms without replacing them. The nationalist
movements in the republics—enabled by the federal structure—provided
the mechanism for dissolution. When the August coup failed, the center
had no authority left. The republics walked away."
— Serhii Plokhy, *The Last Empire* (2014)

Sequence:
• 1989: Eastern European revolutions; Berlin Wall falls
• 1990: Baltic independence movements; sovereignty declarations
• August 1991: Coup attempt against Gorbachev; failure
• December 1991: Belovezha Accords; Gorbachev resigns; USSR dissolved

Gorbachev **presided over** dissolution; he did not will it. The memory
function: reform without control of consequences.

DOCTRINE 07 APPLICATION (CORRECTION MECHANISM ABSENCE):
The August 1991 coup attempt is the late-Soviet correction-mechanism
failure. The GKChP (State Committee on the State of Emergency) —
comprising the Vice President, Defence Minister, KGB Chairman, and
Interior Minister — attempted to correct what they perceived as
sovereign dysfunction: Gorbachev's reforms exceeding the system's
absorptive capacity. This was the most institutionally powerful
correction attempt in Russian history — the conspirators held formal
positions of authority, unlike the Guards officers of 1762 or 1801.
Yet the correction failed, and its failure *accelerated* the collapse it
was meant to prevent. The republics walked away; the centre lost all
remaining authority; Gorbachev returned but was already irrelevant.
The pattern confirms DOCTRINE 07's deepest finding: Russian correction
mechanisms fail not only because they are improvised, but because by
the time the elite acts, the institutional depth beneath the sovereign
has already been exhausted — correction and collapse arrive
simultaneously rather than sequentially. The August coup is
structurally parallel to February 1917: institutional men acting too
late, in a system already past the point where correction could
preserve the framework.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. POLYPHONIC TENSION: CONTINGENT VS STRUCTURAL
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Mercouris reading frames collapse as contingent: different leaders,
different sequencing might have preserved some form of union; Gorbachev's
choices mattered.

The realist sharpening adds: structural pressures—economic failure,
military overextension, nationalist mobilization—made some form of
crisis likely. Gorbachev's reforms **accelerated** and **channeled**
the collapse; they did not create the underlying weakness.

• Mercouris: Agency mattered; Gorbachev's errors (timing, sequencing,
  refusal to use force in Eastern Europe) shaped the outcome.
• Mearsheimer: The Soviet system could not compete; collapse was
  structurally determined; Gorbachev was the agent of an inevitable
  process.

Tension preserved without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Gorbachev encodes:

• Reform from above can unleash forces that destroy the state.
• Opening (glasnost) and restructuring (perestroika) risk legitimacy
  collapse when the system rests on myth.
• The end of the Cold War was also the end of Soviet superpower status.
• Succession and reform are existential challenges for centralized
  systems.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VIII. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Reform intended to save can destroy when legitimacy is fragile.
• Federal structure became exit mechanism when the center weakened.
• Voluntary retreat from empire is read as loss, not peace.
• Personal authority without institutional renewal is insufficient.
• Correction-mechanism absence (DOCTRINE 07): the August 1991 coup was
  the most institutionally powerful correction attempt in Russian history
  — and it failed because the institutional depth beneath the sovereign
  was already exhausted; correction and collapse arrived simultaneously.
