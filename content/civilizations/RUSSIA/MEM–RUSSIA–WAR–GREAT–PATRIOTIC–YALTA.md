I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves the Yalta Conference as **the division of
Europe**: the summit where the Big Three formalized the post-war
order, acknowledged Soviet control of Eastern Europe, and
established the architecture of the Cold War before the war
in Europe had ended.

For Russian civilizational memory, Yalta is **victory's harvest**.

At Yalta, Stalin collected the geopolitical rewards of 27 million
dead—a sphere of influence extending from the Elbe to the Pacific,
recognition as one of two superpowers, and security guarantees
against future invasion from the West.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. STRATEGIC CONTEXT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
February 1945 situation:

Eastern Front:
• Soviet forces on the Oder (60 km from Berlin)
• Poland, Hungary, most of Eastern Europe occupied
• Warsaw, Budapest fallen
• Berlin weeks away

Western Front:
• Allies recovering from Ardennes offensive
• Rhine not yet crossed
• Germany still fighting
• V-E Day three months away

Soviet forces occupied the territory being discussed.
This determined negotiating reality.

John Erickson describes the power relationship:

"At Yalta, possession was nine-tenths of diplomacy. Soviet forces
stood on the Oder; Western forces had not crossed the Rhine. The
territory under discussion—Poland, Eastern Europe, Germany itself—
was already in Soviet hands or about to be. Roosevelt and Churchill
negotiated for arrangements they could not enforce. Stalin negotiated
for arrangements he was already implementing. The conference ratified
facts on the ground."
— John Erickson, *The Road to Berlin* (1983)

Henry Kissinger frames the same reality from the standpoint of diplomacy:

"At a great-power conference, diplomacy does not create the balance
of power; it reflects it. The negotiators at Yalta were not free
to ignore the fact that Soviet armies occupied Eastern Europe."
— Henry Kissinger, *Diplomacy* (1994)

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. THE MEETING
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Yalta was the second and most consequential Big Three summit.

Participants:
• Joseph Stalin (USSR)
• Franklin D. Roosevelt (USA) — visibly ill
• Winston Churchill (UK) — weakest position

Location: Livadia Palace, Crimea (USSR)
Duration: Eight days of intensive negotiation

Stalin's advantages:
• Conference on Soviet soil
• Red Army occupying Eastern Europe
• Western forces not yet across Rhine
• Roosevelt seeking Soviet cooperation

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. GERMANY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The conference formalized Germany's fate.

Agreements:
• Unconditional surrender required
• Four occupation zones (including France)
• Berlin jointly occupied (four sectors)
• Denazification, demilitarization, democratization
• War crimes trials (later: Nuremberg)

Reparations:
• Soviet demand: $20 billion (50% to USSR)
• Accepted as "basis for discussion"
• In-kind reparations (industrial equipment)
• Labor reparations (POWs)

Germany would be divided, occupied, and stripped.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. POLAND
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Poland was Yalta's most contested issue.

Border settlement:
• Eastern border: Curzon Line (Soviet gain)
• Western border: Oder-Neisse Line (German loss)
• Poland shifted 150 km westward
• Soviet territorial gains from 1939 confirmed

Government:
• "Provisional Government of National Unity"
• Lublin (pro-Soviet) government as base
• London Poles "reorganized" into it
• "Free and unfettered elections" promised

The formula was deliberately ambiguous—Stalin interpreted
"democracy" differently than the West.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V.A POLYPHONIC TENSION: SELLOUT OR REALITY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Mercouris reading frames Poland as tragic necessity—
Stalin's security concerns were legitimate given two German
invasions; the West could not force Soviet withdrawal.

The realist sharpening adds: Poland was abandoned.

• Mercouris: Soviet security required friendly Poland; the
  West could not fight Stalin to restore 1939 borders; the
  agreements were realistic given military realities
• Mearsheimer: Roosevelt believed elections would be free;
  Churchill knew better but was overruled; Poland was traded
  for Soviet cooperation; "democracy" language was cover

The Western view (later):

"Yalta was not a sellout—there was nothing to sell. The Red
Army occupied Poland. The choice was not between free Poland
and Soviet Poland; it was between Soviet Poland with Western
complaints and Soviet Poland without them. Roosevelt and
Churchill chose the fiction of 'free elections' because the
alternative was acknowledging impotence."
— George F. Kennan, assessment reflected in *Memoirs* (1967)

Both readings contain truth:
• Soviet occupation was fact
• Western acquiescence was choice
• The election promise was never honored

Tension preserved without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. EASTERN EUROPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The pattern established for Poland applied throughout.

"Declaration on Liberated Europe":
• Free elections promised
• Democratic governments endorsed
• Self-determination affirmed

Reality:
• Soviet troops occupied the region
• Communist parties controlled governments
• "Elections" were managed
• Declaration was unenforceable

Yalta's words and Yalta's reality diverged immediately.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. UNITED NATIONS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The conference established UN structure.

Agreements:
• Security Council with five permanent members
• Veto power for permanent members
• General Assembly for all nations
• Soviet demand for 16 seats (SSR representation) reduced to 3

The UN framework gave the USSR permanent great-power status
and veto over collective action.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VIII. FAR EAST
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Stalin confirmed Soviet entry against Japan.

Terms (secret protocol):
• Soviet attack 2–3 months after V-E Day
• Territorial compensation:
  - Southern Sakhalin returned
  - Kuril Islands transferred
  - Port Arthur lease restored
  - Chinese Eastern Railway rights
• Outer Mongolia status quo (Soviet sphere)

Roosevelt agreed because:
• Atomic bomb not yet tested
• Japan invasion would cost 1 million American casualties (estimate)
• Soviet attack would fix Japanese armies in Manchuria

These terms were not shared with China until later.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IX. LEGACY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Yalta shaped the Cold War world.

What Yalta established:
• Soviet sphere in Eastern Europe
• Divided Germany
• USSR as co-equal superpower
• UN framework with Soviet veto
• Territorial settlement in Asia

What Yalta could not prevent:
• Cold War (began within two years)
• Iron Curtain (Churchill's speech: March 1946)
• Permanent division of Europe
• Soviet domination of satellites

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IX.A POLYPHONIC TENSION: BETRAYAL OR INEVITABILITY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Mercouris reading frames Yalta as the best available
outcome—given Soviet military position, the agreements
represented realistic accommodation of power realities.

The realist sharpening adds: Yalta legitimized conquest.

• Mercouris: The Red Army had earned its position through
  sacrifice; the agreements reflected military reality;
  Cold War resulted from later Soviet actions, not Yalta itself
• Mearsheimer: Yalta gave moral sanction to sphere of influence;
  the democratic language was cynical; Roosevelt's belief in
  "managing" Stalin was naive; Poland was betrayed

American critics (later):

"Yalta was not forced upon us. We chose to believe that
Stalin would honor agreements. We chose to accept his
word on elections. We chose to give legitimacy to occupation.
These were choices, not inevitabilities."
— Republican critique, post-1945

Both readings are valid:
• Soviet occupation was fact before Yalta
• Western legitimation was choice at Yalta
• The outcomes were shaped by both

Tension preserved without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
X. CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Yalta encodes:

• Military occupation determines political control
• Sacrifice creates entitlement to security
• Great-power status requires formal recognition
• Ambiguous agreements serve the stronger party
• Eastern Europe was Russia's security buffer
• The post-war world was divided at Yalta

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
XI. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Possession is stronger than principle.
• Democratic language can cover undemocratic reality.
• War exhaustion limits post-war ambition.
• Security concerns justify territorial control.
• Great-power summits formalize existing power.
• Agreements mean what the stronger party interprets.

POLYPHONIC TENSIONS (v2.0):
• MERCOURIS: Realistic accommodation → best available outcome
• MEARSHEIMER: Legitimized conquest → moral sanction for spheres
• MERCOURIS: Soviet security earned through sacrifice
• MEARSHEIMER: Polish freedom sacrificed for Soviet cooperation
• Both: Yalta formalized the division that Red Army had created

Tension preserved without verdict.
