I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves the **Great Game** as the Anglo-Russian contest
for influence and security in Central Asia: the encoding of two
empires with incompatible legitimacy claims—Britain as maritime
"midwife to modernity," Russia as land-empire guarantor of unity
and security—competing in a theatre where neither could deliver
final victory, and where the 1907 Convention formalized a
**suspended rivalry** rather than resolution.

For Russian civilizational memory, the Great Game represents
**frontier legitimacy under constraint**: expansion toward India's
approaches, prestige in the "Great Game," and the discovery that
the other empire would pay to stabilize the buffer. The Convention
did not end Russian interest in the region; it encoded a modus
vivendi that lasted until the collapse of both empires.

This MEM does not resolve:
• whether the rivalry was driven more by prestige or by security
• whether 1907 was strategic wisdom or deferred conflict
• which empire's legitimacy narrative better fitted the facts on the ground

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. LEGITIMACY ENCODING: TWO EMPIRES, TWO STORIES
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Mercouris reading frames the Great Game as a clash of
**civilizational encodings**.

Britain, in its self-understanding, acted as midwife to modernity:
rule of law, commerce, free trade, and imperial order as a
benign project. India was the jewel; Central Asia and Afghanistan
were the approaches to be denied to any rival. Russian expansion
was read as threat to the Raj and to the maritime order that
Britain claimed to uphold.

Russia encoded its own expansion as **unity and security**: the
absorption of Central Asian khanates and the push toward natural
frontiers were presented as civilizing mission, Orthodox and
imperial continuity, and the closing of vulnerable steppe and
mountain flanks. British presence in Afghanistan and Persia was
read as containment and encirclement.

Where each encoding frays—Ireland, India, Amritsar for Britain;
Poland, Baltics, Ukraine for Russia—lies outside the scope of
this MEM; the point here is that in the Great Game, **each side
saw itself as legitimate and the other as encroaching**. RLL–RUSSIA–0002
(symbolic legitimacy limits) and RLL–RUSSIA–0005 (coercion-legitimacy
inversion) apply where rhetoric of civilization met local resistance
and realpolitik.

Alexander Morrison captures the mix of motives on the Russian side:

"Russian conquest of Central Asia was driven by multiple motives:
cotton for textile mills, strategic depth against British India,
prestige in the 'Great Game,' and the simple momentum of frontier
expansion. The Silk Road cities fell one by one—their medieval
commercial glory long faded, but their strategic position still
significant."
— Alexander Morrison, *The Russian Conquest of Central Asia* (2021)

Prestige in the Great Game—the **encoding of the contest itself**
as a source of standing—is inseparable from material and strategic
motives.

II.A FERGUSON FRAME (COMPARATIVE EMPIRE · ARC–RUSSIA CATEGORY D)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Niall Ferguson (ARC–RUSSIA v3.1, Category D) frames nineteenth-century
British–Russian relations in terms of **structural asymmetry**:
maritime empire (Britain—small population, high per capita wealth,
naval and financial dominance) versus land empire (Russia—large
population, lower per capita wealth, army and territorial depth).
The Great Game is the Central Asian theatre of that asymmetry.
Ferguson's implied insights—maritime vs. land, "midwife to modernity"
vs. coercive modernizer, imperial decline and ethnic fault lines—
situate the rivalry within comparative empire and the later
"descent of the West."

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. THE CENTRAL ASIAN FRONTIER: CORRIDOR VS SACRAL
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Central Asian theatre was not a single corridor or a single
sacral centre; it was a **buffer of corridors and contested
nodes**—Afghanistan, Persia, the khanates—where British and
Russian definitions of "natural" spheres collided.

Mercouris framing: legitimacy and institutional continuity.
Russia's advance into Tashkent, Samarkand, Bukhara, Khiva, Merv
encoded the restoration of imperial reach along ancient routes;
Britain's insistence on Afghan buffer and Persian influence
encoded the defence of India and the maritime order. Each side
claimed to be stabilizing; each read the other as expansionist.

RLL–RUSSIA–0003 (corridor vs. sacral) applies where **corridors**
(approaches to India, routes to the warm water) met **sacral**
claims (the Raj as jewel, Russia's southern flank as vital).
The 1907 Convention did not resolve the underlying encodings;
it **delineated spheres** and recognized Afghanistan as buffer,
reducing the incentive for direct confrontation while leaving
legitimacy narratives intact.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. REALIST SHARPENING: INCENTIVE STRUCTURE AND BUFFER
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Mearsheimer layer adds: the Great Game was a **structural
competition** with a clear incentive structure.

Britain's incentive: protect India at acceptable cost. The Raj
was the strategic centre of gravity; Central Asia mattered as
**approaches**. Naval supremacy could not be projected inland;
buffer states and local allies were the tools. The name of the
game was to keep Russia away from the Indus and from Persian
Gulf chokepoints that could threaten the sea route to India.

Russia's incentive: secure southern flanks and gain depth.
Central Asian conquest denied the region to Britain, supplied
cotton and prestige, and pushed the frontier toward Afghanistan
and Persia. Russia could not conquer India—logistics and British
naval power made that clear—but it could **threaten** the approaches
and force Britain to pay attention. The incentive was to expand
until the marginal cost of further advance exceeded the benefit,
or until Britain offered a deal.

1907 was that deal: **spheres delineated, Afghanistan neutralized
as buffer, rivalry suspended**. Both sides had reason to agree:
Germany was rising; the balance of power was shifting. The Great
Game ended not because one side won but because the structural
incentives shifted toward cooperation against a third party.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. 1907 ANGLO-RUSSIAN CONVENTION: ENCODED SUSPENSION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Convention (August 1907) partitioned Persia into spheres of
influence, recognized Afghanistan as outside Russia's sphere (with
Britain controlling its foreign policy), and addressed Tibet. It
did not create friendship; it **formalized a modus vivendi**.

For Russian memory, 1907 encodes:
• Recognition of Russia as a power whose interests must be accommodated
• Acceptance of Russian presence in northern Persia and Central Asia
• The suspension of direct rivalry, not the abandonment of civilizational
  or strategic claims to the region

The Convention lasted until 1917. After the Revolution, the Great
Game frame was inherited by Soviet–British and later Soviet–Western
rivalry in the same theatre—different regime, similar geography.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. POLYPHONIC TENSION: PRESTIGE VS SECURITY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Mercouris reading emphasizes **legitimacy and encoding**: two
empires with different self-stories competing for standing and
influence in a theatre that became constitutive of the "Game"
itself.

The realist reading emphasizes **incentives and structure**:
buffer logic, approach-denial, and the eventual deal when
marginal costs and a rising Germany made agreement rational.

Both capture truth. The Great Game was at once a contest of
prestige and a contest of security; 1907 was at once a recognition
of Russian standing and a strategic bargain. Tension preserved
without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Great Game encodes durable Russian lessons:

• Rivalry with maritime powers in buffer zones can be stabilized
  without total victory or total defeat
• Central Asia is a theatre where legitimacy (civilizing mission,
  unity and security) and structure (depth, approaches, buffers)
  intertwine
• Conventions can suspend conflict while leaving encodings intact
• The "Game" itself became a source of prestige—to be seen as a
  player in the same contest as Britain mattered for Russian
  elite self-understanding

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VIII. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• RLL–RUSSIA–0002, 0005, 0003 apply to legitimacy and corridor/sacral
  encoding in the Great Game.
• Ferguson frame: maritime vs. land empire, comparative imperial
  trajectory; 1907 as moment of accommodation within structural
  rivalry.
• 1907 did not resolve civilizational narratives; it delineated
  spheres and recognized buffer.
• Great Game memory informs later Soviet and Russian reading of
  Central Asia and Afghanistan as contested space.
