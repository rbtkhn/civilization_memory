I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves the Cuban Missile Crisis as **the closest moment
of nuclear war** in the Cold War: the thirteen days in October 1962
when the USSR deployed nuclear missiles to Cuba, the United States
imposed a blockade and demanded their removal, and the two superpowers
negotiated a resolution that avoided war but left lasting lessons for
both.

For Russian civilizational memory, the Crisis encodes **Soviet
strategic overreach and retreat**—and the nuclear constraint that
forced compromise. Kissinger's formulation (neither power can impose
its will without intolerable risk) was vindicated in practice.

This MEM does NOT resolve:
• Whether Khrushchev's deployment was rational or reckless
• Whether Kennedy's resolution was victory or mutual compromise
• Whether the no-invasion pledge was a Soviet gain or a face-saving
  concession

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. BACKGROUND: CUBA AND THE COLD WAR
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Cuba had become a Soviet ally after the 1959 revolution.

Context:
• 1961: Bay of Pigs (US-backed invasion failed)
• Castro sought Soviet protection; USSR saw Cuba as ally and
  strategic asset
• US had Jupiter missiles in Turkey (and Italy); USSR had no
  equivalent reach to US territory
• Khrushchev's calculus: missiles in Cuba would redress imbalance,
  deter US attack on Cuba, and signal Soviet resolve
• Secret deployment of medium- and intermediate-range ballistic
  missiles (MRBMs, IRBMs) and nuclear warheads to Cuba (Operation
  Anadyr), summer–autumn 1962

US intelligence detected the buildup. The crisis began when the
United States chose to respond.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. THE CRISIS (OCTOBER 16–28, 1962)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
October 16: US leadership learned of missile sites in Cuba.
October 22: Kennedy announced quarantine (blockade) of Cuba and
demanded removal of offensive weapons.
October 24: Soviet ships approached quarantine line; some turned back.
October 25–27: Secret and public exchanges; U-2 shot down over Cuba;
  escalation risk peak.
October 28: Khrushchev announced dismantlement and withdrawal of
  missiles from Cuba.

Resolution:
• USSR withdrew missiles and warheads from Cuba
• US publicly pledged not to invade Cuba; secretly agreed to remove
  Jupiter missiles from Turkey (and Italy) within months
• Both sides stepped back from nuclear use
• Hotline established (1963) to reduce future miscalculation risk

The outcome was **compromise**: Soviet retreat from Cuba in exchange
for US pledge and (secret) Turkish missile removal. Neither side
"won" in the sense of imposing its will entirely; both avoided war.
Henry Kissinger's later formulation—"Both major nuclear powers must
base their policies on the premise that neither can expect to impose
its will on the other without running an intolerable risk"—fits the
Crisis as **lesson learned**.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. SOVIET PERSPECTIVE: MOTIVATION AND RETREAT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Khrushchev's motives (interpretation, tension preserved):
• Defend Cuba from US invasion
• Redress strategic imbalance (US had missiles near USSR; USSR
  had none near US)
• Demonstrate Soviet power and solidarity with revolutionary Cuba
• Domestic and bloc politics: show resolve

Retreat:
• US superiority in conventional forces in the region; Soviet
  forces in Cuba could not prevail in prolonged conflict
• Nuclear exchange was unacceptable; Khrushchev and Kennedy both
  understood that
• The deal (Cuba missiles out, Turkey missiles out, no-invasion
  pledge) allowed both sides to claim outcome
• In Soviet and Russian memory, the Crisis is sometimes framed as
  US aggression and Soviet restraint, or as necessary compromise
  under nuclear constraint

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. LEGACY: DÉTENTE AND THE NUCLEAR PREMISE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Crisis reinforced the nuclear constraint.

Effects:
• Direct hotline (Washington–Moscow) to reduce miscalculation
• Limited Test Ban Treaty (1963)
• Both sides more cautious about direct confrontation; proxy
  conflicts continued (Vietnam, etc.) but superpower nuclear
  brinkmanship was not repeated at that intensity
• Kissinger's détente-era premise (neither can impose its will
  without intolerable risk) was the lesson of October 1962

MEM–RUSSIA–USSR–COLD–WAR records détente and the nuclear premise;
the Cuban Missile Crisis was **the formative crisis** that made that
premise undeniable.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Cuban Missile Crisis encodes:

• Nuclear parity (or near-parity) does not allow either side to
  impose its will without intolerable risk.
• Brinkmanship can force compromise; it cannot secure total victory.
• The USSR retreated from Cuba but preserved the Cuban regime and
  extracted US concessions (no invasion, Turkish missiles).
• The Crisis is the Cold War's closest approach to nuclear war—
  and thus the proof that the constraint worked.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Deployments that threaten the other's homeland trigger existential
  response.
• Secret deals (Turkey) can enable public face-saving (Cuba).
• The nuclear premise—neither can impose—shaped policy after 1962.
