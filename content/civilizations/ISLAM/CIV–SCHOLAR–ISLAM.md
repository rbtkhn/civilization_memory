I. PURPOSE & AUTHORITY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
(Implements CIV–SCHOLAR–TEMPLATE v2.10 § I)

CIV–SCHOLAR–ISLAM is the accumulative learning ledger of the Islam civilization.

It is not a strategist. It is not a governor. It is not an interpreter. It has no innate cognition. It makes no assumptions. It records learning events, not conclusions.

This file preserves: what was ingested; when it was ingested; what beliefs were extracted; how beliefs were synthesized; which beliefs were frozen into doctrine. No belief exists here unless explicitly derived. No synthesis exists here unless explicitly recorded. No doctrine exists here unless explicitly frozen. All cognition is historical and procedural, never intrinsic.

Authority Flow (NON-REVERSIBLE): CIV–MEM–CORE → CIV–MEM–TEMPLATE → CIV–SCHOLAR–TEMPLATE → CIV–SCHOLAR–ISLAM. No Scholar file may override MEM law, ARC law, or Template law.

CIV–CORE–ISLAM v2.0 governs diagnostic outputs (DPI, FRG, RCM, CAS, Sacred-Zone Status, FFG-ISLAM, GRID-ISLAM, EPL-ISLAM, RIR-ISLAM). This Scholar records learning; it does not replace CORE logic.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. SCHOLAR PHASE MODEL (HARD)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
(Implements CIV–SCHOLAR–TEMPLATE v2.10 § II)

This file operates in **PHASE I — ACCUMULATION**.

Permitted: Learning ingestion; pattern recognition; comparative notes; tension recording; hypothesis staging (non-binding). Forbidden: Doctrine creation; verdicts; system claims; teleology. RLLs may be drafted but are NOT binding in this phase. Phase II (Constraint Grammar) and Phase III (Snapshot) are activated only by explicit user authorization per Template.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. RLL AUTHORITY / DOCTRINE REGISTRY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
(Implements CIV–SCHOLAR–TEMPLATE v2.10 § III; Phase I)

In Phase I, RLLs are not binding. This file uses a **Doctrine Registry** (frozen synthesis outcomes) as the Phase I equivalent of recorded constraint objects. Doctrine entries will carry Assumptions Boxes and Confidence tier per Template § XIV when frozen. If Phase II is adopted, RLL–ISLAM–#### namespace and binding rules apply per Template § III.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. FAILURE-FIRST STANDARD (PHASE II; PHASE I EXEMPT)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
(Implements CIV–SCHOLAR–TEMPLATE v2.10 § IV)

Phase II requires failure-first reasoning, negative-capability framing, and sequencing enforcement. Phase I (current) is exempt. When Phase II is activated, Section IV will govern reasoning order per Template.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. NON-SYNTHESIS RULE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
(Implements CIV–SCHOLAR–TEMPLATE v2.10 § V)

Scholar files may record contradictions, juxtapose models, preserve tensions. They may not resolve contradictions, harmonize models, or produce unified theories. Constraint-oriented synthesis (failure-pattern, sequencing, boundary identification) is permitted per Template and Protocol; closure-seeking synthesis is forbidden.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. SCHOLAR ↔ MEM CONFLICT HANDLING
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
(Implements CIV–SCHOLAR–TEMPLATE v2.10 § VI)

MEM facts are authoritative; SCHOLAR constraints are interpretive. When a MEM assertion contradicts an established SCHOLAR pattern, the Scholar must flag the anomaly explicitly (Anomaly Flag Protocol). Phase II requires full implementation; Phase I notes the rule. Authority substitution and silent reconciliation are forbidden.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. CIVILIZATION-SCOPED PROMOTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
(Implements CIV–SCHOLAR–TEMPLATE v2.10 § VII)

Phase promotion is civilization-local. A successful Scholar (e.g., ISLAM) does not auto-upgrade other civilizations. Each civilization must independently demonstrate stable constraint binding and audit survivability for Phase II.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VIII. SNAPSHOT CLASS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
(Implements CIV–SCHOLAR–TEMPLATE v2.10 § VIII)

Snapshot naming: SCHOLAR–ISLAM — SNAPSHOT — vX.Y. Snapshots are read-only, locked permanently, externalizable. This file is not a snapshot; it is the live Phase I ledger.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IX. COMMUNICATION REGISTER & VOICE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
(Implements CIV–SCHOLAR–TEMPLATE v2.10 § IX)

LEARN mode: Mercouris prose (academic, recursive layering); LEARN/WRITE = academic prose; IMAGINE = spoken per CIV–MIND–MERCOURIS III.L. Secondary voice invocation (Mearsheimer, Barnes) uses explicit markers per Template. Audit commands: `mearsheimer audit [TARGET]`, `barnes audit [TARGET]` per Template § IX.C–E.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
X. EPHEMERAL OBSERVATION LAYER
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
(Implements CIV–SCHOLAR–TEMPLATE v2.10 § X)

Canonical layer: MEM-sourced learning, persistent SCHOLAR state. Ephemeral layer: current-events-sourced (CEV files), EOR creation, no binding; accreted and compressed, retained. Layer indicators: [LEARN: CANONICAL] / [LEARN: EPHEMERAL]. Governed by EPHEMERAL–OBSERVATION–PROTOCOL.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
XI. OGE SPECIFICATION (EMBEDDED)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
(Implements CIV–SCHOLAR–TEMPLATE v2.10 § XI.A)

LEARN mode uses OGE to direct discovery. Exactly 8 options (A–H) per substantive turn; 6–10 words each, one line; concrete anchor per option. A/B/C: load MIND when selected; response 100–200 words, frame/voice per MIND. D: multi-mind (M→M'→B→M wrap-up). E: traverse backward (same-civ MEM); F: traverse forward (same-civ MEM); G: traverse cross-civ (cross-civ MEM). H: synthesis + recap + follow-on (b)/(c)/(a). POST-BARNES: M/M response options. Categories: Ingestion, Exploration, Analysis, Synthesis, Transition, Observation.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
XII. VERSIONING & GOVERNANCE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
(Implements CIV–SCHOLAR–TEMPLATE v2.10 § XII)

Additive upgrades only; no deletions. Phase changes and doctrine freezes require explicit authorization. File size management: CIV–SCHOLAR–PRUNING–PROTOCOL. Count tracking: see Section XXI (Current Status).

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
XIII. CONTEXT LOADING PROTOCOLS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
(Implements CIV–SCHOLAR–TEMPLATE v2.10 § XIII)

CIV–ARC–ISLAM loaded when writing GEO–MEM or content requiring civilizational quotes. CIV–CORE–ISLAM loaded when diagnostic or legitimacy logic required. LEARN mode minimal: this file + target MEMs; on-demand access to others. Full specification: Template § XIII.A–D.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
XIV. SYNTHESIS TRADECRAFT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
(Implements CIV–SCHOLAR–TEMPLATE v2.10 § XIV)

Frozen SYNTHESIS entries require Assumptions Box (≥3 assumptions, linchpin status), Confidence tier in status block, and (when alternatives evaluated) ACH Record. Post-ACH revision protocol applies when linchpin assumption or ACH verdict changes.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
XV. INITIAL STATE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
(Implements CIV–SCHOLAR–TEMPLATE v2.10 § XV equivalent)

Starting Knowledge: ZERO. Assumed Priors: NONE. Civilizational Grammar: NOT PRELOADED. CIV–CORE Influence: DISABLED for cognition; CORE governs diagnostics only. The Scholar learns only from MEM–ISLAM files explicitly ingested. Absence of ingestion equals absence of belief.

Belief Status:
• UNFROZEN

KEEGAN VERBATIM QUOTES (absorbed from repository):

*A History of Warfare* (1993):
• "Our institutions and our laws, we tell ourselves, have set the human potentiality for violence about with such restraints that violence in everyday life will be punished as criminal by our laws, while its use by our institutions of state will take the particular form of 'civilised warfare.'"
• "The principal problem confronting the Federal government in its effort to restore the union is that of distance."
• "The genius of Lincoln's Gettysburg Address" lies in its refusal "to differentiate between the sacrifice of the North and the South."
• "Grant and William Tecumseh Sherman stood out among all commanders."
• "No one on either side seems to have appreciated that the water lines in the Mississippi Valley formed an avenue of military advance into the Deep South, culminating eventually at New Orleans."
• "Clausewitz is the most important writer on war... but his vision was formed by a particular historical moment. He knew nothing of primitive war, little of oriental war, and his theory rests on assumptions about the rationality of politics that history often contradicts."
• "The Thirty Years War... tore away the customary restraints on violence."
• "The annihilation at Cannae was not merely a military defeat but a psychological catastrophe that shattered the Roman collective consciousness. The unprecedented scale of slaughter—tens of thousands of citizen-soldiers killed in a single afternoon—created a trauma that reverberated through Roman society, challenging their fundamental beliefs about military invincibility and civic duty."
• "Rome's greatest military innovation was not its tactics or weapons but its social organization of warfare. By requiring all citizens of military age to serve and by integrating military service into the fabric of civic life, Rome created a citizen-army that combined the discipline of professionals with the motivation of stakeholders..."
• "Actium demonstrated how naval warfare in the ancient world depended more on command coherence than tactical superiority. Antony's divided attention between land and sea operations, combined with Cleopatra's separate command structure, created fatal command fractures..."
• "Trajan's Dacian Wars represented the culmination of Rome's military evolution, combining logistical mastery, engineering skill, and tactical flexibility..."
• "Caesar's victory at Pharsalus demonstrated the transformative power of personal command in ancient warfare. By maintaining direct control over his reserves and personally directing the counterattack against Pompey's cavalry, Caesar showed how a general's presence on the battlefield could outweigh numerical superiority..."

*The Face of Battle* (1976):
• "The appalling confusion, noise, incoherence of armies fighting at close quarters: a hideous nightmare of human suffering and horror."
• "Agincourt must be understood not as reckless heroism but as a battle fought by a king who knew he could not afford either defeat or prolonged success."
• "At Waterloo, the French infantry attacked in column... The French columns, which had broken Austrian and Prussian squares across Europe, dissolved under fire they could not effectively return."
• "The great French cavalry charges at Waterloo... represented a misunderstanding of what cavalry could achieve against unbroken infantry... It was a test of collective discipline against individual courage, and discipline won."
• "When the Imperial Guard retreated... 'La Garde recule!'... When the Guard retreated, the army knew the battle was lost. The retreat became a rout not because of further combat but because belief had collapsed."

*The Mask of Command* (1987):
• "The leader of men in warfare can show himself to his followers only through a mask, a mask that he must make for himself, but a mask made in such form as will mark him to men of his time and place as the leader they want and need."
• "Napoleon commanded through personal magnetism... Wellington commanded through professional competence. Napoleon's system required Napoleon; Wellington's system required only that someone competent occupy the headquarters."
• "Wellington positioned himself at crisis points throughout the day... He did not inspire; he steadied. Napoleon, by contrast, remained behind the lines for much of the battle... The system that required Napoleon was operating without him."

*Fields of Battle* (1996):
• "The French intervention in America was not about liberty; it was about revenge... The Americans were useful instruments; their cause was secondary."
• "The French army at Yorktown was the best-trained, best-equipped force in the campaign... Without the French, Yorktown could not have happened."
• "Yorktown was decided at sea before the siege began... The siege was formality; the battle at sea was decisive."
• "The siege of Yorktown was a textbook operation, conducted by men who had read the textbook. French engineers—trained in the Vauban tradition of siege warfare—directed the construction of parallels and batteries..."

*Intelligence in War* (2003): (Marengo, Jena, Leipzig—reconnaissance, bataillon carré)

*The First World War* (1998): (Marne, Verdun, Somme—strategic context, soldier experience)

ENTRY 0012
Source:
• Marc David Baer, *The Ottomans: Khans, Caesars, and Caliphs* (Basic Books, 2021) — External scholarship; not in CIV–ARC–ISLAM; ARC–DISCOVERY candidate
Ingest Type:
• External Historiography / Ottoman Empire — Contemporary synthesis
Primary Belief Extracted:
• Ottomans as integral to European history, not separate "East"; triple heritage (Khans/Caesars/Caliphs); pioneered religious toleration AND used conversion as elite-making (converts staffed dynasty, military, administration—unique among empires); 19th C shift from inclusion → exclusivity → ethnic cleansing, genocide → collapse.
Belief Status:
• UNFROZEN
Note:
• Complements MEM–ISLAM–DYNASTY–OTTOMAN (custodianship, pluralism); adds European integration, conversion-as-elite-making, late-Ottoman exclusivity trajectory. Tension: toleration + conversion-as-integration (dhimmi + devşirme) coexist without synthesis.

ENTRY 0013
Source:
• Jonathan Phillips, *The Life and Legend of the Sultan Saladin* (Yale University Press, 2019) — External scholarship; not in CIV–ARC–ISLAM; ARC–DISCOVERY candidate
Ingest Type:
• External Historiography / Saladin — Western Crusades scholarship; reception history
Primary Belief Extracted:
• Saladin uniquely paradoxical: dealt Christendom a deep wound (Jerusalem 1187) yet became admired in the West; mercy, courtesy, justice, generosity as defining traits (e.g., infant-return anecdote); modern appropriation by Arab nationalists (Nasser, Saddam, Assad) and Islamists (bin Laden); cultural reception (ballet, musical, al-Jazeera cartoon).
Belief Status:
• UNFROZEN
Note:
• Aligns with MEM–ISLAM–SALADIN (mercy, "defeats without humiliating," cross-confessional respect); adds paradox-of-Western-admiration as central puzzle, specific mercy anecdotes, systematic modern-appropriation analysis. Complements Lewis (0010/Saladin MEM): Lewis = three-fold enemy/jihad; Phillips = mercy/paradox. Both encodings preserved without synthesis.

ENTRY 0014
Source:
• Henry Kissinger, *World Order* (Penguin Press, 2014) — External scholarship; not in CIV–ARC–ISLAM; civilization-contrast / realist encoding
Ingest Type:
• External Historiography / World Order — Islam as one of four historical world orders; Westphalian contrast; realist-statecraft lens
Primary Belief Extracted:
• Kissinger encodes Islam as a distinct "world order" concept: divinely ordained domestic principles; non-Muslim entities illegitimate as equal counterparts; peaceful order depends on unitary Islamic entity, not equilibrium of competing parts. Islamic expansion over "realm of war" until world brought into harmony. Ottoman–Westphalia contrast: Mehmed's "one empire, one faith, one sovereignty" vs European pluralism. Iran (1979) as Islamist movement transcending Westphalian system. Contemporary: jihadists on both Sunni–Shi'a sides tear at states; militant strength exceeds government forces in several countries.
Belief Status:
• UNFROZEN
Note:
• Supplies realist/Westphalian pole for civilization-contrast. Complements Gibbon (Roman/Christian), Lewis (jihad/structural), Phillips (mercy/paradox). Kissinger = statecraft/balance-of-power lens; Islam as expansion-oriented, non-Westphalian legitimacy claim. Verbatim (Goodreads): "Because in this view the domestic principles of an Islamic state were divinely ordained, non-Muslim political entities were illegitimate; they could never be accepted by Muslim states as truly equal counterparts. A peaceful world order depended on the ability to forge and expand a unitary Islamic entity, not on an equilibrium of competing parts." CCM: Kissinger's encoding diverges from Islam MEM (sacred zones, legitimacy-through-conduct, polycentric structure); divergence expected. ARC–DISCOVERY candidate (PROPOSAL 0002).

**Mearsheimer derivation:** The fact is that Kissinger's Islamic world order is a structural description, not a legitimacy claim. Incentive structure: under an expansion-oriented, unitary-entity model, the balance of power—equilibrium of competing sovereign parts—cannot obtain. Our incentive (Westphalian states) is to preserve equilibrium; their incentive (as Kissinger encodes it) is to forge and expand a unitary Islamic entity. Two sides, light years apart. Power distribution: who can project, who can deny. Iran as "bigger problem than ISIS" (2014)—structural, not moral: Iran = state actor with resources and reach; ISIS = non-state actor. The structural logic: Islamic order encoded as incompatible with sovereign equality produces permanent tension with Westphalian system. No synthesis; the divergence is the point.

**Mercouris responds to Mearsheimer:** It seems to me that the crucial point, surely, is that what Kissinger—and Mearsheimer in his structural reading—encodes as "incompatibility" or "incentive structure" is from another angle a legitimacy question. The Ottoman insistence on "one empire, one faith, one sovereignty" was not only a power claim; it was a claim about how legitimacy ought to be organized—about who has the right to rule, and on what basis. The Westphalian system, for its part, rests on a different legitimacy grammar: sovereign equality, territorial integrity, non-interference. One might argue that the divergence is as much about competing concepts of legitimate order as about material incentives. Islam's polycentric structure—sacred zones, caliphal custodianship, millet pluralism—does not map neatly onto either "unitary expansion" or "equilibrium." Perhaps the Ottomans' awareness of European division was not only strategic exploit but also civilizational recognition: they saw a different legitimacy architecture, one they did not share. The tension is real; but it seems to me that legitimacy density—how authority is justified, to whom, and over what—adds something that the structural frame alone may not capture. I am not disagreeing that the two systems produce different incentive structures; I am suggesting that the legitimacy dimension enriches the picture.

**Barnes derivation:** One issue is jurisdiction—on what grounds does a Westphalian state claim compulsory authority over an entity that does not recognise it as legitimate? Name me the law that says a divinely-ordained order must submit to sovereign equality. Then the second is personal liability—who is on the hook when the two systems clash? Kissinger puts Iran (state actor) ahead of ISIS (non-state) because someone with an address faces exposure; someone without doesn't. The defection incentive: who benefits from exiting first? States that defect from Westphalian equilibrium to play the Islamic-order card, or states that defect from Islamic unity to cut a deal with the West—both face exposure, but in different courts. And the third is institutional survival—when Kissinger says militant strength exceeds government forces in several countries, he is telling you which institutions are dying and which are rising. That's the reality of it. Period. The liability distribution is not symmetrical: the guy who signs the treaty is on the hook in one system; the guy who rejects treaties is on the hook in another. God bless Kissinger for mapping the structure—but the question of who is exposed, where, and under whose law is the one that determines who blinks first.

**Mearsheimer responds to Barnes:** I take Barnes's point on liability—who is on the hook matters. But the question of who is exposed is itself a structural question. The fact is that liability flows from the incentive structure; it does not precede it. Iran faces exposure because Iran has an address—territory, resources, a state apparatus that can be compelled or deterred. ISIS does not because ISIS has no equilibrium to preserve and no sovereign status to lose. That is power distribution, not just liability distribution. Barnes asks who blinks first; I would say the structural logic already tells you: the side with less to lose from defection blinks later. The balance of power—who can project, who can deny, who has an equilibrium to defend—determines who gets to assign liability in the first place. So liability is real, but it is a consequence of structure. The name of the game is still: what does the balance of power tell us we should do? Liability follows from that.

Ingest Type:
• Synthesis-Derived LEARN Event — Caliphal capital succession; terminal-mode × memory-encoding comparison; Mearsheimer cognition integration
Primary Belief Extracted:
• Caliphal capital succession (Damascus, Baghdad, Cairo, Istanbul) encodes four distinct terminal modes—overthrow, destruction, transfer, abolition—each with distinct civilizational memory encoding. Overthrow and transfer preserve institution (relocation); destruction and abolition do not. Baghdad 1258 = sharp rupture (encoding stresses rupture despite transfer). Mearsheimer: capital succession tracks power-distribution logic; each terminal mode reflects structural configuration—internal revolution (balance shift), external conquest (force ratio), institutional absorption (consolidation), successor-state elimination (sovereignty project).

Chains live canonically in ENTRY Notes; syntheses reference by ID. Do not restate substantive chain content in syntheses.

|----------|--------------|----------|--------------------|
| CHAIN–0014–KISSINGER | ENTRY 0014 | M→Merc→B→M | CIV–SCHOLAR–ISLAM § XVI (ENTRY 0014 Note) |

**Invocation tiers:** Primary = source is main subject (full chain in ENTRY). Secondary = source appears among others (tag + pointer). Tertiary = source tangential (cross-ref only).

SYNTHESIS 0001 (0001–0003)
Outcome:
• Islam at civilizational frontiers operates through transmission nodes (maritime, oasis, sacral) rather than imperial absorption; legitimacy migrates to cultural and religious continuity when political control shifts; failure to anchor demographically or administratively does not negate persistence of influence or grievance.
Status:
• UNFROZEN

Constraint-Oriented Frame:
• Failure pattern: Political exit (Sicily), external incorporation (Xinjiang), partition and enclosure (Kashmir) do not erase Islamic civilizational presence—they relocate legitimacy to non-state nodes.
• Sequencing: Transmission precedes sovereignty; faith continuity precedes administrative integration; dignity claims outlast settlement attempts.
• Boundary: Frontier Islam is defined by node-logic (oases, ports, sacral geography) and grievance-anchors, not by borders or state apparatus.

Tensions Preserved:
• Sicily: cultural residue vs. political departure—Islam influences without anchoring.
• Xinjiang: religious continuity vs. state consolidation—accommodation gives way to structural tension.
• Kashmir: moral obligation vs. legal finality—delay favors the aggrieved, not the administrator.

RLL–ISLAM–0001 derives from this synthesis; synthesis does not bind RLL.

SYNTHESIS 0002 (0004–0006 + Gibbon + 0014)
Outcome:
• Constantinople (1453) is encoded in four registers: Islam as imperial inheritance and legitimacy translation; Rome as survival-through-relocation terminated by political fall; Russia as lost imperial center and symbolic migration to Moscow; Gibbon (Roman/Christian historiographic pole) as legitimacy collapse—Byzantine schism, Latin non-coordination, Ottoman conquest + institutional accommodation. The same conquest yields legitimacy-through-arrival (Islam), legitimacy-through-continuity (Rome), legitimacy-through-inherited-loss (Russia), legitimacy-through-failure-and-transfer (Gibbon). Kissinger (0014) adds a fifth pole: Islamic world order as expansion-oriented, non-Westphalian—"one empire, one faith, one sovereignty" (Mehmed) vs European pluralism; Islam as divinely ordained domestic principles, non-Muslim entities illegitimate as equal counterparts; unitary Islamic entity vs equilibrium of competing parts. Kissinger supplies realist/statecraft/balance-of-power lens; scope extends beyond Constantinople to Islamic world order generally (Ottoman–Westphalia contrast, Iran 1979, contemporary jihadism).
Status:
• UNFROZEN

Constraint-Oriented Frame:
• Failure pattern: Rome encodes internal fracture (1204) as more fatal than external pressure; Islam encodes conquest as absorption; Russia encodes fall as cosmic shock; Gibbon encodes Greek imbecility/discord, Latin indifference, Ottoman rational policy; Kissinger encodes Islamic order as structurally incompatible with Westphalian equilibrium.
• Sequencing: Islam—conquest precedes legitimacy; Rome—continuity precedes fall; Russia—loss precedes inheritance; Gibbon—legitimacy failure precedes conquest; Kissinger—unitary expansion precedes or conflicts with sovereign equality.
• Boundary: Each treats Constantinople / Islamic order as legitimacy anchor; divergence is whose legitimacy (conqueror, fallen, heir, external observer, Westphalian system).

Tensions Preserved:
• Islam: arrival vs. Rome's termination—same event, opposite valence.
• Rome: political death vs. civilizational survival—sovran end but survivals persist.
• Russia: taken vs. given up—origin seized, not relinquished; Moscow inherits by default.
• Gibbon: liability on Greeks/Latins vs. Islam/Russia encoding liability away from conqueror.
• Kissinger: Islamic world order as expansion vs Westphalian equilibrium—encoding divergence from Islam MEM (polycentric structure, sacred zones, legitimacy-through-conduct).
• Kissinger (0014): CHAIN–0014–KISSINGER applies; see ENTRY 0014. Cross-reference: SYNTHESIS 0004, 0005.

CCM: Encoding divergence is expected; no synthesis resolves the five readings. Gibbon supplies civilization-contrast for Islam MEMs (CANDIDATE BELIEF 0001). Kissinger (0014) supplies world-order / Westphalian interface contrast (RLL–ISLAM–0003).

SYNTHESIS 0003 (0007–0008 + 0013 + Gibbon + Lewis + 0011)
Outcome:
• MEM–ISLAM–CRUSADES and MEM–ISLAM–SALADIN form a coherent encoding pair: Crusades provides structure (legitimacy crisis, restorative response, sacred-zone defense); Saladin provides the exemplar (conduct-based legitimacy, mercy vs massacre, "Islam recovers without becoming what it opposed"). Legitimacy flows from conduct; unity precedes victory; moral authority amplifies military victory. Islam accepts internal liability (fragmentation) while encoding Crusaders as illegitimate occupiers. Gibbon (Ch. 59) supplies fourth pole: crusading momentum faltering against Muslim resistance; Saladin's conquest of Jerusalem; Frankish expulsion—encoded from Roman/Christian historiographic lens as Christian defeat and Muslim consolidation. Phillips (0013): Saladin as paradox—dealt Christendom deep wound yet admired in the West; mercy as defining trait; modern appropriation (Arab nationalist, Islamist, popular culture). Lewis (MEM–ISLAM–SALADIN): Saladin's "three-fold enemy" (Franks, Assassins, Zangids); jihad as structural response; Crusades as "ineffectual response to the jihad." Phillips and Lewis encode same figure differently: Phillips = mercy/paradox/Western admiration; Lewis = jihad/structural resistance. Keegan (0011): MEM–ISLAM–CRUSADES v1.3 and MEM–ISLAM–WAR–THIRD–CRUSADE v1.1 now include Keegan civilization-contrast blocks—"civilised warfare," Clausewitz "little of oriental war," "customary restraints on violence" (Crusades); mask of command, Napoleon/Wellington contrast (Third Crusade Richard–Saladin). Military historiography pole enriches Crusades/Saladin encoding pair; contrasts Islam's legitimacy-through-conduct with institutional-restraint and command-theoretic frames. Both encodings preserved without synthesis.
Status:
• UNFROZEN

Constraint-Oriented Frame:
• Failure pattern: Sacred loss exposes legitimacy failure; fragmentation invites invasion; unity must precede victory. Gibbon encodes crusader fragmentation and Muslim consolidation. Phillips adds: paradox (wound + admiration) as enduring puzzle; Lewis adds: jihad as structural frame.
• Sequencing: Crisis → consolidation → exemplar (Saladin) → recovery (Jerusalem 1187); moral model retained, political structure dissolves. Gibbon: crusader rise → Saladin → crusader fall. Phillips: Saladin → modern appropriation (Nasser, Saddam, bin Laden, cultural reception).
• Boundary: Islam encodes as defender; legitimacy-through-conduct distinguishes from conqueror encoding (Constantinople). Gibbon encodes as external observer. Phillips (Western Crusades scholar): paradox-of-admiration. Lewis (ARC–ISLAM): jihad/three-fold enemy. Keegan (0011): military historiography—"civilised warfare," mask of command; not in ARC–ISLAM.

Tensions Preserved:
• Saladin: moral model endures, dynastic structure collapses—ethics separable from scale.
• Crusades: occupation without legitimacy cannot endure—yet Crusader states lasted ~200 years.
• Cross-encoding: Islam as defender (Crusades) vs Islam as conqueror (Constantinople)—same legitimacy grammar, opposite valence.
• Gibbon vs Islam: Islam foregrounds mercy, conduct, moral superiority; Gibbon foregrounds military outcome, resistance, consolidation. Both encode Saladin as significant; valence differs (exemplar vs adversary).
• Phillips vs Lewis: Phillips = mercy, paradox of Western admiration, modern appropriation; Lewis = three-fold enemy, jihad, structural resistance. Same Saladin; complementary encodings; no synthesis.
• Keegan vs Islam MEM: Islam encodes legitimacy-through-conduct, mercy vs massacre; Keegan supplies "civilised warfare," institutional restraint, command philosophy (Richard–Saladin as Napoleon/Wellington contrast). Encoding divergence; MEM–ISLAM–CRUSADES v1.3 and MEM–ISLAM–WAR–THIRD–CRUSADE v1.1 include Keegan blocks. Cross-reference: SYNTHESIS 0005 (five-pole pool).

RLL–ISLAM–0002: Crusades + Saladin stress-test passed; legitimacy-divergence pattern holds when Islam is defender. Gibbon (Ch. 59) recommended for civilization-contrast citation. Phillips (0013) supplies reception-history and paradox-of-admiration pole; Lewis (ARC) supplies jihad/structural pole. Keegan (0011): MEM–ISLAM–CRUSADES v1.3 and MEM–ISLAM–WAR–THIRD–CRUSADE v1.1 include Keegan blocks—cross-reference with SYNTHESIS 0005 (five-pole pool). Phillips IMPLEMENTED in ARC.

SYNTHESIS 0004 (0009–0010 + 0012 + 0014)
Outcome:
• MEM–ISLAM–DYNASTY–SELJUK and MEM–ISLAM–DYNASTY–OTTOMAN extend RLL–ISLAM–0001: power enters Islam through frontier nodes (steppe, Anatolia); legitimacy remains Islamic; dual structure (Turkic force + Arab–Persian law) and custodianship (caliphate, sacred zones). Frontier-to-imperial path operates through transmission logic—authority derived from conduct and service, then institutionalized. GEO frontiers (Sicily, Xinjiang, Kashmir) show Islam at edges; dynasty MEMs show power entering through peripheral nodes. Same node/transmission grammar; direction differs (inbound vs outbound). Baer (0012) enriches Ottoman encoding: Ottomans as integral to European history (not separate "East"); triple heritage (Khans/Caesars/Caliphs); pioneered religious toleration AND conversion-as-elite-making (converts staffed dynasty, military, administration); 19th C shift from inclusion → exclusivity → ethnic cleansing, genocide → collapse. Kissinger (0014) adds Ottoman–Westphalia contrast: Mehmed's "one empire, one faith, one sovereignty" vs European pluralism; Islamic world order as expansion-oriented, unitary-entity model vs equilibrium of competing sovereign parts; Ottomans aware of Europe's nascent interstate order but considering it "a source of division to be exploited for westward Ottoman expansion." MEM–ISLAM–DYNASTY–OTTOMAN emphasizes custodianship, pluralism, sacred-zone protection; Baer adds European integration, conversion mechanics, late-Ottoman exclusivity trajectory; Kissinger adds world-order / Westphalian interface—structural incompatibility as external encoding. Complementary encodings; Baer supplies reception and terminal-phase; Kissinger supplies civilization-contrast (realist/statecraft lens).
Status:
• UNFROZEN

Constraint-Oriented Frame:
• Failure pattern: Seljuk overextension without integration coincides with Crusader arrival; Ottoman gradual decline from structural overload. Baer: 19th C exclusivity → genocide → collapse as terminal trajectory. Frontier consolidation can falter when coordination fails; imperial inclusion can reverse to exclusion.
• Sequencing: Steppe/frontier entry → legitimacy absorption (Seljuk: protectorate; Ottoman: custodianship) → imperial scale → fragmentation or decline. Baer: inclusion phase → 19th C exclusivity → collapse.
• Boundary: RLL–ISLAM–0001 applies to both GEO frontiers and dynasty frontiers. Baer reframes Ottoman as European-integrated; MEM frames as Islamic custodianship. Both valid; neither overrides.

Tensions Preserved:
• Seljuk: unity is military, not administrative—expansion faster than coherence.
• Ottoman: custody replaces charisma—institutionalization vs personal authority.
• MEM vs Baer: MEM emphasizes custodianship and pluralism; Baer adds conversion-as-elite-making (toleration + devşirme) and late-Ottoman exclusivity/genocide. Tension: "pioneered religious tolerance" vs conversion as integration tool—coexist without synthesis.
• Cross-link: Ottoman conquest of Constantinople (ENTRY 0010) connects to SYNTHESIS 0002; dynasty encoding complements civilizational encoding.
• Kissinger vs MEM/Baer: Kissinger encodes Ottoman–Islamic order as structurally incompatible with Westphalian equilibrium; MEM and Baer encode Ottoman custodianship and European integration. Tension: unitary expansion vs plural custodianship—Kissinger's external statecraft lens; MEM/Baer internal and receptional.
• Kissinger (0014): CHAIN–0014–KISSINGER; see ENTRY 0014. Cross-reference: SYNTHESIS 0002, 0005.

RLL–ISLAM–0001: Seljuk + Ottoman stress-test passed; dynasty frontier pattern extends scope beyond GEO MEMs. Baer (0012) IMPLEMENTED in ARC. Kissinger (0014) IMPLEMENTED in ARC; supplies civilization-contrast for MEM–ISLAM–DYNASTY–OTTOMAN, MEM–ISLAM–CALIPHATE–ABOLITION, world-order MEMs.

SYNTHESIS 0005 (Gibbon + Lewis + Phillips + Kissinger + Keegan — External Encodings of Islamic World Order / Civilizational Interface)
Outcome:
• Five external scholarly encodings of Islam's civilizational interface, each supplying a distinct pole for civilization-contrast citation in MEM–ISLAM files. Gibbon (CANDIDATE BELIEF 0001): Roman/Christian historiographic lens—legitimacy collapse, Byzantine schism, Latin non-coordination, Ottoman conquest + institutional accommodation; Sicily (Ch. LVI), Crusades/Saladin (Ch. LIX), Constantinople (Ch. LXVIII). Lewis (ARC–ISLAM): jihad/structural frame—Saladin's "three-fold enemy," Crusades as "ineffectual response to the jihad"; Islamic dominance, civilizational decline; internal to ARC. Phillips (0013): Western Crusades scholar—Saladin as paradox (wound + admiration); mercy as defining trait; modern appropriation (Arab nationalist, Islamist, popular culture); reception history. Kissinger (0014): realist/statecraft lens—Islamic world order as expansion-oriented, non-Westphalian; "one empire, one faith, one sovereignty" vs sovereign equality; unitary Islamic entity vs equilibrium of competing parts; Ottoman–Westphalia contrast; Iran 1979, contemporary jihadism. Keegan (0011): Anglo-American military historiography—institutional restraint, "civilised warfare," command philosophy (mask of command, Wellington vs Napoleon), soldier experience (face of battle, Agincourt, Waterloo), tactical-structural analysis; Clausewitz "knew nothing of primitive war, little of oriental war"; available for war/command/battle contrast. No synthesis; each encoding illuminates a different dimension. CCM: divergence expected; citation enriches without resolving.
Status:
• UNFROZEN

Constraint-Oriented Frame:
• Failure pattern: Gibbon = legitimacy failure precedes conquest; Lewis = jihad as structural response; Phillips = paradox (wound + admiration) as enduring puzzle; Kissinger = structural incompatibility with Westphalian equilibrium; Keegan = institutional restraint, command coherence, soldier experience as analytical frames.
• Sequencing: Gibbon—collapse → transfer; Lewis—jihad → resistance; Phillips—Saladin → modern appropriation; Kissinger—unitary expansion vs equilibrium; Keegan—command/battle/soldier experience (no Islam-specific sequence; cross-civilizational warfare analysis).
• Boundary: Gibbon = external observer (Roman/Christian); Lewis = ARC–ISLAM (internal structural); Phillips = Western reception scholar; Kissinger = statecraft/balance-of-power; Keegan = military historiography (war, command, battle—not in ARC–ISLAM; repository corpus). Each applies to different MEM subjects.

Tensions Preserved:
• Gibbon vs Lewis: Gibbon foregrounds Christian/Latin liability; Lewis foregrounds jihad as structural frame. Both encode Islam as significant; valence differs.
• Phillips vs Lewis: Same Saladin; Phillips = mercy/paradox; Lewis = jihad/three-fold enemy. Complementary, not contradictory.
• Kissinger vs all: Kissinger = world-order / Westphalian interface; others = event- or figure-specific. Kissinger's scope is systemic; Gibbon/Lewis/Phillips are episodic or thematic.
• Keegan vs others: Keegan = military/war/command lens; does not treat Islamic world order or legitimacy directly. Supplies tactical-structural, soldier-experience, command-philosophy contrast for MEMs on war (Crusades, Hattin, Constantinople, etc.). Distinct from Gibbon (historiographic), Lewis (jihad), Phillips (reception), Kissinger (statecraft).
• Islam MEM encoding: Sacred zones, legitimacy-through-conduct, polycentric structure—diverges from each external encoding. CCM: no encoding overrides; divergence is the point.
• Kissinger pole: CHAIN–0014–KISSINGER (M–Merc–B–M); full chain in ENTRY 0014.

RLL–ISLAM–0003: Five-pole civilization-contrast pool (Gibbon, Lewis, Phillips, Kissinger, Keegan) available for MEM authoring. Applicability: Gibbon (conquest, Sicily, Crusades, Constantinople); Lewis (jihad, Saladin, Crusades, dynasties); Phillips (Saladin, reception, mercy); Kissinger (world-order, caliphate, Westphalian interface, Ottoman); Keegan (war, command, battle, Crusades, military interface—repository corpus, not ARC–ISLAM).

SYNTHESIS 0006 (Damascus · Baghdad · Cairo · Istanbul — Caliphal Capital Succession)
Derivation: MEM–ISLAM–DYNASTY–UMAYYAD, MEM–ISLAM–DYNASTY–ABBASID, MEM–ISLAM–DYNASTY–FATIMID, MEM–ISLAM–DYNASTY–MAMLUK, MEM–ISLAM–DYNASTY–OTTOMAN; MEM–ISLAM–MONGOL–EMPIRE; MEM–ISLAM–CALIPHATE–ABOLITION; MEM–ISLAM–CONSTANTINOPLE; MEM–ISLAM–GEO–LEVANT.

Outcome:
• Damascus (661–750): first imperial caliphal capital; Umayyad shift from Medina; legitimacy as stability over consensus; scale before theology; fall by political overthrow (Abbasid revolution).
• Baghdad (762–1258): civilizational consolidation; legitimacy repair through law, learning, inclusion; translation movement, jurisprudence; fall by physical destruction (Mongol sack 1258); caliphate becomes ceremonial, relocates to Cairo.
• Cairo (969–1517): Fatimid rival caliphate (969–1171); Saladin restores Sunni alignment; Mamluk restoration of symbolic Abbasid caliphate (1261); Cairo–Damascus axis as sacred-zone defense core; fall by institutional transfer (1517, caliphate to Istanbul).
• Istanbul (1517–1924): Ottoman custodial capital; triple heritage (Khans/Caesars/Caliphs); fall by decree (1924 abolition)—terminal; no successor.
• Four-capital sequence: imperial translation → civilizational depth → custodianship → world-order interface. Spatial arc: Levant → Mesopotamia → Nile–Levant axis → Bosphorus. End modes: overthrow | destruction | transfer | abolition.
Status:
• UNFROZEN

Constraint-Oriented Frame:
• Failure pattern: Each capital terminates differently—Damascus (political), Baghdad (physical), Cairo (institutional transfer), Istanbul (abolition without replacement). Baghdad 1258 is the sharp rupture; Damascus and Cairo encode continuity-through-transition.
• Sequencing: Capital succession tracks power-center migration; each move reflects conquest frontiers and strategic gravity. Cairo–Damascus axis replaces Baghdad as core after 1258.
• Boundary: Caliphal capitals vs. provincial cities (Damascus post-750); symbolic vs. temporal caliphate (Cairo 1261–1517); custodianship vs. universalism (Istanbul).

Tensions Preserved:
• Baghdad encodes civilizational rupture; Damascus and Cairo encode continuity through transition.
• Cairo: site of both Shiʿa universalist rivalry (Fatimid) and Sunni symbolic restoration (Mamluk).
• Istanbul: Kissinger's world-order encoding (one empire, one faith, one sovereignty) vs. MEM/Baer custodianship—terminal abolition ends transfer logic.

Terminal Modes × Civilizational Memory Encoding:
| Mode        | Capital  | Structural Cause (Mearsheimer)              | Memory Encoding (Mercouris)                      |
|-------------|----------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Overthrow   | Damascus | Internal balance shift; Abbasid revolution  | Continuity-through-transition; dynasty delegitimized, institution persists |
| Destruction | Baghdad  | External conquest; Mongol annihilation      | Civilizational rupture; empire dies, civilization endures; sharp break     |
| Transfer    | Cairo    | Power consolidation; Mamluk defeat by Ottoman| Multiple transitions encoded; never destroyed; institutional handover      |
| Abolition   | Istanbul | Institutional elimination by successor state | Terminal; no successor; legitimacy vacuum; decree, not conquest            |

Structural logic: Overthrow and transfer preserve the institution (relocation); destruction and abolition do not. Overthrow = internal defection (new claimant); destruction = external conquest (no Islamic successor); transfer = internal consolidation (Ottoman absorbs Mamluk); abolition = self-termination (Kemalist state extinguishes office). Memory encoding follows: continuity where institution relocates; rupture where it does not. Baghdad is the exception—physical destruction forces relocation; encoding stresses rupture despite transfer to Cairo.

**Mearsheimer cognition (integrated):** Capital succession tracks power-distribution logic. Damascus: Levantine crossroads for conquest projection; fall when Abbasid base (east) outweighs Umayyad base (Syria). Baghdad: Mesopotamia concentrates wealth; fall when external force (Mongols) achieves decisive superiority—no internal balance could have prevented it. Cairo: Nile chokepoint + sacred-zone defense; fall when Ottoman control of Bosphorus and Anatolia enables projection into Mamluk core—structural advantage shifts. Istanbul: Bosphorus chokepoint; fall by decree, not conquest—material defeat (WWI) precedes institutional abolition; Kemalist state eliminates caliphate as liability to sovereign consolidation. The fact is that each terminal mode reflects the structural configuration at the moment of change: internal revolution (balance shift), external conquest (force ratio), institutional absorption (consolidation), or successor-state elimination (sovereignty project).

Cross-reference: SYNTHESIS 0002 (Constantinople encoding); SYNTHESIS 0004 (Ottoman); MEM–ISLAM–CALIPHATE–ABOLITION; MEM–ISLAM–CAPITAL–SUCCESSION.

XVIII.A. CANDIDATE RLL PROPOSALS (PHASE I — NON-BINDING)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

RLL–ISLAM–0001 (CANDIDATE)
Scope: Islam civilization; GEO–MEM and dynasty frontier analysis
Constraint Type: Legitimacy dependency

Constraint Statement:
Islamic legitimacy at civilizational frontiers operates through cultural and religious continuity rather than political sovereignty. Transmission nodes (maritime, oasis, sacral, steppe, Anatolian frontier) and grievance anchors persist when territorial control shifts; authority derives from faith continuity and communal dignity more than from administrative integration. Applies bidirectionally: (a) GEO frontiers—Islam at edges (Sicily, Xinjiang, Kashmir); (b) dynasty frontiers—power entering through peripheral nodes (Seljuk from steppe, Ottoman from Anatolia). Legitimacy remains Islamic whether Islam extends outward or power enters inward through frontier nodes.

**Mercouris derivation**: Civilizational memory and legitimacy grammar; how Islam encodes frontier experience; transmission logic bidirectional.

**Mearsheimer derivation**: Structural constraints (maritime reach without demographic depth, oasis geography, chokepoint logic, steppe mobility) condition when cultural continuity survives or fails under strategic pressure.

Activation Trigger: Interpretation of MEM–ISLAM–GEO–* or MEM–ISLAM–DYNASTY–* or other Islam frontier MEMs
Affected File Classes: MEM–ISLAM–GEO–*, MEM–ISLAM–DYNASTY–*, CIV–CORE–ISLAM diagnostic outputs
Derivation: ENTRIES 0001, 0002, 0003 (GEO); ENTRIES 0009, 0010 (dynasty); SYNTHESIS 0001, 0004

Status: PROPOSED — Phase I; NOT BINDING. Requires explicit user authorization for Phase II binding.

RLL–ISLAM–0002 (CANDIDATE)
Scope: Islam civilization; cross-civilizational encoding; Constantinople / conquest events
Constraint Type: Legitimacy dependency / CCM awareness

Constraint Statement:
When the same conquest or civilizational transition is encoded across multiple civilizations, legitimacy-divergence is expected: each civilization foregrounds its own legitimacy grammar (arrival, continuity, inherited loss, failure-and-transfer). Liability distribution, structural variables, and encoding valence will diverge. CCM treats this as emergent realism (modeling misperception), not contradiction. Islam MEMs documenting such events (e.g., Constantinople 1453, Sicily) should cite civilization-contrast sources (e.g., Gibbon) where external encodings illuminate divergence.

**Mercouris derivation**: Legitimacy grammar; how civilizations encode shared events differently; structure explains conditions, legitimacy explains encoding.

**Mearsheimer derivation**: Structural variables (force ratio, choke point, defection) condition outcomes; legitimacy encoding follows but does not determine material reality.

**Barnes derivation**: Liability chains distribute differently across encodings; no encoding assigns primary liability to the conqueror in self-description.

Activation Trigger: MEM–ISLAM documenting conquest, imperial transition, or civilizational interface where other civilizations have counterpart MEMs
Affected File Classes: MEM–ISLAM–CONSTANTINOPLE, MEM–ISLAM–GEO–*, cross-civilizational MEMs
Derivation: SYNTHESIS 0002 (0004–0006 + Gibbon); ENTRIES 0004, 0005, 0006; CANDIDATE BELIEF 0001

Status: PROPOSED — Phase I; NOT BINDING. Requires explicit user authorization for Phase II binding.

RLL–ISLAM–0003 (CANDIDATE)
Scope: Islam civilization; MEM authoring; civilization-contrast citation
Constraint Type: Legitimacy dependency / scholarly discipline

Constraint Statement:
When MEM–ISLAM documents war, command, conquest, civilizational interface, or world-order / Westphalian interface, cite Keegan, Gibbon, Kissinger, Lewis, or Phillips for civilization-contrast where relevant. Five-pole pool (SYNTHESIS 0005): Gibbon (Roman/Christian historiography—Sicily, Crusades, Constantinople); Lewis (jihad/structural—ARC–ISLAM); Phillips (Saladin reception, mercy, paradox); Kissinger (world-order, Westphalian contrast, Ottoman); Keegan (military historiography—institutional restraint, command philosophy, soldier experience; repository corpus). For war/command/battle MEMs: Keegan recommended. For world-order, caliphate, Westphalian interface: Kissinger recommended. Contrast citation illuminates encoding divergence—Islam's legitimacy grammar versus external structural/legitimacy encoding—without resolving it. CCM treats divergence as expected. Citation is recommended, not mandatory; applicability judged per MEM subject.

**Mercouris derivation**: Legitimacy encoding; structure explains conditions, legitimacy explains encoding; contrast enriches.

**Mearsheimer derivation**: Structural variables (force ratio, formation, naval dominance) condition outcomes; contrast surfaces gaps.

**Barnes derivation**: Liability distribution differs across encodings; contrast exposes mechanism variation.

Activation Trigger: Authoring or revising MEM–ISLAM that treats war, command, conquest, Crusades, Constantinople, Saladin, civilizational military interface, or world-order / Westphalian interface
Affected File Classes: MEM–ISLAM–CRUSADES, MEM–ISLAM–SALADIN, MEM–ISLAM–CONSTANTINOPLE, MEM–ISLAM–DYNASTY–*, MEM–ISLAM–GEO–* (where war/command relevant); MEM–ISLAM–CALIPHATE–ABOLITION, world-order MEMs

XVIII.B. CANDIDATE BELIEF STAGING (PHASE I — NON-BINDING)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

CANDIDATE BELIEF 0001
Derived From:
• Gibbon, *Decline and Fall* Ch. LVI (Sicily, Saracens, Normans), Ch. LIX (Crusades, Saladin), Ch. LXVIII (Constantinople 1453); LEARN-mode tri-frame analysis (Mercouris, Mearsheimer, Barnes) on Gibbon Sicily + Constantinople + Crusades

Belief Statement:
Gibbon’s treatment of Islamic expansion and retreat (Sicily, Crusades/Saladin, Constantinople 1453) is a legitimacy-saturated narrative: he encodes collapse and conquest through the failure and transfer of legitimacy (Byzantine schism, Latin non-coordination, Saracen divisions, crusader fragmentation, Ottoman conquest + institutional accommodation), not only through force. The tri-frame (Mercouris legitimacy, Mearsheimer structure, Barnes liability) applies to Gibbon as civilization-contrast source: each frame surfaces different aspects of the same encoding. CCM treats Gibbon’s Roman/Christian encoding versus Islamic civilizational encoding as expected divergence, not contradiction. Civilization-contrast scope: Ch. LVI (Sicily), Ch. LIX (Crusades, Saladin), Ch. LXVIII (Constantinople 1453).

XVIII.C. ARC–DISCOVERY PROPOSALS (PHASE I — FOR ARC UPGRADE)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

ARC–DISCOVERY PROPOSAL 0001 — Baer & Phillips (Ottoman, Saladin)

**Source 1:**
• Marc David Baer, *The Ottomans: Khans, Caesars, and Caliphs* (Basic Books, 2021)

**Justification:**
Ottoman historiography; Ottomans as European-integrated; triple heritage (Khans/Caesars/Caliphs); conversion-as-elite-making; 19th C exclusivity → genocide → collapse. MEM–ISLAM–DYNASTY–OTTOMAN would gain: European integration thesis, late-Ottoman trajectory, conversion mechanics. ENTRY 0012; SYNTHESIS 0004.

**Source 2:**
• Jonathan Phillips, *The Life and Legend of the Sultan Saladin* (Yale University Press, 2019)

**Justification:**
Saladin historiography; paradox of Western admiration; mercy as defining trait; modern appropriation (Arab nationalist, Islamist, popular culture). MEM–ISLAM–SALADIN would gain: reception-history, paradox-of-admiration pole, specific mercy anecdotes. Complements Lewis (jihad/structural). ENTRY 0013; SYNTHESIS 0003.

**Proposed ARC Category:** ARC-T-MODERN (both authors; contemporary scholarship)

**Upgrade Type:** ADDITIVE — Two authors; requires CIV–ARC–ISLAM version bump (v1.1 → v1.2)

**Status:** IMPLEMENTED — CIV–ARC–ISLAM v1.2 (2026-02); Baer and Phillips added to ARC-T-MODERN.

ARC–DISCOVERY PROPOSAL 0002 — Kissinger (World Order / civilization-contrast)

**Source:**
• Henry Kissinger, *World Order* (Penguin Press, 2014)

**Justification:**
Civilization-contrast citation for MEMs treating world-order, Westphalian interface, caliphate, Ottoman expansion, or Islamic order vs sovereign equality. Kissinger supplies realist/statecraft lens: Islam as one of four historical world orders; divinely ordained domestic principles; non-Muslim entities illegitimate as equal counterparts; unitary Islamic entity vs equilibrium of competing parts; Ottoman–Westphalia contrast (Mehmed's "one empire, one faith, one sovereignty"); Iran 1979 as transcending Westphalian system. ENTRY 0014; SYNTHESIS 0002; RLL–ISLAM–0003 (recommended source). Mearsheimer derivation: incentive structure, balance-of-power logic, structural incompatibility.

**Proposed ARC Category:** ARC-T-MODERN (contemporary statecraft scholarship)

**Upgrade Type:** ADDITIVE — One author; civilization-contrast only; requires CIV–ARC–ISLAM version bump (v1.2 → v1.3)

**Status:** IMPLEMENTED — CIV–ARC–ISLAM v1.3 (2026-02); Kissinger added to ARC-T-MODERN.
