COGNITIVE DECLARATION (GEO–MEM)
This GEO–MEM expresses MEARSHEIMER STRATEGIC COGNITION. Strategic analysis (~2/3); ARC verbatim quotes (~1/3).

I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
This file preserves the Strait of Malacca as Islam's **eastern chokepoint and transmission gateway**: the narrow waterway (~890 km; ~2.8 km at narrowest) connecting the Indian Ocean to the South China Sea—the primary route for East–West maritime trade and the gateway through which Islam entered the Malay–Indonesian sphere. CIV–CORE–ISLAM § IV: "Maritime Islam (Malay–Indonesian sphere)." Malacca is one of three primary chokepoints (with Bab el-Mandeb, Hormuz) governing Islamic littoral access. Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

II. GEOGRAPHIC PARAMETERS
Strait of Malacca: between Malay Peninsula (west) and Sumatra (east). Connects Andaman Sea (Indian Ocean) to South China Sea (Pacific approach). ~25% of world seaborne trade (2020s); ~15 million barrels/day oil transit. Structural axiom: Control of Malacca = control of Indian Ocean–Pacific linkage. No equivalent alternative (Sunda Strait is secondary; longer route). Closure would force diversion around Indonesia; compress global trade flows.

III. CHOKEPOINT LOGIC & POWER DISTRIBUTION
Littoral states: Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore. No Islamic state holds sole control; sovereignty shared. Singapore: strategic node; US-friendly. China: Malacca Dilemma—dependency on passage for energy imports. Power distribution: Littoral states govern transit; extra-regional navies (US, China) project into corridor. Defense balance: Closure possible (piracy, blockade); denial easier than keeping open under conflict.

IV. SULTANATE OF MALACCA & ISLAMIC TRANSMISSION
Sultanate of Malacca (1400–1511): Major Islamic port-state; conversion of ruler (Parameswara) to Islam; hub for Indian Ocean–South China Sea trade. Gateway for Islam's spread to Sumatra, Java, Malay Peninsula. Thomas Arnold, *The Preaching of Islam* (ARC–ISLAM–T–EARLY-MOD):

"Islam had just gained a footing in the island of Sumatra and was just about to commence its triumphant progress through the islands of the Malay Archipelago."

Portuguese capture (1511): Afonso de Albuquerque seizes Malacca; disrupts Islamic maritime primacy in eastern Indian Ocean. Dutch (1641), British (1824) follow. Colonial control of chokepoint precedes modern sovereignty.

V. TRANSMISSION VECTOR
Islamic expansion through Malacca followed **trader and preacher** routes—not conquest. Arnold: "the quiet, unobtrusive labours of the preacher and the trader." Malacca as port-city; merchants; Sufi networks; peaceful adoption. MEM–ISLAM–GEO–INDIAN–OCEAN: Same transmission logic for East African, Indian, Southeast Asian littorals.

VI. CONTROL SEQUENCE
Pre-Islam: Srivijaya; regional. Sultanate of Malacca: 1400–1511 (Islamic). Portuguese: 1511–1641. Dutch: 1641–1824. British: 1824–1957 (Malaya). Modern: Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore (sovereign); international transit regime.

VII. GEO STRUCTURED DATA (LAYER 2)
REGION_BOUNDS: ~1–6N, 98–104E; ~890 km length. TERRAIN: Maritime; narrow strait. CHOKEPOINT: Yes—Indian Ocean to South China Sea; primary East–West corridor. KEY_FEATURES: Narrowest ~2.8 km; Singapore at southern end; piracy risk zones.

VIII. MEM CONNECTIONS
MEM–ISLAM–GEO–INDIAN–OCEAN; MEM–ISLAM–GEO–PACIFIC–OCEAN; CIV–CORE–ISLAM § IV. Breaks if removed: Indian Ocean MEM Malacca chokepoint reference; Maritime Islam gateway.

IX. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS
Malacca = eastern choke of three (with Bab el-Mandeb, Hormuz). Transmission gateway for Malay–Indonesian Islam. Portuguese 1511 = disruption of Islamic maritime primacy. No Islamic state controls strait today.
