────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves Sunni Islam as **Islam’s legitimacy-through-continuity
architecture**: the tradition that stabilizes the ummah by prioritizing
communal cohesion, inherited practice, and scalable legal authority over
charismatic or genealogical claims.

Sunni Islam is not a sect of protest.
It is the **default operating system of Islamic civilization**.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. SUCCESSION AS PRAGMATIC NECESSITY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Sunni identity crystallizes immediately after Muhammad’s death.

Core position:
• Leadership is required to prevent fitna
• Revelation is closed; governance is human
• Consensus (*ijma‘*) outweighs lineage

Abu Bakr’s selection establishes precedent:
legitimacy arises from **communal agreement under necessity**.

Order is preserved even if perfection is impossible.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. SUNNA AS CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Sunna functions as lived continuity.

Characteristics:
• Emulation of prophetic practice
• Collective transmission over time
• Behavior precedes doctrine

Authority flows through:
Prophet → Companions → Community

This transforms memory into governance.
Islam survives not through myth, but repetition.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. LAW OVER CHARISMA
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Sunni Islam routinizes authority through law.

Key developments:
• Emergence of legal schools (madhahib)
• Scholarly class (*ulama*) as legitimacy mediators
• Rulers as executors, not sources, of law

No individual monopolizes truth.
Legitimacy disperses across institutions.

This prevents collapse when rulers fail.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. CALIPHATE AS FUNCTION, NOT SANCTITY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Sunni caliph is a custodian, not a vessel of divine authority.

Principles:
• Moral fallibility acknowledged
• Obedience preferred to chaos
• Rebellion discouraged unless order collapses

This creates a **bias toward endurance**.

Sunni Islam survives bad rulers
by refusing to sacralize them.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. EMPIRE COMPATIBILITY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Sunni doctrine scales with empire.

Traits:
• Flexible jurisprudence
• Tolerance for administrative plurality
• Non-essentialist political theory

Empires rise and fall.
Sunni Islam remains intact.

Legitimacy is portable.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. MODERN RESILIENCE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
In the post-caliphate world, Sunni Islam fragments institutionally
but not civilizationally.

Continuities:
• Ritual uniformity
• Legal reasoning traditions
• Moral language shared across states

Absence of a caliph does not end Sunni Islam.
It **confirms its design**.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VIII. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Continuity can be stronger than purity.
• Law stabilizes communities when charisma fades.
• Legitimacy survives when it is distributed.
• Order is treated as a moral good, not a concession.
• Sunni Islam is designed to endure imperfect history.

Tension preserved without verdict.

IX. SOURCE EVIDENCE — LEWIS (ARC–ISLAM)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Bernard Lewis, *The Political Language of Islam* (1988); *Journal of Democracy* 7.2 (1996) (ARC–ISLAM–T–MODERN):

"The central institution of sovereignty in the traditional Islamic world, the caliphate, is defined by the Sunni jurists to have contractual and consensual features that distinguish caliphs from despots. The exercise of political power is conceived and presented as a contract, creating bonds of mutual obligation between the ruler and the ruled."

"The contract can be dissolved if the ruler fails to fulfill or ceases to be capable of fulfilling his obligations."

"One of the sayings traditionally ascribed to the Prophet is the remark, 'Difference of opinion within my community is a sign of God's mercy.' In other words, diversity is something to be welcomed, not something to be suppressed. This attitude is typified by the acceptance by Sunni Muslims, even today, of four different schools of Islamic jurisprudence."

"By Ottoman custom, when the sultan received the chief dignitaries of the state on holy days, he stood up to receive them as a sign of his respect for the law. When a new sultan was enthroned, he was greeted with cries of 'Sultan, be not proud! God is greater than you!'"

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
X. SOURCE EVIDENCE — BAER (ARC–ISLAM)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Marc David Baer, *The Ottomans: Khans, Caesars, and Caliphs* (Basic Books, 2021) (ARC–ISLAM–T–MODERN):

"The Ottomans pioneered religious toleration even as they used religious conversion to integrate conquered peoples."

— Baer on Ottoman Sunni custodianship; millet system; toleration-and-conversion dialectic as governance model under Sunni umbrella.
