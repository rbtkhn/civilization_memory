I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
This file preserves Hulegu as Islam's **caliphal destroyer**: the Mongol prince (grandson of Genghis Khan) who eradicated the Assassins (1256), sacked Baghdad (1258), executed the Abbasid caliph, and founded the Ilkhanate—the figure through whom external conquest terminates five centuries of Abbasid rule in the capital.

For Islam, Hulegu encodes: the conqueror who ended Baghdad; the installer of Persian Muslim administration (Juvaini); the non-Islamic sovereign who ruled Islamic space before conversion. He is the agent of civilizational rupture.

II. ORIGINS & MANDATE
Hulegu (Hulagu) is the son of Tolui, grandson of Genghis Khan; brother of Mongke (Great Khan) and Khubilai. Mongke dispatches him (1253) for the western campaign: subjugate the Assassins, then the Abbasid realm. Hulegu commands a coalition including Christian and Muslim allies. The campaign is Mongol imperial policy, not freelance conquest.

III. ASSASSINS & BAGHDAD SEQUENCE
Weatherford, "Restoring Order," Asia-Pacific Journal (2007) (ARC–ISLAM–T–MODERN):

"The legal justification for the Mongol invasion of Iraq derived from the reluctance of the caliph of Baghdad to control the Shiite Cult of the Assassins, whom the Mongols accused of attempting to kill their khan."

"The assassins operated from a series of fortified mountain camps spread from contemporary Afghanistan to Iraq, and the Baghdad invasion did not begin until the Mongols had eradicated the threat from the assassins and destroyed their fortresses."

Hulegu destroys Alamut and Assassin strongholds (1256). Then advances on Baghdad. Siege (1258); city falls; caliph executed. Encoding: Assassins first, then caliphate—sequence matters for legal and strategic logic.

IV. EXECUTION & ADMINISTRATION
Weatherford ("Restoring Order," 2007):

"The Mongols also immediately executed the caliph and his sons on charges that they spent too much money on their palaces and not enough defending their nation."

"In Baghdad, Hulegu installed a government under Ata Malik Juvaini, a devout Persian Muslim, who governed for most of the next 20 years and whose writings survive as some of the great scholarly works of the Muslim world."

Hulegu rules through indigenous elites. He does not claim Islamic legitimacy; he claims Mongol sovereignty. The caliphate relocates to Cairo (Mamluk custody); Baghdad becomes Ilkhanid.

V. AYN JALUT & WESTERN LIMIT
Hulegu withdraws east (1260) on Mongke's death; leaves Kitbuqa in Syria. Mamluks defeat Kitbuqa at Ayn Jalut. Hulegu never returns to complete the Levant conquest. The Nile–Damascus axis holds. Encoding: Hulegu is the destroyer of Baghdad, not the conqueror of Cairo. His western limit is set at Ayn Jalut.

VI. FOUNDER OF ILKHANATE
Hulegu establishes the Ilkhanate (1256–1265); his line rules until 1335. He does not convert to Islam; his great-grandson Ghazan does (1295). Hulegu remains the pagan destroyer who installs Muslim administrators—power without Islamic grammar.
