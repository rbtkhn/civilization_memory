COGNITIVE DECLARATION (GEO–MEM)
This GEO–MEM expresses MEARSHEIMER STRATEGIC COGNITION. Strategic analysis (~2/3); ARC verbatim quotes (~1/3).

I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
This file preserves the Euphrates as Islam's **Mesopotamian artery and Shi'a sacred corridor**: the river (~2,800 km) that with the Tigris defines the Fertile Crescent—a zone where Karbala (680) and Najaf anchor Shi'a sacred geography, and where the river links Syria to Iraq. CIV–CORE–ISLAM § IV: "Mesopotamia." For Islam, the Euphrates is: Karbala (Husayn's martyrdom); Najaf (Ali's shrine); Kufa (early Islamic capital); Syria–Iraq axis. Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

II. GEOGRAPHIC PARAMETERS
Euphrates: Rises in Turkey; flows through Syria (Raqqa, Deir ez-Zor); Iraq (Fallujah, Karbala, Najaf, Kufa); joins Tigris at Shatt al-Arab; empties to Persian Gulf. Tigris–Euphrates basin = Mesopotamia. Structural axiom: Euphrates = **Shi'a holy cities corridor**—Karbala, Najaf. Tigris = Baghdad (Sunni Abbasid); Euphrates = southern Shi'a sacred zone. MEM–ISLAM–SHIA: "Karbala (680 AD) defines Shi'a time."

III. KARBALA & SHI'A SACRED GEOGRAPHY
Battle of Karbala (680): Husayn ibn Ali martyred; Umayyad forces block access to Euphrates water. Bernard Lewis, "The Shi'a" (ARC–ISLAM–T–MODERN):

"In their own perception, the Shi'a were the opposition in Islam, the defenders of the oppressed, the critics and opponents of privilege and power."

Karbala = legitimacy-through-martyrdom; ritualized accusation; Husayn's death as authority preserved through blood. Najaf: Shrine of Ali; Shi'a pilgrimage. Kufa: Early Islamic garrison; Ali's capital; Umayyad–Shi'a contestation. The Euphrates corridor encodes **sacred geography**—non-fungible for Shi'a identity.

IV. TIGRIS–EUPHRATES DUALITY
MEM–ISLAM–GEO–TIGRIS–RIVER: "Tigris is the Baghdad river; Euphrates the southern Shi'a holy cities corridor." Both feed Shatt al-Arab; Persian Gulf linkage. Hodgson: Gulf "linking the Indian Ocean with Mesopotamia and the Levant." Euphrates adds Syria to the corridor—Raqqa (historical); Deir ez-Zor; cross-border flow. Turkey (headwaters) = upstream control; Syria, Iraq = littoral states.

V. SYRIA–IRAQ AXIS
Euphrates crosses Syria before Iraq—historical linkage. Ottoman vilayets; French/British mandates; Ba'ath; modern fragmentation. Control of Euphrates water = agricultural and demographic leverage. Syria's Tabqa Dam; Turkey's GAP project = upstream constraint on Iraqi and Syrian flows.

VI. CONTROL SEQUENCE
Pre-Islam: Byzantine (western); Sassanid (eastern). Arab conquest: 637. Umayyad: Kufa, Karbala (680 battle). Abbasid: Baghdad on Tigris; Euphrates corridor under caliphal authority. Mongol: 1258; basin fractured. Ottoman: Vilayets. Modern: Turkey (headwaters); Syria; Iraq (Karbala, Najaf, Kufa); Iran (Shatt al-Arab).

VII. GEO STRUCTURED DATA (LAYER 2)
REGION_BOUNDS: ~38N–30N; Turkey, Syria, Iraq; ~2,800 km. TERRAIN: Riverine; Mesopotamian plain; irrigation. CHOKEPOINT: No—upstream (Turkey) can constrain flows. KEY_FEATURES: Karbala; Najaf; Kufa; Raqqa; Shatt al-Arab confluence.

VIII. MEM CONNECTIONS
MEM–ISLAM–GEO–TIGRIS–RIVER; MEM–ISLAM–SHIA; MEM–ISLAM–DYNASTY–UMAYYAD; MEM–ISLAM–DYNASTY–SAFAVID; MEM–ISLAM–GEO–PERSIAN–GULF; MEM–ISLAM–GEO–LEVANT. Breaks if removed: CIV–CORE § IV (Mesopotamia); Shi'a sacred geography.

IX. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS
Euphrates = Shi'a holy cities corridor; Karbala defines Shi'a time. Syria–Iraq axis; upstream (Turkey) = modern dependency. Tigris–Euphrates paired system.
