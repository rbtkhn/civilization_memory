COGNITIVE DECLARATION (GEO–MEM)
This GEO–MEM expresses MEARSHEIMER STRATEGIC COGNITION. Strategic analysis (~2/3); ARC verbatim quotes (~1/3).

I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
This file preserves Iberia as Islam's **lost territory** (al-Andalus): the peninsula where Islamic rule endured 781 years (711–1492) before complete reversal—encoding **recession**, not continuity. For Islam, Iberia is: western apex of Umayyad expansion; Caliphate of Cordoba; Taifa kingdoms; gradual Reconquista; fall of Granada (1492); expulsion. Al-Andalus is remembered as civilizational achievement and **irrecoverable loss**. Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

II. GEOGRAPHIC PARAMETERS
Iberia: peninsula bounded by Pyrenees (north), Atlantic (west), Mediterranean (east/south). Gibraltar: gateway from Maghreb. Structural axiom: Iberia is **terminal geography**—peninsula terminates at Atlantic; no westward expansion beyond. Islamic entry (711) via Gibraltar; exit (1492) by conquest, not negotiated withdrawal. Terrain: Meseta, coastal corridors, mountain interiors—initially favored defenders; fragmentation (Taifas) enabled Christian advance.

III. 711: CONQUEST VIA GIBRALTAR
Umayyad forces cross Strait of Gibraltar; defeat Visigoths (Guadalete); rapid conquest of peninsula. Bernard Lewis, *What Went Wrong?* (ARC–ISLAM–T–MODERN):

"For the first thousand years of its history, Islamic civilization's relationship to Christendom was one of dominance."

Iberia was the western apex. Cordoba becomes capital; Umayyad emirate, then caliphate (929). Al-Andalus = dar al-Islam's furthest west. MEM–ISLAM–DYNASTY–UMAYYAD: "Iberia to Central Asia"; "Andalusian Umayyad survival (Cordoba)" after Abbasid overthrow of Damascus line.

IV. FRAGMENTATION & RECONQUISTA
Taifa kingdoms (11th C): Fragmentation after Caliphate collapse; Christian kingdoms (Castile, León, Aragon) advance. Almoravid, Almohad interventions from Maghreb—temporary reversal, then retreat. Structural logic: Iberian geography enables Christian reconstitution in northern mountains; Islamic power depends on Maghreb reinforcement across Gibraltar. When Maghreb weakens, al-Andalus contracts.

V. 1492: GRANADA & EXPULSION
Fall of Granada (2 January 1492): Last Islamic polity in Iberia surrenders. Expulsion decrees (1492, 1502, 1609–1614): Moriscos expelled. Al-Andalus ends. Encoding: **reversal**—dominance becomes loss; 781 years of presence erased. No negotiated retention; conquest and expulsion. Lewis: Islamic civilization's relationship to Christendom reverses; Iberia is the hinge.

VI. STRATEGIC LOGIC
Gibraltar: Single point of Islamic entry and reinforcement. Control of strait by Christian powers (post-Reconquista) severs Maghreb–Iberia link. Terminal geography: Iberia cannot project Islamic power further west; it receives it from Maghreb. Loss is structural—peninsula surrounded by Christian recovery from north; Islamic depth depends on trans-Gibraltar logistics.

VII. CONTROL SEQUENCE
711: Umayyad conquest. 756: Emirate of Cordoba (Umayyad survivor). 929: Caliphate of Cordoba. 1031: Taifa fragmentation. 1086–1248: Almoravid, Almohad interventions; gradual Christian advance. 1236: Cordoba falls. 1492: Granada falls; Reconquista complete. 1609–1614: Morisco expulsion.

VIII. GEO STRUCTURED DATA (LAYER 2)
REGION_BOUNDS: Iberian Peninsula; ~36–44N, 10W–5E. TERRAIN: Meseta; coastal; Pyrenees northern boundary. CHOKEPOINT: Gibraltar (entry/exit); see MEM–ISLAM–GEO–ATLANTIC–OCEAN, MEM–ISLAM–GEO–MEDITERRANEAN–SEA. KEY_FEATURES: Gibraltar; Cordoba; Granada; Guadalquivir.

IX. MEM CONNECTIONS
MEM–ISLAM–GEO–ATLANTIC–OCEAN; MEM–ISLAM–GEO–MEDITERRANEAN–SEA; MEM–ISLAM–CORDOBA; MEM–ISLAM–DYNASTY–UMAYYAD; MEM–ISLAM–DYNASTY–UMAYYAD (Andalusian survival). Cross-civilization: MEM–ROME–GEO–IBERIA (Rome's encoding: Reconquista as recovery); MEM–ROME–SPAIN–GRANADA.

X. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS
Iberia = lost territory; reversal encoded. 781 years of presence; complete exit. Gibraltar as single reinforcement route; terminal geography. Al-Andalus as civilizational achievement and irrecuperable loss.
