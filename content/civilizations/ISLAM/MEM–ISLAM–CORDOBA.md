I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
This file preserves Cordoba as Islam's **lost caliphal capital**—the city where the Umayyad line survived after Abbasid overthrow of Damascus (750), and where al-Andalus reached its zenith under the Caliphate of Cordoba (929–1031). For Islam, Cordoba encodes: Umayyad survival; western apex of dar al-Islam; civilizational achievement; fall by Christian conquest (1236). The Great Mosque (Mezquita) endures as architectural memory; the city is **lost**. Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

II. UMAYYAD SURVIVAL & EMIRATE (756–929)
Abd al-Rahman I, sole Umayyad survivor, establishes Emirate of Cordoba (756). Bernard Lewis, "The Shi'a" (ARC–ISLAM–T–MODERN):

"Thereafter the caliphate became hereditary in two successive dynasties."

The Damascus line falls; Cordoba continues Umayyad rule. Al-Andalus = dar al-Islam's furthest west. Strategic constraint: Guadalquivir River; Cordoba as interior capital; Gibraltar as reinforcement route from Maghreb. MEM–ISLAM–DYNASTY–UMAYYAD: "Andalusian Umayyad survival (Cordoba)"—dynasty delegitimized in east, survives in west.

III. CALIPHATE OF CORDOBA (929–1031)
Abd al-Rahman III proclaims himself caliph (929)—challenging Abbasid Baghdad. Cordoba becomes **parallel caliphal capital**; no Abbasid recognition. Cultural zenith: philosophy, poetry, science; library; Great Mosque expansion. Lewis, *What Went Wrong?*: "For the first thousand years of its history, Islamic civilization's relationship to Christendom was one of dominance." Cordoba embodied that dominance in the west—largest city in Europe; multicultural; intellectual center.

IV. FRAGMENTATION & FALL (1031–1236)
1031: Caliphate collapses; Taifa kingdoms. Cordoba loses primacy; Toledo, Seville, Valencia fragment. Christian advance: Toledo (1085), Cordoba (1236). Ferdinand III of Castile captures Cordoba—Great Mosque converted to cathedral. Encoding: **conquest**, not transfer. Islamic sovereignty ends; city passes to Christian rule. No institutional handover; no successor caliphate in Iberia.
