COGNITIVE DECLARATION (GEO–MEM)
This GEO–MEM expresses MEARSHEIMER STRATEGIC COGNITION. Strategic analysis (~2/3); ARC verbatim quotes (~1/3).

I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
This file preserves the Strait of Hormuz as Islam's **energy chokepoint and Gulf egress**: the narrow waterway (~39 km at narrowest) connecting the Persian Gulf to the Gulf of Oman and Indian Ocean—the sole maritime exit for Gulf hydrocarbons and a node where Islam–Persia interface meets global energy flows. CIV–CORE–ISLAM § IV: "Hormuz -> energy/finance linkage with DPI-triggered escalation sensitivity." Hormuz is one of three primary chokepoints (with Bab el-Mandeb, Malacca) governing Islamic littoral access. Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

II. GEOGRAPHIC PARAMETERS
Strait of Hormuz: between Iran (north) and UAE/Oman (south). Connects Persian Gulf to Gulf of Oman. ~21 million barrels/day oil transit (2020s); ~25% of global seaborne oil. Structural axiom: Control of Hormuz = control of Gulf exit. No alternative maritime egress for Gulf states. Closure would sever Gulf exporters from global markets; compress urban import physics.

III. CHOKEPOINT LOGIC & POWER DISTRIBUTION
Iran: Littoral position on northern shore; ability to threaten or close Hormuz; Qeshm Island; anti-ship capabilities. GCC states: Export dependency; require external naval guarantor (US Fifth Fleet, Bahrain) or overland pipeline diversification. Defense balance: Offense-dominant—blockade and mining structurally easier than keeping Strait open under contested conditions. DPI-triggered escalation: Sacred-zone or dignity pressure amplifies willingness to threaten closure.

IV. HISTORICAL: PORTUGUESE, OTTOMAN–SAFAVID
Medieval: Kingdom of Hormuz (port-state); regional maritime control. Portuguese (1507): Albuquerque seizes Hormuz; colonial naval control. Ottoman–Safavid rivalry: Contested Gulf access. British: 19th–20th C hegemony. Modern: Iran–GCC structural tension; US naval presence. Marshall G.S. Hodgson, *The Venture of Islam*: "The Persian Gulf has been a major channel of interregional trade since before Islam, linking the Indian Ocean with Mesopotamia and the Levant." Hormuz as node in that channel.

V. ISLAM–PERSIA INTERFACE
Northern shore: Iran (Persian, Safavid heritage, Islamic Republic). Southern shore: UAE, Oman (Arab, GCC). The strait sits at civilizational seam—Islam–Persia; Sunni–Shi'a littoral divide. CIV–CORE: DPI-triggered escalation sensitivity when Hormuz is contested.

VI. CONTROL SEQUENCE
Pre-Islam: Sassanid. Early Islam: Umayyad/Abbasid. Medieval: Kingdom of Hormuz. Portuguese: 1507–1622. Safavid: 1622–18th C. British: 19th C–1971. Modern: Contested (Iran vs GCC+US); international transit regime; crisis-prone.

VII. GEO STRUCTURED DATA (LAYER 2)
REGION_BOUNDS: ~26.5N, 56–57E; ~39 km narrowest. TERRAIN: Maritime; narrow strait. CHOKEPOINT: Yes—sole Gulf egress; ~21 mb/d oil. KEY_FEATURES: Qeshm Island; Musandam Peninsula; shipping lanes.

VIII. MEM CONNECTIONS
MEM–ISLAM–GEO–PERSIAN–GULF; MEM–ISLAM–GEO–INDIAN–OCEAN; MEM–ISLAM–DYNASTY–SAFAVID; CIV–CORE–ISLAM § IV. Breaks if removed: CIV–CORE Hormuz reference.

IX. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS
Hormuz = sole Gulf maritime egress; no alternative. Iran holds structural advantage (littoral, denial capability). Energy/finance linkage with DPI-triggered escalation.
