COGNITIVE DECLARATION (GEO–MEM)
This GEO–MEM expresses MEARSHEIMER STRATEGIC COGNITION. Strategic analysis (~2/3); ARC verbatim quotes (~1/3).

I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
This file preserves the Caucasus as Islam's **northern frontier and Ottoman–Safavid contested zone**: the mountain barrier (~1,200 km Black Sea–Caspian) where Islamic polities (Abbasid, Seljuk, Ottoman, Safavid) encountered steppe, Persia, and Russia—and where Muslim populations (Azerbaijan, Dagestan, Chechnya) persist under Russian/Soviet hegemony. Bernard Lewis, *The Arabs in History*: "Islamic expansion reached Transoxiana and Caucasus; Caspian marked northern extent of sustained caliphal administration." For Islam, the Caucasus is: frontier of dar al-Islam; pass-dependent terrain; Islam–Russia interface; grievance anchor (Chechen wars, occupation). Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

II. GEOGRAPHIC PARAMETERS
Caucasus: ~1,200 km; Black Sea (west) to Caspian (east); Mount Elbrus ~5,642 m. Passes: Daryal (Georgia–Russia), Mamison, Roki; coastal strips (Black Sea, Caspian). Structural axiom: Mountain barrier **absorbs and fractures** power; no unified Islamic control ever achieved. North Caucasus: Dagestan, Chechnya, Ingushetia—Sunni; South Caucasus: Azerbaijan (Shi'a), Georgia (Christian), Armenia (Christian).

III. EARLY ISLAM & CALIPHAL FRONTIER
Abbasid: Southern Caucasus (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Shirvan) under caliphal influence; northern limit of sustained administration. Lewis: Caspian and Caucasus as extent. Seljuk: Persianate integration; passes contested. Mongols: Ilkhanate; steppe–Islamic overlap. Caucasus = frontier, not heartland—Islamic presence through vassalage and regional emirates, not direct rule.

IV. OTTOMAN–SAFAVID CONTEST
16th–18th C: Ottoman (west, Black Sea coast) vs Safavid (east, Azerbaijan, Caspian littoral). Treaties (Amasya 1555, Zuhab 1639, etc.): divide sphere; Caucasus as buffer. Azerbaijan: Shi'a; Safavid heartland; Baku. Georgia, Armenia: Christian buffer kingdoms; both empires sought clients. No Islamic polity unified the Caucasus; fragmentation favored external division.

V. RUSSIAN EXPANSION & LOSS
18th–19th C: Russian conquest of North Caucasus (Imam Shamil, 1834–1859); Russo-Persian wars cede Azerbaijan, Dagestan. Russo-Turkish wars: Ottoman cedes Black Sea coast. By 1878: Russia controls most of Caucasus. Islamic encoding: **loss**—Ottoman and Persian retreat; Muslim populations (Chechnya, Dagestan) under Russian rule. Resistance (Shamil, then Soviet-era, then Chechen wars 1994–2009) = grievance continuity.

VI. MODERN: ISLAM–RUSSIA INTERFACE
North Caucasus: Russian Federation (Chechnya, Dagestan, Ingushetia); Sunni; post-Soviet wars (Chechnya); insurgency. South Caucasus: Azerbaijan (Shi'a; Turkey-aligned); Georgia, Armenia (Christian). Nagorno-Karabakh: Armenia–Azerbaijan contest. Structural: Russia dominates North Caucasus; Turkey–Azerbaijan axis in South; Iran on southern fringe. No Islamic state controls the mountain core.

VII. STRATEGIC LOGIC
MEM–RUSSIA–GEO–CAUCASUS: "States do not pass through the Caucasus. They absorb themselves into it." For Islam: Caucasus is **defensive frontier**—terrain exhausts invaders; but Islamic polities never consolidated it. Ottoman and Safavid contested; both lost to Russia. Mountain fragmentation prevented unified dar al-Islam extension. Pass control (Daryal) = transit; Russia holds northern approaches.

VIII. GEO STRUCTURED DATA (LAYER 2)
REGION_BOUNDS: ~41N–44N; 40E–50E; ~1,200 km. TERRAIN: Mountain barrier; passes; coastal strips. CHOKEPOINT: Passes (Daryal, Mamison, Roki); coastal corridors. KEY_FEATURES: North Caucasus (Dagestan, Chechnya); South Caucasus (Azerbaijan); Daryal Pass; Baku.

IX. MEM CONNECTIONS
MEM–ISLAM–GEO–BLACK–SEA; MEM–ISLAM–GEO–CASPIAN–SEA; MEM–ISLAM–DYNASTY–OTTOMAN; MEM–ISLAM–DYNASTY–SAFAVID; MEM–ISLAM–DYNASTY–ABBASID. Cross-civilization: MEM–RUSSIA–GEO–CAUCASUS (Russia lens); MEM–PERSIA–ARMENIA. Breaks if removed: Islam's northern frontier encoding; Islam–Russia interface.

X. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS
Caucasus = northern frontier; never under unified Islamic control. Ottoman–Safavid contest; Russian conquest; Muslim populations under Russian hegemony. Grievance anchor (Chechnya, occupation).
