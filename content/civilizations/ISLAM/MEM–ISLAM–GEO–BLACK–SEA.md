COGNITIVE DECLARATION (GEO–MEM)
This GEO–MEM expresses MEARSHEIMER STRATEGIC COGNITION. Strategic analysis (~2/3); ARC verbatim quotes (~1/3).

I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
This file preserves the Black Sea as Islam's **Bosphorus-dependent basin**: an enclosed sea whose access is governed entirely by the Strait—a zone where Ottoman naval dominance (15th–19th C) gave way to Russian expansion and modern contested status. For Islam, the Black Sea is: Ottoman lake (post-1453); Bosphorus as single exit; Crimea, Caucasus, Anatolia as littoral. Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

II. GEOGRAPHIC PARAMETERS
Black Sea ~436,000 km²; enclosed; connected to Mediterranean only via Bosphorus, Sea of Marmara, Dardanelles. Bosphorus ~700 m wide at narrowest. Structural axiom: Control of Bosphorus = control of Black Sea access. No alternative maritime egress. Russia's historical drive for warm-water ports targets this choke.

III. CHOKEPOINT LOGIC
Bosphorus governs all Black Sea traffic. Ottoman control (1453–1922) made the Black Sea an Islamic lake; Russian expansion (18th–19th C) contested; Montreux Convention (1936) governs modern transit. Power distribution: Turkey holds Bosphorus; Russia holds northern littoral (Crimea, Caucasus); Ukraine, Romania, Bulgaria, Georgia share coast.

IV. OTTOMAN LAKE & IMPERIAL SUCCESSION
Marc David Baer, *The Ottomans: Khans, Caesars, and Caliphs* (2021) (ARC–ISLAM–T–MODERN):

"Indeed, the Ottoman rulers saw themselves as the new Romans." Sultan Mehmed II styled himself "caesar" after conquering Constantinople in 1453.

Constantinople (Istanbul) commands the Bosphorus. Ottoman control of the straits made the Black Sea an Ottoman lake—trade, naval presence, Crimean Khanate as vassal. Russian expansion (1774 Treaty of Kuchuk-Kainarji; 1856 Crimean War) eroded Ottoman monopoly.

V. CONTROL SEQUENCE
Pre-Ottoman: Byzantine; Genoese (Crimea). Ottoman: 1453–1774 (Ottoman lake); 1774–1922 (Russian encroachment). Modern: Montreux; NATO (Turkey); Russia (Crimea 2014). Contested basin.

VI. ARC QUOTES
Baer: Ottomans as new Romans; Constantinople 1453. Lewis, *What Went Wrong?*: Islamic civilization's dominance over Christendom for a millennium; Mediterranean and Black Sea as interfaces. Kissinger (SYNTHESIS 0006): Mehmed's "one empire, one faith, one sovereignty"—Bosphorus as pivot.

VII. GEO STRUCTURED DATA (LAYER 2)
REGION_BOUNDS: ~41N–47N; 28E–42E; ~436,000 km². TERRAIN: Maritime; enclosed. CHOKEPOINT: Yes—Bosphorus (single exit). KEY_FEATURES: Bosphorus; Crimea; Caucasus coast; Danube delta.

VIII. MEM CONNECTIONS
MEM–ISLAM–CONSTANTINOPLE; MEM–ISLAM–DYNASTY–OTTOMAN; MEM–ISLAM–GEO–MEDITERRANEAN–SEA; MEM–ISLAM–CONSTANTINOPLE. Cross-civilization: MEM–RUSSIA–* (Crimea, warm-water ports).

IX. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS
Bosphorus = single choke; controls entire basin. Ottoman lake gave way to Russian encroachment. Istanbul's strategic value is Bosphorus command.
