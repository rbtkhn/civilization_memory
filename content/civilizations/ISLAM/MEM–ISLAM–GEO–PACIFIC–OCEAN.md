COGNITIVE DECLARATION (GEO–MEM)
This GEO–MEM expresses MEARSHEIMER STRATEGIC COGNITION. Strategic analysis (~2/3); ARC verbatim quotes (~1/3).

I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
This file preserves the Pacific as Islam's **eastern maritime frontier**: the vast ocean whose western edge—the Malay–Indonesian archipelago, Philippines (Mindanao, Sulu), and eastern approaches—constitutes the furthest extension of Maritime Islam. CIV–CORE–ISLAM § IV: "Maritime Islam (Malay–Indonesian sphere)." For Islam, the Pacific interface is: Malay–Indonesian archipelago (Sumatra, Java, Borneo, Sulawesi, Maluku); transmission through trade and preaching, not conquest; Strait of Malacca as gateway. Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

II. GEOGRAPHIC PARAMETERS
Islam's Pacific interface is the western Pacific rim: Indonesia (world's largest Muslim population by country); Malaysia; southern Philippines (Mindanao, Sulu); eastern limit of dar al-Islam. The Pacific proper (~165 million km²) is largely beyond Islamic littoral—Islam occupies the archipelago gateway. Structural axiom: Malacca and Sunda straits control Indian Ocean–Pacific linkage. Archipelago geography favors transmission nodes over territorial consolidation.

III. TRANSMISSION VECTOR: TRADER & PREACHER
Thomas Arnold, *The Preaching of Islam* (ARC–ISLAM–T–EARLY-MOD):

"Islam had just gained a footing in the island of Sumatra and was just about to commence its triumphant progress through the islands of the Malay Archipelago."

"It is not in the cruelties of the persecutor or the fury of the fanatic that we should look for the evidences of the missionary spirit of Islam, any more than in the exploits of that mythical personage, the Muslim warrior with sword in one hand and Qur'an in the other,—but in the quiet, unobtrusive labours of the preacher and the trader who have carried their faith into every quarter of the globe."

Islamic expansion into the Pacific rim followed merchant and missionary routes. Sultanate of Malacca (1400–1511); Aceh; Demak; Mataram—port-states and sultanates, not conquest empires. The Pacific is **transmission space** at the edge of dar al-Islam.

IV. CHOKEPOINT DEPENDENCY
Access to the Pacific from the Indian Ocean passes through Malacca or Sunda. Control of these straits governs East–West trade flows. Portuguese seizure of Malacca (1511) disrupted Islamic maritime primacy; Dutch, British, then modern sovereignty. No Islamic state controls the straits today; Indonesia and Malaysia are littoral.

V. CONTROL SEQUENCE
Pre-Islam: Hindu–Buddhist kingdoms; Srivijaya. Early Islam: 13th C traders; Pasai, Malacca. Sultanate of Malacca: 1400–1511 (Islamic port-state). Portuguese: 1511 Malacca. Dutch/British: Colonial. Modern: Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore (sovereign); China maritime expansion (South China Sea).

VI. ARC QUOTES
Arnold: Sumatra, Malay Archipelago; trader and preacher. Hodgson: Maritime Islam; Malay–Indonesian as eastern extension. Ibn Battuta: Traveled to Samudra (Sumatra); maritime routes.

VII. GEO STRUCTURED DATA (LAYER 2)
REGION_BOUNDS: Western Pacific rim; ~0–10S, 95–130E (archipelago core). TERRAIN: Maritime; archipelago; island nodes. CHOKEPOINT: Dependent on Malacca, Sunda (see MEM–ISLAM–GEO–MALACCA–STRAIT). KEY_FEATURES: Strait of Malacca; Sunda Strait; Java Sea; South China Sea approach.

VIII. MEM CONNECTIONS
MEM–ISLAM–GEO–INDIAN–OCEAN; MEM–ISLAM–GEO–MALACCA–STRAIT; CIV–CORE–ISLAM § IV (Maritime Islam, Malay–Indonesian). Breaks if removed: CIV–CORE–ISLAM § IV (Maritime Islam sphere).

IX. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS
Pacific = eastern limit of Maritime Islam. Transmission through trade and preaching; no conquest empire. Archipelago geography favors node-logic; straits govern access.
