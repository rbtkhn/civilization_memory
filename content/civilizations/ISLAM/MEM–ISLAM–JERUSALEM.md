I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
This file preserves Jerusalem (Al-Quds) as Islam's third holiest site and legitimacy anchor—a sacred zone whose status (INTACT / PRESSURED / VIOLATED) governs DPI and FRG across the Ummah. For Islam, Jerusalem/Al-Aqsa is Qur'anically sanctified; its loss cannot be compensated. 1099 = ontological rupture; 1187 = legitimacy reanchoring. CIV–CORE–ISLAM § IV: Jerusalem / Al-Aqsa. Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

II. QUR'ANIC SANCTIFICATION
Qur'an 17:1 (ARC–ISLAM–T–ANCIENT): "Exalted is He who took His Servant by night from al-Masjid al-Haram to al-Masjid al-Aqsa, whose surroundings We have blessed, to show him of Our signs. Indeed, He is the Hearing, the Seeing." The Night Journey (Isra); al-Masjid al-Aqsa = Jerusalem. Jerusalem is a legitimacy node—custody confers authority.

III. CRUSADES: RUPTURE & RECOVERY (1099–1187)
Jerusalem's fall (1099) = ontological rupture. Lewis, The Crisis of Islam: "In the Middle East the word 'crusade' still touches a raw nerve and is seen and presented as early medieval precursors of European imperialism—aggressive, expansionist and predatory." Jerusalem's recovery (1187) reanchors legitimacy. Phillips on Saladin: "It is impossible to think of another figure from history who dealt such a deep wound to a people and a faith, and yet became so admired." Islam recovers Jerusalem without becoming what it opposed.
