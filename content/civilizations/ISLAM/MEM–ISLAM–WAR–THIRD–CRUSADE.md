I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves the Third Crusade as Islam's **chivalric encounter**:
the campaign in which Richard the Lionheart failed to retake Jerusalem
despite Acre's fall, and in which Saladin's conduct earned cross-confessional
respect—encoding mutual admiration between adversaries.

For Islam, the Third Crusade confirms:
• Jerusalem (1187) remains under Muslim control
• Mercy and restraint amplify legitimacy
• Saladin becomes admired even by his enemies

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. CONTEXT: POST-HATTIN
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Saladin's victory at Hattin (1187) and Jerusalem's recapture prompt
Western response.

Key dynamics:
• Richard I, Philip II, Frederick Barbarossa lead Crusade
• Acre falls (1191) after prolonged siege
• Richard wins at Arsuf; fails to take Jerusalem
• Negotiated settlement (Treaty of Jaffa/Ramla, 1192)

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. RICHARD–SALADIN ENCOUNTER
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Phillips documents mutual respect between Richard and Saladin.

Characteristics:
• Chivalric exchange (gifts, messengers)
• Saladin's mercy acknowledged by Crusader sources
• Richard's military prowess acknowledged by Muslim sources
• No decisive battle for Jerusalem

The war ends in stalemate—
but Saladin's conduct solidifies his reputation.

V. SOURCE EVIDENCE — PHILLIPS (ARC–ISLAM)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Jonathan Phillips, *The Life and Legend of the Sultan Saladin* (Yale University Press, 2019) (ARC–ISLAM–T–MODERN):

Phillips covers the Third Crusade—Acre, Arsuf, Richard–Saladin encounters, chivalric exchange. Saladin's "courtesy, justice, generosity, and mercy" earned respect from Richard; mutual admiration despite conflict.

"It is impossible to think of another figure from history who dealt such a deep wound to a people and a faith, and yet became so admired."

— Phillips on Third Crusade as theater where Saladin's paradox crystallizes; Richard's failure to retake Jerusalem; conduct-based legitimacy across confessional lines.

V.B. SOURCE EVIDENCE — KEEGAN (CIVILIZATION-CONTRAST)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

John Keegan, *The Mask of Command* (Jonathan Cape, 1987) — Not in ARC–ISLAM; civilization-contrast per RLL–ISLAM–0003, SYNTHESIS 0005:

"The leader of men in warfare can show himself to his followers only through a mask, a mask that he must make for himself, but a mask made in such form as will mark him to men of his time and place as the leader they want and need."

"Napoleon commanded through personal magnetism... Wellington commanded through professional competence. Napoleon's system required Napoleon; Wellington's system required only that someone competent occupy the headquarters."

"Wellington positioned himself at crisis points throughout the day... He did not inspire; he steadied. Napoleon, by contrast, remained behind the lines for much of the battle... The system that required Napoleon was operating without him."

— Keegan on command as performance; personal magnetism vs professional competence. Civilization-contrast: Richard the Lionheart (leading from front, personal bravery, Acre/Arsuf—Napoleon-like) vs Saladin (strategic patience, mercy, steadied conduct—Wellington-like). Third Crusade as encounter between two distinct command masks; mutual admiration across confessional lines reflects recognition of the other's leadership construction. Encoding divergence: Islam MEM encodes conduct-based legitimacy; Keegan supplies military command-theoretic lens.

VII. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
