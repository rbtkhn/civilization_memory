COGNITIVE DECLARATION (GEO–MEM)
This GEO–MEM expresses MEARSHEIMER STRATEGIC COGNITION. Strategic analysis (~2/3); ARC verbatim quotes (~1/3).

I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
This file preserves the Red Sea as Islam's sacred corridor and import-chokepoint: the narrow maritime system linking the Indian Ocean (via Bab el-Mandeb) to the Mediterranean (via Suez). CIV–CORE–ISLAM § IV: "Red Sea / Bab el-Mandeb -> urban import physics + enforcement leverage coupling." For Islam: pilgrimage corridor (Mecca from East Africa, India, Southeast Asia); chokepoint (Bab el-Mandeb); Suez–Gulf linkage. Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

II. GEOGRAPHIC PARAMETERS
Red Sea ~438,000 km²; bounded by Africa (west), Arabia (east); ~2,250 km Suez to Bab el-Mandeb. Bab el-Mandeb ~29 km wide. Structural axiom: Bab el-Mandeb = southern choke; Suez = northern choke. Closure compresses import physics.

III. CHOKEPOINT LOGIC
Bab el-Mandeb ~4.8 million barrels/day transit. Yemen (both coasts): littoral control. Egypt: Suez. Saudi: eastern littoral; Mecca–Medina custody. Closure easier than denial. Urban import physics depend on open transit.

IV. PILGRIMAGE & SACRED-ZONE LINKAGE
Red Sea flanks Hijaz. Lewis (via MEM–ISLAM–SALADIN): "The real counter-crusade began when the crusaders... began to harry and attack the Muslim holy lands, namely the Hijaz in Arabia, containing the holy cities of Mecca and Medina." Violation of Hijaz—reachable via Red Sea—activated mobilization.

V. CONTROL SEQUENCE
Pre-Islam: Roman–Axum. Early Islam: Umayyad/Abbasid littoral. Medieval: Mamluks; Yemeni sultanates. Ottoman: Yemen, Hejaz coast. Colonial: British (Aden, Suez). Modern: Contested (Egypt, Saudi, Yemen, Eritrea, Djibouti). No single Islamic state controlled both Bab el-Mandeb and Suez continuously.

VI. ARC QUOTES
Qur'an 30:46: winds, ships, His bounty—seafaring sanctioned. Ibn Battuta: Red Sea en route to Mecca; Jidda as pilgrimage port. Hodgson: Red Sea links Indian Ocean with Mediterranean.

VII. GEO STRUCTURED DATA (LAYER 2)
REGION_BOUNDS: ~12N–30N; 32E–44E; ~438,000 km². TERRAIN: Maritime corridor. CHOKEPOINT: Yes—Bab el-Mandeb, Suez. KEY_FEATURES: Bab el-Mandeb; Suez; Jidda; Massawa; Hodeidah.

VIII. MEM CONNECTIONS
MEM–ISLAM–GEO–INDIAN–OCEAN; MEM–ISLAM–MECCA; MEM–ISLAM–DYNASTY–MAMLUK; MEM–ISLAM–DYNASTY–OTTOMAN. Breaks if removed: CIV–CORE–ISLAM § IV.

IX. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS
Bab el-Mandeb + Suez = dual choke. Sacred-zone adjacency couples with import physics. No single Islamic state controlled full corridor.
