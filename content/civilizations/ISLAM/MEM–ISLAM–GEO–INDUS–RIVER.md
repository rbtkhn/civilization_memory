COGNITIVE DECLARATION (GEO–MEM)
This GEO–MEM expresses MEARSHEIMER STRATEGIC COGNITION. Strategic analysis (~2/3); ARC verbatim quotes (~1/3).

I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
This file preserves the Indus as Islam's **Indo-Islamic hearth and Pakistan lifeline**: the river (~3,200 km) that sustains Pakistan's Punjab and Sindh—a zone where Islamic presence dates to Arab conquest of Sindh (711), and where Mughal and successor rule anchored the Indo-Islamic belt. CIV–CORE–ISLAM § IV: "Indo-Islamic belt." For Islam, the Indus is: Pakistan's demographic and agricultural core; headwaters in disputed Kashmir; transmission corridor (trader and preacher); rule without demographic dominance (Mughal model). Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

II. GEOGRAPHIC PARAMETERS
Indus: Rises in Tibet; flows through India (Ladakh, Jammu & Kashmir), Pakistan (Punjab, Sindh); delta to Arabian Sea. Tributaries: Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi, Sutlej, Beas (Punjab = five rivers). Structural axiom: Pakistan is **Indus-dependent**—irrigation, population, agriculture. India controls headwaters (Jammu & Kashmir); Indus Waters Treaty (1960) governs allocation. Upstream constraint = structural vulnerability.

III. ARAB CONQUEST & EARLY ISLAM
Sindh conquered (711)—same year as Iberia. Muhammad bin Qasim; Brahmanabad, Multan. Islam enters South Asia via Indus corridor before Ganges. Thomas Arnold, *The Preaching of Islam* (ARC–ISLAM–T–EARLY-MOD): "the quiet, unobtrusive labours of the preacher and the trader." Indus = transmission corridor; Sufi networks; port communities (MEM–ISLAM–GEO–INDIAN–OCEAN: Gujarat, Malabar). Early Islamic presence = coastal and riverine nodes, not conquest empire.

IV. MUGHAL & INDO-ISLAMIC CONSOLIDATION
Mughal heartland: Indo-Gangetic plain; Lahore (Indus tributary region) as secondary capital. MEM–ISLAM–DYNASTY–MUGHAL: "rule without demographic dominance"; "Islam governs without demanding absorption." Indus valley = Punjab, Sindh—core of what becomes Pakistan (1947). Partition: Indus basin split; Punjab divided; Kashmir (headwaters) disputed. Pakistan = Indus state; India = upstream riparian.

V. KASHMIR & HEADWATERS
MEM–ISLAM–GEO–KASHMIR: Kashmir as grievance anchor; Indus headwaters in disputed territory. Control of headwaters = structural leverage. Indus Waters Treaty mitigates but does not eliminate upstream dependency. Kashmir dispute = water + dignity + territorial—Indus links all three.

VI. TRANSMISSION VS CONQUEST
Indian Ocean MEM: Islam in India via "trader and preacher"; Gujarat, Malabar, port communities. Indus: Arab conquest (Sindh) + transmission (Sufi, merchant). Hybrid pattern—conquest at nodes, transmission along corridors. Hodgson: Indian Ocean links to Mesopotamia and Levant; Indus is South Asian anchor of that network.

VII. CONTROL SEQUENCE
Pre-Islam: Regional (Sindh, Punjab). Arab: Sindh 711. Ghaznavid, Ghurid: 11th–12th C. Delhi Sultanate: 13th–16th C. Mughal: 16th–18th C. British: 19th–1947. Partition: India (headwaters, East Punjab); Pakistan (Punjab, Sindh). Modern: Indus Waters Treaty; Kashmir dispute.

VIII. GEO STRUCTURED DATA (LAYER 2)
REGION_BOUNDS: ~32N–36N (Pakistan); Tibet to Arabian Sea; ~3,200 km. TERRAIN: Riverine; Punjab alluvium; Sindh desert riparian. CHOKEPOINT: No—upstream (India, China) can constrain. KEY_FEATURES: Punjab (five rivers); Sindh; Karachi (delta); Kashmir headwaters.

IX. MEM CONNECTIONS
MEM–ISLAM–GEO–KASHMIR; MEM–ISLAM–DYNASTY–MUGHAL; MEM–ISLAM–GEO–INDIAN–OCEAN; CIV–CORE–ISLAM § IV (Indo-Islamic belt). Cross-civilization: MEM–INDIA–* (if exists). Breaks if removed: CIV–CORE Indo-Islamic belt; Pakistan structural dependency.

X. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS
Indus = Pakistan lifeline; Indo-Islamic hearth. Upstream (India, Kashmir) = structural vulnerability. Transmission + conquest hybrid; rule without demographic dominance.
