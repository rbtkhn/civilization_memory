COGNITIVE DECLARATION (GEO–MEM)
This GEO–MEM expresses MEARSHEIMER STRATEGIC COGNITION. Strategic analysis (~2/3); ARC verbatim quotes (~1/3).

I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
This file preserves the Atlantic as Islam's **western maritime frontier**: the ocean whose eastern littoral—the Maghreb (Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia), West Africa (Mauritania, Senegal, Gambia), and the lost gateway of al-Andalus (Iberia 711–1492)—constitutes the furthest westward extension and subsequent retreat of dar al-Islam. CIV–CORE–ISLAM § IV: "Maghreb." For Islam, the Atlantic interface is: Gibraltar as Mediterranean–Atlantic choke; Maghreb littoral; al-Andalus (lost 1492); West African Muslim coast. Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

II. GEOGRAPHIC PARAMETERS
Islam's Atlantic interface is the eastern Atlantic rim: Maghreb (North Africa); Iberia (historically al-Andalus, now lost); West African Sahel and coast (Mauritania, Senegal, Gambia, Guinea). The Atlantic proper (~106 million km²) is largely beyond Islamic littoral—Islam occupies the African and (formerly) Iberian gateway. Structural axiom: Gibraltar governs Mediterranean–Atlantic access. Maghreb coast faces open Atlantic; no equivalent to Malacca or Hormuz for Atlantic ingress.

III. GIBRALTAR & AL-ANDALUS
Islamic expansion into Iberia (711) crossed the Strait of Gibraltar—from Maghreb to al-Andalus. Umayyad conquest; Caliphate of Cordoba; Taifa kingdoms. Bernard Lewis, *What Went Wrong?* (ARC–ISLAM–T–MODERN):

"For the first thousand years of its history, Islamic civilization's relationship to Christendom was one of dominance."

Iberia was the western apex of that dominance. 1492: Fall of Granada; Reconquista complete; expulsion. Al-Andalus is **lost**—encoding reversal, not continuity. Gibraltar remains the choke; Spain controls it; Morocco faces the strait.

IV. MAGHREB LITTORAL
CIV–CORE–ISLAM § IV: "Maghreb" as civilizational node. Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia—Atlantic and Mediterranean coasts. Colonial (French, Spanish) then sovereign. Morocco: Atlantic-facing; gateway to West Africa. No Islamic naval hegemony over Atlantic; Maghreb is littoral, not maritime dominant.

V. WEST AFRICAN COAST
Mauritania, Senegal, Gambia, Guinea—Muslim-majority states on Atlantic littoral. Trans-Saharan trade linked interior to coast; Sufi brotherhoods; transmission through commerce. Different from conquest—coastal and Sahelian Islam expanded through trade and preaching. Atlantic here is **periphery**—not core to Islamic civilizational geography but part of dar al-Islam's western extent.

VI. CONTROL SEQUENCE
Pre-Islam: Roman; Byzantine; regional. Umayyad: Iberia 711; Maghreb. Al-Andalus: 711–1492 (gradual retreat). Portuguese/Spanish: 15th C Iberian Reconquista; Atlantic exploration. Colonial: French (Maghreb, West Africa); Spanish (Morocco). Modern: Sovereign Maghreb and West African states; Gibraltar (UK/Spain).

VII. ARC QUOTES
Lewis: Islamic dominance over Christendom for a millennium; reversal. Gibbon: Saracen expansion. Ibn Battuta: Traveled Maghreb; Atlantic as western limit of his journeys.

VIII. GEO STRUCTURED DATA (LAYER 2)
REGION_BOUNDS: Eastern Atlantic rim; Maghreb ~28–37N; West Africa ~10–20N. TERRAIN: Maritime; coastal; Strait of Gibraltar. CHOKEPOINT: Gibraltar (Mediterranean–Atlantic); see MEM–ISLAM–GEO–MEDITERRANEAN–SEA. KEY_FEATURES: Strait of Gibraltar; Maghreb coast; West African littoral.

IX. MEM CONNECTIONS
MEM–ISLAM–GEO–MEDITERRANEAN–SEA; MEM–ISLAM–GEO–IBERIA; MEM–ISLAM–DYNASTY–UMAYYAD; CIV–CORE–ISLAM § IV (Maghreb). Breaks if removed: CIV–CORE Maghreb; western frontier encoding.

X. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS
Atlantic = western limit of historic dar al-Islam. Al-Andalus lost; Maghreb remains. Gibraltar governs Mediterranean–Atlantic; no Islamic control. Reversal encoded (1492) not expansion.
