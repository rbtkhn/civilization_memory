I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
This file preserves the Assassins (Nizari Ismailis) as Islam's catalyst for Mongol invasion: the Shi'a sect that established a state of mountain fortresses, used political assassination as sovereign tool, and whose existence furnished the legal justification for Hulegu's campaign against Baghdad (1258).

For Islam, the Assassins represent legitimacy contest (Nizari imam vs Sunni caliph), elimination by external force (Mongols), and structural role as trigger for caliphal destruction. Grounds: MEM–ISLAM–MONGOL–EMPIRE; Weatherford (ARC). Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

II. ORIGINS & STRUCTURE
Nizari Ismailis break from Fatimid Cairo (1094); establish state in Alamut (Persia) and Syrian castles. Ruled by Imam; fida'in conduct targeted assassinations. Assassination as sovereign instrument. MEM–ISLAM–DYNASTY–FATIMID: Fatimid schism produces Nizari line. Saladin confronts Assassins.

III. MONGOL LEGAL JUSTIFICATION
Jack Weatherford, "Restoring Order: Conquering Iraq in the 13th and 21st Centuries," Asia-Pacific Journal (2007) (ARC–ISLAM–T–MODERN):

"The legal justification for the Mongol invasion of Iraq derived from the reluctance of the caliph of Baghdad to control the Shiite Cult of the Assassins, whom the Mongols accused of attempting to kill their khan."

"The assassins operated from a series of fortified mountain camps spread from contemporary Afghanistan to Iraq, and the Baghdad invasion did not begin until the Mongols had eradicated the threat from the assassins and destroyed their fortresses."

Encoding: The Assassins supply the casus belli. Mongol campaign sequence: Assassins first, then Baghdad. The caliph's failure to act against the Assassins becomes legal pretext for conquest.

IV. ERADICATION & CONSEQUENCE
Hulegu destroys Assassin strongholds (1256). Alamut falls. The Nizari state is eliminated. No Islamic polity defends it. Their destruction precedes and enables the march on Baghdad. Structural logic: External conquest removes a sect that internal Islamic powers could not eliminate.

V. MEMORY ENCODING
The Assassins are remembered as: legitimacy outlier; sovereign use of assassination; catalyst for Mongol invasion of the Islamic heartland; eliminated by external force. No civilizational reclamation.

VI. STRUCTURED DATA (LAYER 2)
SECT: Nizari Ismaili (Shi'a). CORE_TERRITORY: Alamut (Persia); Syrian castles. ERADICATION: 1256 (Hulegu). CATALYST_ROLE: Legal justification for Mongol invasion of Iraq.

VII. MEM CONNECTIONS
