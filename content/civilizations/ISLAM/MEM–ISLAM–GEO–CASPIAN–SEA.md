COGNITIVE DECLARATION (GEO–MEM)
This GEO–MEM expresses MEARSHEIMER STRATEGIC COGNITION. Strategic analysis (~2/3); ARC verbatim quotes (~1/3).

I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
This file preserves the Caspian as Islam's **northern maritime frontier**: a closed inland sea with no oceanic exit—a zone where Islamic polities (Abbasid, Seljuk, Safavid, regional khanates) encountered steppe, Persia, and Russia. For Islam, the Caspian is: northern limit of historic caliphal reach; Islam–Persia interface (southern littoral); closed basin favoring containment over projection. Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

II. GEOGRAPHIC PARAMETERS
Caspian ~371,000 km²; largest enclosed body of water; no oceanic connection. Bounded by Russia (N), Kazakhstan (N/E), Turkmenistan (E), Iran (S), Azerbaijan (W). Structural axiom: Closed sea = no naval projection to open ocean. Littoral control and legal regime matter more than maritime dominance. Resource (hydrocarbon) density concentrates strategic value.

III. HISTORICAL ISLAMIC INTERFACE
Abbasid: Southern littoral (Azerbaijan, Gilan, Mazandaran) under caliphal influence; Caspian as northern boundary. Seljuk: Persianate integration; Caspian littoral contested. Safavid: Persian control of southern coast; Islam–Persia fusion. Mongol: Ilkhanate; steppe–Islamic overlap. No Islamic state achieved Caspian-wide naval dominance; Persia and Russia have been primary littoral powers.

IV. CLOSED-SEA STRATEGIC LOGIC
Unlike Red Sea or Mediterranean, the Caspian has no chokepoint to external oceans. It functions as: buffer between Islamic heartland and steppe/Russia; resource basin (oil, gas); legal-contestation zone (status as sea vs lake; delimitation). Marshall G.S. Hodgson, *The Venture of Islam*: Northern frontiers of dar al-Islam; steppe interface; Persian and Turkic integration. Bernard Lewis, *The Arabs in History*: Islamic expansion reached Transoxiana and Caucasus; Caspian marked northern extent of sustained caliphal administration.

V. CONTROL SEQUENCE
Pre-Islam: Sassanid; steppe. Early Islam: Abbasid southern littoral. Medieval: Regional (Shirvan, Khwarazm). Safavid: Persian south. Russian: 18th C expansion; northern and western littoral. Soviet: Full northern control. Modern: Five littoral states (Russia, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Iran, Azerbaijan); legal regime contested.

VI. ARC QUOTES
Hodgson: Northern frontiers; steppe interface. Lewis: Islamic expansion limits; Transoxiana, Caucasus. Ibn Khaldun, *Muqaddimah*: Sedentary vs nomadic; steppe as recurrent challenge—Caspian littoral as frontier zone.

VII. GEO STRUCTURED DATA (LAYER 2)
REGION_BOUNDS: ~36N–47N; 46E–54E; ~371,000 km². TERRAIN: Maritime; closed; inland. CHOKEPOINT: No—closed basin; no oceanic exit. KEY_FEATURES: Southern littoral (Iran, Azerbaijan); Volga delta; hydrocarbon zones.

VIII. MEM CONNECTIONS
MEM–PERSIA–GEO–CASPIAN (Persia lens; cross-civilization); MEM–ISLAM–DYNASTY–ABBASID; MEM–ISLAM–DYNASTY–SELJUK; MEM–ISLAM–DYNASTY–SAFAVID; MEM–ISLAM–SILK–ROAD (northern route). Cross-civilization: MEM–RUSSIA–*, MEM–PERSIA–*.

IX. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS
Closed sea rewards containment; no projection to open ocean. Islam–Persia interface on southern littoral. Legal ambiguity as strategic space.
