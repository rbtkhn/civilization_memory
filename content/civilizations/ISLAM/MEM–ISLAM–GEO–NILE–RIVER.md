COGNITIVE DECLARATION (GEO–MEM)
This GEO–MEM expresses MEARSHEIMER STRATEGIC COGNITION. Strategic analysis (~2/3); ARC verbatim quotes (~1/3).

I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
This file preserves the Nile as Islam's strategic chokepoint and caliphal hearth: the river system (~6,650 km) that sustains Egypt and Sudan. CIV–CORE–ISLAM § IV: "Nile basin." For Islam: Cairo (Fatimid, Ayyubid, Mamluk); Nile–Levant axis; sacred-zone defense; Mediterranean–Red Sea corridor. Control Egypt = control corridor between Africa and Levant. Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

II. GEOGRAPHIC PARAMETERS
Nile: White Nile + Blue Nile converge at Khartoum; flows north through Sudan, Egypt; delta to Mediterranean. Egypt is irrigation-dependent; 95%+ population along river. Structural axiom: Single chokepoint. No alternative water source. Aswan High Dam adds upstream dependency.

III. STRATEGIC LOGIC
Post-1258: Cairo–Damascus axis replaces Baghdad as Islamic heartland. SYNTHESIS 0006: Cairo as Nile chokepoint + sacred-zone defense. Control river = control grain, population, transit. Lewis: "The Fatimid caliphs... came to Egypt via North Africa." Cairo (969) on Nile; Fatimid, Ayyubid, Mamluk. Nile and Levant replace Mesopotamia as heartland.

IV. SACRED-ZONE CORRIDOR
Nile links to Levant; pilgrimage routes. Cairo–Damascus axis: Mamluk defense of Mecca, Medina, Jerusalem. Urban import physics: Egyptian cities depend on Nile water.

V. CONTROL SEQUENCE
Pre-Islam: Byzantine Egypt. Arab conquest 641. Fatimid 969–1171. Ayyubid 1171–1250. Mamluk 1250–1517. Ottoman 1517–1914. British 1882–1952. Modern: Egyptian sovereignty; Ethiopia (Blue Nile) = upstream dependency.

VI. GEO STRUCTURED DATA (LAYER 2)
REGION_BOUNDS: ~4N–31N; White Nile, Blue Nile, delta. TERRAIN: Riverine; irrigation-dependent. CHOKEPOINT: Yes—single river sustains Egypt. KEY_FEATURES: Cairo; Aswan; Delta; Khartoum.

VII. MEM CONNECTIONS
MEM–ISLAM–CAIRO; MEM–ISLAM–DYNASTY–FATIMID; MEM–ISLAM–DYNASTY–MAMLUK; MEM–ISLAM–GEO–RED–SEA; MEM–ISLAM–GEO–MEDITERRANEAN–SEA; MEM–ISLAM–GEO–LEVANT. Breaks if removed: CIV–CORE § IV (Nile basin).

VIII. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS
Nile = single chokepoint. Post-1258 heartland. Sacred-zone corridor.
