I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves Shi‘a Islam as **Islam’s legitimacy-through-justice
architecture**: the tradition that anchors authority in divinely guided
lineage, moral rectitude, and resistance to illegitimate power.

Shi‘a Islam is not a schism of doctrine.
It is a **permanent moral indictment embedded in history**.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. SUCCESSION AS SACRED BREACH
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Shi‘a identity begins with a refusal.

Core claim:
• Muhammad designated moral authority through his family
• Leadership without legitimacy is usurpation
• Injustice at the origin corrupts all outcomes

Ali is not merely bypassed.
Justice itself is displaced.

Politics becomes a theological wound.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. IMAMATE AS MORAL AXIS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Imam is not a ruler by convenience.

Characteristics:
• Divinely guided authority
• Moral and interpretive infallibility (in Twelver doctrine)
• Legitimacy independent of power

Authority does not derive from consensus.
It derives from **truth under oppression**.

Powerlessness does not negate legitimacy.
It confirms it.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. MARTYRDOM AS LEGITIMACY ENGINE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Karbala (680 AD) defines Shi‘a time.

Husayn’s death establishes:
• Suffering as proof of righteousness
• Resistance as sacred duty
• Memory as political obligation

Martyrdom is not tragedy.
It is **authority preserved through blood**.

History becomes ritualized accusation.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. OPPOSITION AS PERMANENT POSTURE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Shi‘a Islam institutionalizes dissent.

Traits:
• Suspicion of power
• Emphasis on injustice
• Expectation of betrayal

Quietism and revolt coexist.
Both are framed as ethical responses to illegitimate rule.

Endurance is not acceptance.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. OCCULTATION & DEFERRED SOVEREIGNTY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The disappearance of the Imam transforms Shi‘a politics.

Consequences:
• Authority becomes provisional
• Clerics act as deputies, not replacements
• Justice is postponed but demanded

The world is fallen.
Redemption is future.

This produces **strategic patience with moral intensity**.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. MODERN REACTIVATION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Modern Shi‘a movements reactivate dormant sovereignty.

Features:
• Clerical political leadership
• Fusion of martyr memory and state power
• Persistent revolutionary legitimacy

When Shi‘a Islam governs,
it does so as **corrective history**, not normal politics.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VIII. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Justice can anchor legitimacy without power.
• Memory can function as permanent resistance.
• Martyrdom outlives empires.
• Authority deferred becomes morally intensified.
• Shi‘a Islam transforms loss into political permanence.

Tension preserved without verdict.

IX. SOURCE EVIDENCE — LEWIS (ARC–ISLAM)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Bernard Lewis, "The Shi'a," *The New York Review of Books* (15 August 1985) (ARC–ISLAM–T–MODERN):

"In principle, the Shi'ite philosophy is the exact opposite. After the death of the Prophet, and still more after the murder of Ali thirty years later, history in the Shi'ite view took a wrong turning, and the Muslim community has, so to speak, been living in sin ever since."

"For the Sunni, obedience to authority is a divine commandment. For the Shi'ite, obedience to the existing authority is a political necessity, to be given only as long as it cannot be avoided."

"In their own perception, the Shi'a were the opposition in Islam, the defenders of the oppressed, the critics and opponents of privilege and power."

"While the Sunni caliph exercised religious but not spiritual authority, the Shi'ite imam was accorded a spiritual status by his followers, who saw in him the continuing embodiment of God's guidance to the believers."

"As one imam pretender after another followed the path of insurrection and defeat, they acquired, in the perception of their followers, an almost Christ-like quality, with the related themes of betrayal and suffering, passion and martyrdom, and even, ultimately, return."
