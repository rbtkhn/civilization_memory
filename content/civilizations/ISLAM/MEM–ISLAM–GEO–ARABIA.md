COGNITIVE DECLARATION (GEO–MEM)
This GEO–MEM expresses MEARSHEIMER STRATEGIC COGNITION. Strategic analysis (~2/3); ARC verbatim quotes (~1/3).

I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
This file preserves Arabia as Islam's **sacred origin and peninsula hearth**: the landmass (~3.2 million km²) containing the Hijaz (Mecca–Medina), Najd, Yemen, Oman, and the Gulf littoral—where revelation occurred and from which Islamic expansion radiated. CIV–CORE–ISLAM § IV: "Hijaz–Gulf." For Islam, Arabia is: non-fungible origin; pilgrimage destination; polycentric legitimacy anchor (no single state arbitrates Ummah); resource-scarce until oil (20th C). Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

II. GEOGRAPHIC PARAMETERS
Arabia: peninsula bounded by Red Sea (west), Persian Gulf (east), Arabian Sea / Indian Ocean (south), Levant–Mesopotamia (north). Land bridge: north only—to Syria, Iraq. Interior: Najd plateau; Rub' al-Khali (Empty Quarter); desert constrains overland projection. Structural axiom: Peninsula is **defensible but resource-scarce**—coastal littorals (Hijaz, Gulf, Yemen, Oman) concentrate population and trade; interior tribal until Saudi consolidation (20th C).

III. HIJAZ AS SACRED CORE
Hijaz: Mecca, Medina. Revelation; Hijra; Constitution of Medina. Bernard Lewis (via MEM–ISLAM–SALADIN): "the Muslim holy lands, namely the Hijaz in Arabia, containing the holy cities of Mecca and Medina." Violation of Hijaz activates Dignity Supremacy Law (CIV–CORE § I.6). Arabia = container; Hijaz = core. MEM–ISLAM–MECCA; MEM–ISLAM–MEDINA.

IV. EXPANSION RADIUS
Early Islam: Conquest radiates from Medina—Levant, Mesopotamia, Egypt, Persia. Caliphates (Umayyad, Abbasid) move capital north (Damascus, Baghdad) but retain Hijaz custody as legitimacy anchor. Arabia supplies manpower and legitimacy; it does not retain political center. Marshall G.S. Hodgson, *The Venture of Islam*: Arabian tribes as early conquest vectors; peninsula as origin, not seat.

V. REGIONAL FRAGMENTATION
Yemen: Pre-Islamic kingdoms (Saba, Himyar); early Islam; Zaydi imamate; Ottoman–British contest. Oman: Ibadi; maritime (Indian Ocean); distinct sectarian identity. Najd: Wahhabi–Saudi emergence (18th C); consolidation (20th C). Gulf littoral: Tribal; British protection; oil state formation. No unified Arabian polity until Saudi Kingdom (1932).

VI. STRATEGIC LOGIC
Peninsula surrounded by water (Red Sea, Gulf, Arabian Sea); land access only from north. External projection requires maritime control (Red Sea, Hormuz) or overland corridor (Levant, Mesopotamia). Arabia cannot project power beyond littoral without external alliance or naval capability. Oil (20th C) transforms resource base—Gulf states acquire leverage; Arabia becomes energy heartland.

VII. CONTROL SEQUENCE
Pre-Islam: Tribal; Yemen kingdoms; Roman–Persian periphery. 7th C: Revelation; Hijra; conquest of Mecca; tribal submission. Rashidun: Peninsula unified under Medina. Umayyad: Damascus capital; Hijaz custody. Abbasid: Baghdad; Hijaz nominal. Ottoman: Hejaz, Yemen, Gulf coast—nominal; Sharif of Mecca; British Aden, Gulf. Modern: Saudi unification (1902–1932); Gulf states (1971); Yemen conflict.

VIII. GEO STRUCTURED DATA (LAYER 2)
REGION_BOUNDS: ~12N–32N, 35E–60E; ~3.2 million km². TERRAIN: Peninsula; desert interior; coastal littorals. CHOKEPOINT: No—contains littorals adjacent to Red Sea, Hormuz, Bab el-Mandeb. KEY_FEATURES: Hijaz; Najd; Yemen; Oman; Gulf coast; Rub' al-Khali.

IX. MEM CONNECTIONS
MEM–ISLAM–MECCA; MEM–ISLAM–MEDINA; MEM–ISLAM–GEO–RED–SEA; MEM–ISLAM–GEO–PERSIAN–GULF; MEM–ISLAM–GEO–HORMUZ–STRAIT; MEM–ISLAM–GEO–INDIAN–OCEAN; CIV–CORE–ISLAM § IV. Breaks if removed: CIV–CORE Hijaz–Gulf; Islam's sacred origin geography.

X. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS
Arabia = sacred origin; peninsula hearth. Hijaz non-fungible; Gulf oil transformed 20th C. No unified Arabian polity until Saudi; polycentric legitimacy persists.
