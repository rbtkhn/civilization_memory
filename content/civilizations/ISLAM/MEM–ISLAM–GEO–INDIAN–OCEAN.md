COGNITIVE DECLARATION (GEO–MEM)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This GEO–MEM expresses MEARSHEIMER STRATEGIC COGNITION.

GEO–MEMs contain:
• Strategic analysis (~2/3): terrain logic, power distribution, chokepoint significance
• ARC verbatim quotes (~1/3): demonstrating permanent patterns

GEO–MEMs do NOT synthesize civilizational claims or polyphonic tension.
For full civilizational narrative, see subject MEM.

I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves the Indian Ocean as Islam's **maritime highway and
transmission vector**: the vast basin (~70 million km²) connecting East
Africa, Arabia, the Persian Gulf, India, and Southeast Asia—a zone where
Islamic civilization expanded through trade, preaching, and monsoon-driven
connectivity rather than conquest alone.

For Islam, the Indian Ocean is:
• The maritime extension of dar al-Islam (East African littoral, Malay–Indonesian sphere)
• Bounded by chokepoints: Bab el-Mandeb, Hormuz, Strait of Malacca
• A transmission corridor (trader and preacher, not only warrior)

CIV–CORE–ISLAM § IV: "Red Sea / Bab el-Mandeb → urban import physics +
enforcement leverage coupling"; "Maritime Islam (Malay–Indonesian sphere)."

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. GEOGRAPHIC PARAMETERS & STRUCTURAL LOGIC
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Indian Ocean spans from the Cape of Good Hope to the Strait of
Malacca, bounded by Africa (west), Arabia and South Asia (north), Southeast
Asia (east), and Australia (southeast). Key arms: Red Sea, Persian Gulf,
Arabian Sea, Bay of Bengal.

Structural axiom:
> Monsoon winds (seasonal reversal) govern pre-steam maritime mobility.
> Control of chokepoints (Bab el-Mandeb, Hormuz, Malacca) = control of flows.

Terrain: Open ocean; monsoon-dependent routing; island nodes (Zanzibar,
Maldives, Sri Lanka, Sumatra, Java). Climate: Tropical; monsoon regime.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. CHOKEPOINT LOGIC & POWER DISTRIBUTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Three primary chokepoints affect Islamic littoral access:

| Chokepoint | Connects | Strategic Logic |
|------------|----------|-----------------|
| Bab el-Mandeb | Red Sea ↔ Gulf of Aden | Suez/Hijaz import; Yemen control |
| Hormuz | Persian Gulf ↔ Arabian Sea | Energy export; Gulf access |
| Strait of Malacca | Indian Ocean ↔ South China Sea | East–West trade; Malay world |

Power distribution:
• Pre-1500: Muslim merchants and port-states dominate western and central
  Indian Ocean; no single hegemon
• 16th C: Portuguese disrupt; seize Hormuz, Goa, Malacca
• 19th–20th C: British naval hegemony; Suez centrality
• Modern: US Fifth Fleet (Bahrain); China maritime expansion (east)

Defense balance: Maritime—projection requires naval assets; littoral
states depend on external guarantor or overland diversification for
import security.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. CONTROL SEQUENCE (HISTORICAL)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
| Era | Controller | Control Mode | Entry | Exit |
|-----|------------|--------------|-------|------|
| Pre-Islam | Roman–Indian trade; regional | Maritime | 1st C | 7th C |
| Early Islam | Umayyad/Abbasid littoral | Imperial + merchant | 7th C | 10th C |
| Medieval | Muslim port-states; Gujarati, Yemeni, Omani | Maritime | 10th C | 16th C |
| Early Modern | Portuguese | Colonial/Naval | 1498 | 17th C |
| Colonial | Dutch, British, French | Hegemon | 17th C | mid-20th C |
| Modern | Contested (US + regional powers) | Naval + sovereign | mid-20th C | Present |

Islam's maritime presence is continuous along Arabian, East African, and
Southeast Asian littorals; no single Islamic state ever controlled the
entire basin.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. TRANSMISSION VECTOR: TRADER & PREACHER
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Islamic expansion across the Indian Ocean followed **merchant and
missionary routes**, not primarily conquest.

Patterns:
• East Africa: Swahili coast; trade, conversion, sultanates
• India: Gujarat, Malabar; port communities, Sufi networks
• Southeast Asia: Sumatra, Java, Malay Peninsula; peaceful adoption
  through trade and preaching

CIV–CORE–ISLAM § IV: "Indo-Islamic belt"; "Maritime Islam
(Malay–Indonesian sphere)."

The Indian Ocean is remembered as a **flow-space** where Islam spread
through connectivity, not a dominion-space where Islam ruled by force.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. RESOURCE & URBAN SIGNIFICANCE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Pre-modern: Spice, textile, pearl, and slave trade; pilgrimage routes
(Mecca from East Africa, India, Southeast Asia).

Modern: Energy transit (Gulf via Hormuz); container shipping; fisheries;
dependence of Gulf and East African cities on maritime import rails.

Bab el-Mandeb: ~4.8 million barrels/day (2020s); closure would sever
Red Sea–Suez access for Gulf and Mediterranean traffic.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. ARC QUOTE SECTIONS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

**ARC-T-ANCIENT**
Qur'an 30:46 (ARC–ISLAM–T–ANCIENT):
"And of His signs is that He sends the winds as bringers of good tidings
and to let you taste His mercy and so the ships may sail at His command
and so you may seek of His bounty, and perhaps you will be grateful."

— Winds (monsoon) and ships as divine signs; seafaring and commerce
sanctioned; Indian Ocean trade pre-dates Islam but is Qur'anically framed.

**ARC-T-MEDIEVAL**
Ibn Battuta (1304–1368/69), *Rihla* (ARC–ISLAM–T–MEDIEVAL):
"It is easy to marry in these islands because of the smallness of the
dowries and the pleasures of society which the women offer... When the
ships put in, the crew marry; when they intend to leave they divorce their
wives. This is a kind of temporary marriage. The women of these islands
never leave their country."

— Ibn Battuta on the Maldives; ships, crew, and maritime society as
integral to the Indian Ocean Islamic world.

**ARC-T-EARLY-MOD**
Thomas Arnold (1823–1900), *The Preaching of Islam* (ARC–ISLAM–T–EARLY-MOD):
"It is not in the cruelties of the persecutor or the fury of the fanatic
that we should look for the evidences of the missionary spirit of Islam,
any more than in the exploits of that mythical personage, the Muslim
warrior with sword in one hand and Qur'ān in the other,—but in the quiet,
unobtrusive labours of the preacher and the trader who have carried their
faith into every quarter of the globe."

— Arnold on trader and preacher as transmission vectors; Indian Ocean
expansion through maritime commerce and preaching.

Also Arnold: "Islam had just gained a footing in the island of Sumatra
and was just about to commence its triumphant progress through the
islands of the Malay Archipelago."

**ARC-T-MODERN**
Marshall G.S. Hodgson, *The Venture of Islam* (ARC–ISLAM–T–MODERN):
"The Persian Gulf has been a major channel of interregional trade since
before Islam, linking the Indian Ocean with Mesopotamia and the Levant."

— Hodgson on Indian Ocean as connector; Gulf as one node in the larger
maritime system.

IX. MEM CONNECTIONS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Dependency:
• MEM–ISLAM–GEO–PERSIAN–GULF — Gulf as Indian Ocean arm; Hormuz
• MEM–ISLAM–DYNASTY–UMAYYAD — Early Arabian littoral expansion
• MEM–ISLAM–DYNASTY–ABBASID — Basra, Gulf–Indian Ocean linkage
• MEM–ISLAM–DYNASTY–OTTOMAN — Red Sea, Yemen, East African claims
• MEM–ISLAM–GEO–SICILY — Maritime Islam pattern (transmission, not conquest)

Breaks if removed:
• CIV–CORE–ISLAM § IV (Bab el-Mandeb, Maritime Islam) — This MEM grounds those references.

Cross-civilization:
• MEM–INDIA–* (if exists) — Indo-Islamic littoral
• MEM–PERSIA–* — Gulf interface
• ARC–INDIA, ARC–PERSIA — Cross-ARC for TSP MEMs

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
X. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Monsoon physics governed pre-steam maritime mobility.
• Islam spread across the Indian Ocean through trader and preacher, not conquest alone.
• Chokepoints (Bab el-Mandeb, Hormuz, Malacca) compress power; no single Islamic state controlled all three.
• Maritime Islam (Malay–Indonesian, East African) is transmission-derived.
• British then US naval hegemony replaced regional Muslim port-states.

Tension preserved without verdict.
