COGNITIVE DECLARATION (GEO–MEM)
This GEO–MEM expresses MEARSHEIMER STRATEGIC COGNITION. Strategic analysis (~2/3); ARC verbatim quotes (~1/3).

I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
This file preserves the Tigris as Islam's **Mesopotamian artery and Abbasid hearth**: the river (~1,900 km) that with the Euphrates defines the Fertile Crescent—a zone where wealth and population concentrate, and where Baghdad (762–1258) anchored Islamic civilizational consolidation. CIV–CORE–ISLAM § IV: "Mesopotamia." For Islam, the Tigris is: Baghdad; translation movement; resource concentration; 1258 Mongol destruction. Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

II. GEOGRAPHIC PARAMETERS
Tigris: Rises in Taurus (Turkey); flows through Iraq; joins Euphrates at Shatt al-Arab; empties to Persian Gulf. Tigris–Euphrates basin = Mesopotamia. Baghdad founded on Tigris (762); Basra on Shatt al-Arab. Structural axiom: Mesopotamia concentrates wealth and population. Tigris–Euphrates irrigation; Silk Road nodes (Baghdad, Merv, Nishapur). Power follows revenue. MEM–ISLAM–BAGHDAD: "Baghdad is the natural seat for resource extraction and projection toward Persia and Central Asia."

III. BAGHDAD & ABBASID CONSOLIDATION
Abbasids found Baghdad (762) on Tigris—deliberate break from Umayyad Damascus. Bernard Lewis, *What Went Wrong?* (ARC–ISLAM–T–MODERN):

"For many centuries the world of Islam was in the forefront of human civilization and achievement."

Translation movement; jurisprudence; scientific synthesis. Tigris sustains the capital of law-centered civilization. Legitimacy migrates from throne to law; the caliph becomes symbolic. River = urban life, trade, tax base.

IV. 1258: DESTRUCTION & RUPTURE
Mongol sack (1258): Tigris ran red (chroniclers); Baghdad destroyed; caliph executed. Caliphate relocates to Cairo. Jack Weatherford, *Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World* (2004) (ARC–ISLAM–T–MODERN): "The Mongol army had accomplished in a mere two years what the European Crusaders from the West and the Seljuk Turks from the East had failed to do in two centuries of sustained effort. They had conquered Baghdad, the heart of the Arab world." Weatherford ("Restoring Order," 2007): "Yet under the Mongols — and the legacy of Genghis Khan — Iraq enjoyed a century of peace and a renaissance that brought the region to a level of prosperity and cultural sophistication higher than it enjoyed before or after." Encoding: **civilizational rupture**. Lewis: "Compared with Christendom... the world of Islam had become poor, weak, and ignorant." Tigris basin shifts from heartland to periphery. Mesopotamia remains resource-rich but politically fractured.

V. TIGRIS–EUPHRATES DUALITY
Tigris and Euphrates form paired system; Shatt al-Arab confluence. Tigris: Baghdad, Mosul, Tikrit. Euphrates: Fallujah, Karbala, Najaf. Both feed Persian Gulf–Indian Ocean linkage. Hodgson: Gulf "linking the Indian Ocean with Mesopotamia and the Levant." Tigris is the Baghdad river; Euphrates the southern Shi'a holy cities corridor.

VI. CONTROL SEQUENCE
Pre-Islam: Sassanid; Byzantine (western fringe). Arab conquest: 637. Umayyad: Provincial (Kufa, Basra). Abbasid: 762–1258 (Baghdad). Mongol: 1258 destruction. Ilkhanate; Timurid; Ottoman; Safavid. Modern: Iraq (Tigris–Euphrates); Turkey (headwaters) = upstream control; Iran (Shatt al-Arab border).

VII. GEO STRUCTURED DATA (LAYER 2)
REGION_BOUNDS: ~37N–30N; Turkey to Persian Gulf; ~1,900 km. TERRAIN: Riverine; Mesopotamian plain; irrigation. CHOKEPOINT: No—river sustains; upstream (Turkey) can constrain. KEY_FEATURES: Baghdad; Mosul; Basra; Shatt al-Arab.

VIII. MEM CONNECTIONS
MEM–ISLAM–BAGHDAD; MEM–ISLAM–DYNASTY–ABBASID; MEM–ISLAM–MONGOL–EMPIRE; MEM–ISLAM–GEO–EUPHRATES–RIVER; MEM–ISLAM–GEO–PERSIAN–GULF; MEM–ISLAM–SILK–ROAD. Breaks if removed: CIV–CORE § IV (Mesopotamia).

IX. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS
Tigris = Baghdad river; Mesopotamia concentrates wealth. 1258 = rupture; heartland shifts to Nile. Upstream (Turkey) = modern dependency.
