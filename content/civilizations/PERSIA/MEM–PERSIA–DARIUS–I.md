I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves **Darius I** as Persia's imperial systematizer: the
ruler who codified Cyrus's integrative conquest into a scalable
administrative architecture. Where Cyrus established the pattern of
incorporation, Darius built the machinery of governance.

For Persia, Darius represents **administration as imperial technology**—
satrapies, Royal Road, standardized tribute, and the Behistun
legitimacy narrative that anchors Achaemenid kingship.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. ACCESSION & BEHISTUN LEGITIMACY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Darius accedes after the death of Cambyses and the suppression of
usurpers. The Behistun inscription (522–519 BC) serves as both record
and propaganda—the trilingual (Old Persian, Elamite, Babylonian)
monument establishes his claim and his piety.

The Behistun text encodes the Achaemenid ethic:

> "I am Darius the King, son of Hystaspes, an Achaemenid, a Persian,
> son of a Persian, an Aryan, of Aryan stock... By the favor of Ahuramazda
> I am of such a sort that I am a friend to what is right, I am not a
> friend to what is wrong. It is not my desire that the weak man should
> have wrong done to him by the mighty; nor is it my desire that the
> mighty man should have wrong done to him by the weak."  
> — Darius I, Behistun Inscription (DB I.13–14)

Pierre Briant frames the administrative consequence:

> "Darius's reign marks the consolidation of the imperial structure.
> The satrapal system, the standardization of tribute, and the
> development of royal ideology through inscription and relief
> create a reproducible model of governance."  
> — Pierre Briant, *From Cyrus to Alexander*

Legitimacy is inscribed before it is administered.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. SATRAPAL SYSTEM — MODULAR IMPERIAL CONTROL
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Darius formalizes the satrapy (old Persian *xšaçapāvan*, "protector of
the realm") as the primary unit of provincial governance. Civil and
military functions are separated; tribute is fixed; local elites are
co-opted under imperial oversight.

Lloyd Llewellyn-Jones contrasts Persian with Roman practice:

> "The Persians never did that. They adopted a more *laisser-faire*
> attitude and, as long as the tribute and the taxes came in, then
> they did not interfere with local systems. In fact, they encouraged
> the Persian satraps to work with local dynasts to keep the
> preexisting systems going."  
> — Lloyd Llewellyn-Jones, FiveBooks interview (2020), on *Persians: The Age of the Great Kings*

Herodotus catalogs the tribute structure:

> "The Persians have a saying that Darius was a shopkeeper, Cambyses
> a master, and Cyrus a father; for Darius made a small profit from
> everything, Cambyses was harsh and reckless, and Cyrus was gentle
> and provided for all good things."  
> — Herodotus, *Histories*, III.89

India appears as the twentieth satrapy, paying the largest tribute in gold dust:

> "The Indians made up the twentieth province. These are more in number than any nation of which we know, and they paid a greater tribute than any other province, namely three hundred and sixty talents of gold dust."
> — Herodotus, *Histories*, III.94 (trans. A.D. Godley)

Darius also commissions exploration of the Indus and the sea corridor:

> "But as to Asia, most of it was discovered by Darius. There is a river Indus... Darius, desiring to know where this Indus issues into the sea, sent ships manned by Scylax, a man of Caryanda, and others in whose word he trusted; these set out from the city Caspatyrus and the Pactyic country, and sailed down the river towards the east and the sunrise till they came to the sea; and voyaging over the sea westwards, they came in the thirtieth month to that place whence the Egyptian king sent the Phoenicians... After this circumnavigation Darius subdued the Indians and made use of this sea."
> — Herodotus, *Histories*, IV.44

Control is modular; empire governs difference as a feature.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. ROYAL ROAD & LOGISTICAL INFRASTRUCTURE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Royal Road (Sardis–Susa) and courier system enable rapid
communication and military deployment across the empire. Herodotus
describes the relay:

> "There is nothing mortal that is faster than these messengers... For
> it is said that as many days as there are in the whole journey, so
> many are the men and horses that stand along the road, each horse
> and man at the interval of a day's journey."  
> — Herodotus, *Histories*, VIII.98

Logistics precede conquest; the road is the empire's nervous system.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. MILITARY IDENTITY — BOWMAN, SPEARMAN, HORSEMAN
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Darius's tomb at Naqsh-e Rustam encodes Persian martial identity:

> "On Darius the Great's tomb inscription it says: 'I am as great a
> bowman as a spearman; I'm as great a spearman as a horseman; I am
> a great horseman.' It's those three things that set the Persians
> apart... It was the tactics of the cavalry more than anything else
> that won the Persians their victories."  
> — Lloyd Llewellyn-Jones, FiveBooks interview (2020), on *Persians: The Age of the Great Kings*

The king embodies the warrior ideal; administration and arms are one.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. GREEK FRONTIER & MARATHON
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Darius's Scythian expedition and the Ionian Revolt draw Persia into
sustained contact with the Greek world. Marathon (490 BC) ends the
first Persian invasion of mainland Greece. Llewellyn-Jones reframes
the Greek-centric narrative:

> "I've managed to write the Battle of Marathon in a sentence and a
> half, for instance. It was of very little consequence to the
> Persians."  
> — Lloyd Llewellyn-Jones, FiveBooks interview (2020), on *Persians: The Age of the Great Kings*

For Persia, Marathon is a frontier skirmish; the empire's center holds.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. SUCCESSION & TRAJECTORY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Darius names Xerxes as successor after the death of his eldest son.
The administrative template endures; the Greek frontier becomes the
inherited problem. Darius dies in 486 BC; Xerxes inherits empire and
unfinished business.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VIII. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Darius transforms Cyrus's precedent into reproducible system.
• Satrapal governance enables scale without homogenization.
• Legitimacy is inscribed and administered in tandem.
• Logistics enable empire; the Royal Road is strategic infrastructure.
• Persian encoding of Greek wars differs from Hellenic memory.

Tension preserved without verdict.
