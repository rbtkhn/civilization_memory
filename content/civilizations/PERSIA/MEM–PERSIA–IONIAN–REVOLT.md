I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves the **Ionian Revolt** from Persia's perspective: the
rebellion of Greek cities in Ionia (western Anatolia) against Persian
satraps, supported by Athens and Eretria, which culminated in the
sacking of Sardis and the burning of the temple of Cybele. Darius
suppresses the revolt; the Athenian role triggers the Marathon expedition.
The revolt encodes **satrapal governance limits**—and the costs of Greek
intervention in Persian affairs.

As the opening link in the Greek wars arc (Ionian Revolt → Marathon →
Thermopylae → Xerxes), this MEM anchors Persian memory of causation.
The structural reading: satrapal interests (Aristagoras, tyrant of Miletus)
diverge from imperial interest (Darius); Athens aligns with rebels; imperial
response follows.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. REVOLT ORIGINS — ARISTAGORAS AND ATHENIAN INTERVENTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Aristagoras of Miletus, rejected by Sparta, turns to Athens. Herodotus
records the appeal and its consequence:

> "Coming before the people, Aristagoras spoke to the same effect as at
> Sparta, of the good things of Asia, and how the Persians in war were
> wont to carry neither shield nor spear and could easily be overcome.
> This he said, and added thereto, that the Milesians were settlers from
> Athens, and it was but right to save them, being a very wealthy people;
> and there was nothing that he did not promise in the earnestness of his
> entreaty, till at last he over-persuaded them. Truly it would seem that
> it is easier to deceive many than one; for he could not deceive Cleomenes
> of Lacedaemon, one single man, but thirty thousand Athenians he could.
> The Athenians, then, were over-persuaded, and voted the sending of twenty
> ships in aid of the Ionians... These ships were the beginning of troubles
> for Greeks and foreigners."  
> — Herodotus, *Histories*, V.97

Herodotus frames Athenian involvement as fateful. From Persia's view,
external intervention transforms a satrapal rebellion into an affront
requiring imperial response.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. SARDIS TAKEN AND BURNT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
With Athenian and Eretrian ships, the Ionians march on Sardis:

> "The Ionians, having with this armament come to Ephesus, left their
> ships at Coresus... and themselves marched inland with a great host...
> they came to Sardis and took it, none withstanding them; all of it they
> took, save only the citadel, which was held by Artaphrenes himself with
> a great power."  
> — Herodotus, *Histories*, V.99–100

A soldier's fire spreads; the city burns. Herodotus records:

> "So Sardis was burnt, and therein the temple of Cybebe, the goddess of
> that country; which burning the Persians afterwards made their pretext
> for burning the temples of Hellas."  
> — Herodotus, *Histories*, V.102

Sardis is a royal city, the western terminus of the Royal Road. The
insult—and the temple destruction—demand response.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. DARIUS'S REACTION — IMPERIAL STAKES
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Herodotus records Darius's response when news reaches him:

> "But when it was told to Darius that Sardis had been taken and burnt by
> the Athenians and Ionians... at his first hearing of it (it is said) he
> took no account of the Ionians, — being well assured that they of all
> men would not go scatheless for their rebellion, — but asked who were
> the Athenians; and being told, he called for his bow, which he took, and
> laid an arrow on it and shot it into the sky, praying as he sent it aloft,
> 'O Zeus, grant me vengeance on the Athenians,' and therewithal he charged
> one of his servants to say to him thrice whenever dinner was set before
> him, 'Master, remember the Athenians.'"  
> — Herodotus, *Histories*, V.105

The Ionians are internal; Athens is the external provocateur. Imperial
memory fixes on Athenian involvement. Marathon is the execution of that
vow.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. PERSIAN SUPPRESSION — SATRAPAL VS IMPERIAL
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Darius deploys land and sea forces. Miletus falls (494 BC); the Persian
fleet defeats the Ionian navy at Lade. The revolt is crushed.

The Mearsheimer reading: satrapal governance creates friction—Greek
tyrants under Persian oversight have incentives to defect when imperial
pressure weakens. Aristagoras acts from local interest (retaining power,
exploiting Naxos failure); Athens acts from kinship and perceived
opportunity. Imperial interest is consolidation; the revolt tests—and
confirms—Persian capacity to suppress. The structural outcome: rebellion
is costly; external intervention invites retaliation. Marathon follows.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. MARATHON AS CONSEQUENCE — CAUSAL CHAIN
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Athens had burned Sardis. Darius does not forget. The Marathon expedition
(490 BC) is the punitive response. MEM–PERSIA–WAR–MARATHON documents the
battle; the Ionian Revolt is its cause. Persian memory links Athenian
insolence (supporting rebels, burning a royal city) to the need for
discipline. Xerxes inherits the unresolved Greek question.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Ionian Revolt encodes:
• Satrapal friction: Greek cities under Persian rule can rebel
• Athenian provocation: support for rebels invites Persian retaliation
• Imperial resilience: revolt is suppressed; order is restored
• Causal chain: Ionian Revolt → Marathon → Thermopylae → Xerxes

VIII. MEM CONNECTIONS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
PERSIA WAR corpus:
• MEM–PERSIA–WAR–MARATHON — Athenian punishment; causal chain; Darius's vow
• MEM–PERSIA–WAR–THERMOPYLAE — Xerxes inherits; campaign sequence
• MEM–PERSIA–WAR–ALEXANDER — Greek–Persian interface; encoding contrast
Other:
• MEM–PERSIA–XERXES — Greek question; Thermopylae, Salamis
• MEM–PERSIA–LYDIA — Sardis sacked; Royal Road terminus
• MEM–PERSIA–DYNASTY–ACHAEMENID — satrapal governance
