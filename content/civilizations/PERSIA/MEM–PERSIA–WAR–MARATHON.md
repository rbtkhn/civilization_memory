I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves **Marathon** from Persia's perspective: the 490 BC
expedition that sought to punish Athens for supporting the Ionian Revolt
and to restore the exiled tyrant Hippias. For Greece, Marathon is
foundational—the first Persian defeat, the birth of Western resistance.
For Persia, it is a **minor frontier setback**—one expedition among many,
of little consequence to imperial stability.

Lloyd Llewellyn-Jones frames the encoding divergence:

> "I've managed to write the Battle of Marathon in a sentence and a half,
> for instance. It was of very little consequence to the Persians."  
> — Lloyd Llewellyn-Jones, FiveBooks interview (2020), on *Persians: The Age of the Great Kings*

The Persian version differs from the Hellenic narrative. This MEM
preserves both—and the tension between them.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. CONTEXT — IONIAN REVOLT AND ATHENIAN INVOLVEMENT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Darius had reason to punish Athens. Herodotus records the chain of events:

> "The Athenians had sent twenty ships to aid the Ionians... and having
> disembarked, the Athenians and the rest of the allies were induced by
> Aristagoras to march against Sardis... they took the city and besieged
> the acropolis, where sat the satrap Artaphernes with a garrison."  
> — Herodotus, *Histories*, V.99–100

Athens had burned Sardis. The insult demanded response. Marathon is
Darius's punitive expedition—not a full invasion of Greece, but a
targeted strike to discipline Athens and restore Hippias.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. THE EXPEDITION — DATIS AND ARTAPHERNES
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Darius sends Datis (a Mede) and Artaphernes (his nephew) with a fleet.
Herodotus records the scale and objective:

> "So when the fleet had been got ready, they set sail for Greece...
> First they reduced the Eretrians, who did not withstand them, and
> then they sailed to Marathon."  
> — Herodotus, *Histories*, VI.94–95

The force—infantry and cavalry—lands at Marathon. Eretria has fallen;
Athens is next. The Persians expect the expedition to succeed. They
have numerical advantage, cavalry, and the psychological effect of
Eretria's capture.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. THE BATTLE — GREEK VICTORY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Athenians, under Miltiades, march to Marathon. They hold the
high ground; the Persians are on the plain. The Greeks charge—
Herodotus emphasizes the unprecedented run:

> "The Athenians, when the word was given, advanced at a run towards
> the barbarians; and the space between the armies was not less than
> eight stadia. The Persians, seeing them coming on at a run, prepared
> to receive them, thinking the Athenians mad..."  
> — Herodotus, *Histories*, VI.112

The Greek wings envelop the Persian center. Persian casualties are
high; the surviving force re-embarks. Athens holds. The expedition
fails.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. PERSIAN ENCODING — MINOR SETBACK
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
For Persia, Marathon is not catastrophic. The empire does not depend
on Athenian submission. The satrapies remain; the Royal Road functions;
Darius rules. The expedition is a punitive raid that failed—not a
strategic defeat.

Pierre Briant situates Marathon within Persian imperial logic:

> "The Greek victories were defensive—they did not threaten the Persian
> heartland. Marathon, Salamis, Plataea—from the Persian view these
> were frontier engagements."  
> — Pierre Briant, *From Cyrus to Alexander* (paraphrase of analytical point)

Xerxes will inherit the Greek question; Marathon does not resolve it.
The encoding divergence persists: Greece celebrates deliverance;
Persia absorbs a setback and continues.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Marathon encodes **perspective-dependent significance**:
• Greek: founding myth of Western resistance; birth of democracy's defense
• Persian: minor frontier event; one of many expeditions
• Structural: Persian imperial logic does not require Marathon's absorption;
  the empire endures; the Greek question remains open

The battle matters more to those who won it than to those who lost it.
