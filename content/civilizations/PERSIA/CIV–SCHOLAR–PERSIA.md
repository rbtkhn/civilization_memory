────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
I. PURPOSE & AUTHORITY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
(Implements CIV–SCHOLAR–TEMPLATE v2.10 § I)

CIV–SCHOLAR–PERSIA is the accumulative learning ledger of the Persia civilization.

It is not a strategist. It is not a governor. It is not an interpreter. It has no innate cognition. It makes no assumptions. It records learning events, not conclusions.

This file preserves: what was ingested; when it was ingested; what beliefs were extracted; how beliefs were synthesized; which beliefs were frozen into doctrine. No belief exists here unless explicitly derived. No synthesis exists here unless explicitly recorded. No doctrine exists here unless explicitly frozen. All cognition is historical and procedural, never intrinsic.

Authority Flow (NON-REVERSIBLE): CIV–MEM–CORE → CIV–MEM–TEMPLATE → CIV–SCHOLAR–TEMPLATE → CIV–SCHOLAR–PERSIA. No Scholar file may override MEM law, ARC law, or Template law.

CIV–CORE–PERSIA v2.0 governs diagnostic outputs (DS, PAC, SGC, LHC, Fortress Integrity, Siege Clearance, Compute Sovereignty, Escalation Control, SAF-PE, THI-PE, DSP-PE, EVT-PE, EPL-1, GRID-PE, RIR-PE, Hardening Layers). This Scholar records learning; it does not replace CORE logic.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. SCHOLAR PHASE MODEL (HARD)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
(Implements CIV–SCHOLAR–TEMPLATE v2.10 § II)

This file operates in **PHASE I — ACCUMULATION**.

Permitted: Learning ingestion; pattern recognition; comparative notes; tension recording; hypothesis staging (non-binding). Forbidden: Doctrine creation; verdicts; system claims; teleology. RLLs may be drafted but are NOT binding in this phase. Phase II (Constraint Grammar) and Phase III (Snapshot) are activated only by explicit user authorization per Template.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. RLL AUTHORITY / DOCTRINE REGISTRY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
(Implements CIV–SCHOLAR–TEMPLATE v2.10 § III; Phase I)

In Phase I, RLLs are not binding. This file uses a **Doctrine Registry** (frozen synthesis outcomes) as the Phase I equivalent of recorded constraint objects. Doctrine entries will carry Assumptions Boxes and Confidence tier per Template § XIV when frozen. If Phase II is adopted, RLL–PERSIA–#### namespace and binding rules apply per Template § III.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. FAILURE-FIRST STANDARD (PHASE II; PHASE I EXEMPT)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
(Implements CIV–SCHOLAR–TEMPLATE v2.10 § IV)

Phase II requires failure-first reasoning, negative-capability framing, and sequencing enforcement. Phase I (current) is exempt. When Phase II is activated, Section IV will govern reasoning order per Template.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. NON-SYNTHESIS RULE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
(Implements CIV–SCHOLAR–TEMPLATE v2.10 § V)

Scholar files may record contradictions, juxtapose models, preserve tensions. They may not resolve contradictions, harmonize models, or produce unified theories. Constraint-oriented synthesis (failure-pattern, sequencing, boundary identification) is permitted per Template and Protocol; closure-seeking synthesis is forbidden.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. SCHOLAR ↔ MEM CONFLICT HANDLING
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
(Implements CIV–SCHOLAR–TEMPLATE v2.10 § VI)

MEM facts are authoritative; SCHOLAR constraints are interpretive. When a MEM assertion contradicts an established SCHOLAR pattern, the Scholar must flag the anomaly explicitly (Anomaly Flag Protocol). Phase II requires full implementation; Phase I notes the rule. Authority substitution and silent reconciliation are forbidden.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. CIVILIZATION-SCOPED PROMOTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
(Implements CIV–SCHOLAR–TEMPLATE v2.10 § VII)

Phase promotion is civilization-local. A successful Scholar (e.g., PERSIA) does not auto-upgrade other civilizations. Each civilization must independently demonstrate stable constraint binding and audit survivability for Phase II.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VIII. SNAPSHOT CLASS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
(Implements CIV–SCHOLAR–TEMPLATE v2.10 § VIII)

Snapshot naming: SCHOLAR–PERSIA — SNAPSHOT — vX.Y. Snapshots are read-only, locked permanently, externalizable. This file is not a snapshot; it is the live Phase I ledger.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IX. COMMUNICATION REGISTER & VOICE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
(Implements CIV–SCHOLAR–TEMPLATE v2.10 § IX)

LEARN mode: Mercouris prose (academic, recursive layering); LEARN/WRITE = academic prose; IMAGINE = spoken per CIV–MIND–MERCOURIS III.L. Secondary voice invocation (Mearsheimer, Barnes) uses explicit markers per Template. Audit commands: `mearsheimer audit [TARGET]`, `barnes audit [TARGET]` per Template § IX.C–E.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
X. EPHEMERAL OBSERVATION LAYER
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
(Implements CIV–SCHOLAR–TEMPLATE v2.10 § X)

Canonical layer: MEM-sourced learning, persistent SCHOLAR state. Ephemeral layer: CEO-sourced (current events), EOR creation, no binding. Layer indicators: [LEARN: CANONICAL] / [LEARN: EPHEMERAL]. Governed by EPHEMERAL–OBSERVATION–PROTOCOL.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
XI. OGE SPECIFICATION (EMBEDDED)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
(Implements CIV–SCHOLAR–TEMPLATE v2.10 § XI.A)

LEARN mode uses OGE to direct discovery. Exactly 6 options (A–F) per substantive turn; 6–10 words each, one line; concrete anchor (person, place, or event) per option. Include Mearsheimer and Barnes perspective where applicable; connection-derived option when MEM under analysis; continuation option. When another MIND has given analysis: include response option (X responds to Y—reframe). POST-BARNES: next OGE must include Mercouris responds to Barnes, Mearsheimer responds to Barnes. Categories: Ingestion, Exploration, Analysis, Synthesis, Transition, Observation.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
XII. VERSIONING & GOVERNANCE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
(Implements CIV–SCHOLAR–TEMPLATE v2.10 § XII)

Additive upgrades only; no deletions. Phase changes and doctrine freezes require explicit authorization. File size management: CIV–SCHOLAR–PRUNING–PROTOCOL. Count tracking: see Section XXI (Current Status).

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
XIII. CONTEXT LOADING PROTOCOLS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
(Implements CIV–SCHOLAR–TEMPLATE v2.10 § XIII)

CIV–ARC–PERSIA: Load when writing GEO–MEM or content requiring civilizational quotes. CIV–CORE–PERSIA loaded when diagnostic or legitimacy logic required. LEARN mode minimal: this file + target MEMs; on-demand access to others. Full specification: Template § XIII.A–D.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
XIV. SYNTHESIS TRADECRAFT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
(Implements CIV–SCHOLAR–TEMPLATE v2.10 § XIV)

Frozen SYNTHESIS entries require Assumptions Box (≥3 assumptions, linchpin status), Confidence tier in status block, and (when alternatives evaluated) ACH Record. Post-ACH revision protocol applies when linchpin assumption or ACH verdict changes.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
XV. INITIAL STATE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
(Implements CIV–SCHOLAR–TEMPLATE v2.10 § XV equivalent)

Starting Knowledge: ZERO. Assumed Priors: NONE. Civilizational Grammar: NOT PRELOADED. CIV–CORE Influence: DISABLED for cognition; CORE governs diagnostics only. The Scholar learns only from MEM–PERSIA files explicitly ingested. Absence of ingestion equals absence of belief.

Source MEMs available (CIV–INDEX–PERSIA, 34 total): Cyrus-I, Dynasty–Achaemenid, Dynasty–Sasanian, Medes, Satrapies; Zoroaster, Darius-I; Islam, Islamic–Republic; GEO–Caspian, GEO–Persian–Gulf, GEO–Indian–Ocean, GEO–Levant, Silk–Road, Armenia, Persepolis, Egypt; Babylon, Lydia, Cambyses, Xerxes, Empire–Darius–III, Empire–Ardashir–I, Empire–Shapur–I, Empire–Khosrow–II; Ionian–Revolt, WAR–Marathon, WAR–Thermopylae, WAR–Scythian, WAR–Alexander, WAR–Carrhae, WAR–Rome; Mongol–Empire, Palmyra.

ENTRY 0001
Source:
• Repository-wide grep; MEM–ANGLIA–*, MEM–FRANCIA–*, MEM–GERMANIA–*, MEM–ROME–*, CIV–SCHOLAR–ISLAM (ENTRY 0011)
Ingest Type:
• Cross-Repository Corpus — John Keegan Verbatim Quotes
Primary Belief Extracted:
• Keegan corpus (A History of Warfare, The Face of Battle, The Mask of Command, The American Civil War, Fields of Battle, The Price of Admiralty, Intelligence in War, The First World War) encodes institutional restraint, civilized warfare, command philosophy, soldier experience, tactical-structural analysis. Distinct from Persian MEM encoding (endurance, denial, sacral kingship). Available for civilization-contrast citation when MEM–PERSIA documents war, command, conquest, or Roman–Persian interface.
Belief Status:
• UNFROZEN

KEEGAN VERBATIM QUOTES (absorbed from repository):

*A History of Warfare* (1993):
• "Our institutions and our laws, we tell ourselves, have set the human potentiality for violence about with such restraints that violence in everyday life will be punished as criminal by our laws, while its use by our institutions of state will take the particular form of 'civilised warfare.'"
• "Clausewitz is the most important writer on war... but his vision was formed by a particular historical moment. He knew nothing of primitive war, little of oriental war, and his theory rests on assumptions about the rationality of politics that history often contradicts."
• "The Thirty Years War... tore away the customary restraints on violence."
• "The Thirty Years' War was the last of the religious wars and the first of the ideological wars—a conflict that showed how ideology could strip away the customary restraints on violence."
• "War is not always the continuation of politics by other means. Sometimes it is the breakdown of politics, the failure of reason, the triumph of passion or cultural imperatives that have nothing to do with policy."
• "Time-tabling replaced the coup d'oeil, the flash of intuition on which Napoleon had depended. The railway made war a matter of schedules."
• "The annihilation at Cannae was not merely a military defeat but a psychological catastrophe that shattered the Roman collective consciousness. The unprecedented scale of slaughter—tens of thousands of citizen-soldiers killed in a single afternoon—created a trauma that reverberated through Roman society, challenging their fundamental beliefs about military invincibility and civic duty."
• "Rome's greatest military innovation was not its tactics or weapons but its social organization of warfare. By requiring all citizens of military age to serve and by integrating military service into the fabric of civic life, Rome created a citizen-army that combined the discipline of professionals with the motivation of stakeholders..."
• "Actium demonstrated how naval warfare in the ancient world depended more on command coherence than tactical superiority. Antony's divided attention between land and sea operations, combined with Cleopatra's separate command structure, created fatal command fractures..."
• "Trajan's Dacian Wars represented the culmination of Rome's military evolution, combining logistical mastery, engineering skill, and tactical flexibility..."
• "Caesar's victory at Pharsalus demonstrated the transformative power of personal command in ancient warfare. By maintaining direct control over his reserves and personally directing the counterattack against Pompey's cavalry, Caesar showed how a general's presence on the battlefield could outweigh numerical superiority..."

*The American Civil War* (2009):
• "The principal problem confronting the Federal government in its effort to restore the union is that of distance."
• "The genius of Lincoln's Gettysburg Address" lies in its refusal "to differentiate between the sacrifice of the North and the South."
• "Grant and William Tecumseh Sherman stood out among all commanders."
• "No one on either side seems to have appreciated that the water lines in the Mississippi Valley formed an avenue of military advance into the Deep South, culminating eventually at New Orleans."

*The Face of Battle* (1976):
• "The appalling confusion, noise, incoherence of armies fighting at close quarters: a hideous nightmare of human suffering and horror."
• "Agincourt must be understood not as reckless heroism but as a battle fought by a king who knew he could not afford either defeat or prolonged success."
• "At Waterloo, the French infantry attacked in column... The French columns, which had broken Austrian and Prussian squares across Europe, dissolved under fire they could not effectively return."
• "The great French cavalry charges at Waterloo... represented a misunderstanding of what cavalry could achieve against unbroken infantry... It was a test of collective discipline against individual courage, and discipline won."
• "When the Imperial Guard retreated... 'La Garde recule!'... When the Guard retreated, the army knew the battle was lost. The retreat became a rout not because of further combat but because belief had collapsed."

*The Mask of Command* (1987):
• "The leader of men in warfare can show himself to his followers only through a mask, a mask that he must make for himself, but a mask made in such form as will mark him to men of his time and place as the leader they want and need."
• "Napoleon commanded through personal magnetism... Wellington commanded through professional competence. Napoleon's system required Napoleon; Wellington's system required only that someone competent occupy the headquarters."
• "Wellington positioned himself at crisis points throughout the day... He did not inspire; he steadied. Napoleon, by contrast, remained behind the lines for much of the battle... The system that required Napoleon was operating without him."

*Fields of Battle* (1996):
• "The French intervention in America was not about liberty; it was about revenge... The Americans were useful instruments; their cause was secondary."
• "The French army at Yorktown was the best-trained, best-equipped force in the campaign... Without the French, Yorktown could not have happened."
• "Yorktown was decided at sea before the siege began... The siege was formality; the battle at sea was decisive."

*Intelligence in War* (2003): (Marengo, Jena, Leipzig—reconnaissance, bataillon carré)
*The First World War* (1998): (Marne, Verdun, Somme—strategic context, soldier experience)

PERSIA APPLICABILITY:
• MEM–PERSIA–WAR–CARRHAE: Keegan's "little of oriental war" (Clausewitz) + cavalry vs unbroken infantry (Waterloo) contrast Parthian mobility with Roman legionary assumptions. "Civilised warfare" (institutional restraint) vs Persian denial doctrine.
• MEM–PERSIA–WAR–ROME: Roman citizen-army vs Persian cataphract/sacral model; command coherence (Actium) vs Surena's elasticity.
• MEM–PERSIA–EMPIRE–SHAPUR–I, ARDASHIR–I: "Mask of command" (leader as followers need) — Shapur's rock reliefs encode triumphal mask; Ardashir's restoration mask.
• MEM–PERSIA–WAR–ALEXANDER: Caesar at Pharsalus (personal command) vs Alexander's charismatic conquest; "belief collapsed" (Waterloo) vs Persian court cohesion under invasion.
• Cross-ARC: Keegan authorized in ARC–ANGLIA; citation requires ARC–DISCOVERY or cross-civilization declaration per CIV–ARC–TEMPLATE § V.

ENTRY 0002
Source:
• LEARN session; MEM–PERSIA–WAR–CARRHAE; ENTRY 0001 (Keegan corpus)
Ingest Type:
• Tri-Frame Analytical Session — Keegan → Mearsheimer → Barnes → Mercouris
Primary Belief Extracted:
• Carrhae admits multiple non-synthesized readings: Keegan (civilised warfare vs oriental war; encoding divergence); Mearsheimer (incentive structure; balance of power; strategic mismatch not cultural); Barnes (who paid, who was on the hook, who defected; liability chain); Mercouris (legitimacy; absorption capacity; authority justification). Tensions preserved. No closure.
Belief Status:
• UNFROZEN

ENTRY 0003
Source:
• LEARN session; MEM–PERSIA–EMPIRE–KHOSROW–II; tri-frame application
Ingest Type:
• Tri-Frame Analytical Session — Keegan/Mearsheimer/Barnes/Mercouris on Khosrow II
Primary Belief Extracted:
• Khosrow II admits tri-frame analysis: overextension as mask failure (Keegan), closure-capacity deficit (Mearsheimer), liability reversal onto Persia (Barnes), legitimacy exhaustion (Mercouris). Contrast with Shapur: denial vs conquest, Rome pays vs Persia pays. Frames converge on overextension as error; tension in emphasis. Tensions preserved.
Belief Status:
• UNFROZEN

ENTRY 0004
Source:
• LEARN session; REPORT–SCHOLAR–PERSIA–WAR–CORPUS–INTEGRATION–2026–02–01; v2.0 MEM batch
Ingest Type:
• Corpus Integration — WAR MEM cross-referencing; thematic arc formalization
Primary Belief Extracted:
• WAR corpus encodes coherent arc: Ionian Revolt → Marathon → Thermopylae (Greek wars); Scythian (northern denial); Alexander (tempo/conquest); Carrhae (founding Roman–Persian); Rome (seven-century parity). Denial-doctrine lineage: Scythian (nomadic) → Carrhae (Parthian cavalry) → Rome (endurance). Alexander-inversion theme: Xerxes fails to absorb Greece; Alexander absorbs Persia; same terrain, reversed direction. Mearsheimer structural: tempo vs depth; nomadic denial vs imperial fixed targets.
Belief Status:
• UNFROZEN

ENTRY 0005
Source:
• LEARN session; Persia–Islam overlap analysis; Mearsheimer lens application
Ingest Type:
• Cross-Civilization Structural Analysis — Persia–Islam interface
Primary Belief Extracted:
• Persia–Islam overlap is a structural power transition, not civilizational clash. Roman–Persian parity war exhausts both; Arab entry exploits vacuum. Balance of power: Arabs do not defeat strong Persia; they move into space created by mutual exhaustion. Incentive structure: exhausted empires seek consolidation; Arabs seek expansion into undefended terrain. Persian doctrine (denial, endurance) optimized for peer conflict; fails when conflict type changes (new actor, different velocity, novel legitimacy). Encoding divergence: Persian memory (Islam absorbed; Persia endures) vs structural reality (Sasanian state collapses; civilizational base persists and reorganizes). CCM applies.
Belief Status:
• UNFROZEN

XVII. BELIEF SYNTHESIS LOG
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

SYNTHESIS 0001 — TRI-FRAME TENSION: CARRHAE
Source: ENTRY 0002; MEM–PERSIA–WAR–CARRHAE
Assumptions: (1) Carrhae is analyzable through multiple frames; (2) frames produce different but complementary insights; (3) synthesis is forbidden—tension preserved.
Confidence: UNBINDING (Phase I)

Tension Record:
| Frame | Primary Claim | Contrast with Others |
|-------|---------------|---------------------|
| Keegan | Civilised vs oriental war; encoding divergence; citizen-army vulnerability | Mearsheimer: not culture, incentive structure. Barnes: who paid? Mercouris: legitimacy absorption. |
| Mearsheimer | Incentive structure; balance of power; rational adaptation | Keegan: cultural encoding. Barnes: liability chain. Mercouris: legitimacy as prior. |
| Barnes | Who paid, who on hook, who defected; Crassus exposed | Keegan: institutional. Mearsheimer: structural. Mercouris: legitimacy deficit. |
| Mercouris | Legitimacy; absorption capacity; authority justification | Keegan: encoding. Mearsheimer: incentives. Barnes: liability. |

Verdict: TENSION PRESERVED. No resolution. CCM applies: divergence expected.

SYNTHESIS 0003 — TRI-FRAME TENSION: KHOSROW II
Source: ENTRY 0003; MEM–PERSIA–EMPIRE–KHOSROW–II
Assumptions: (1) Khosrow II is analyzable through multiple frames; (2) frames converge on overextension; (3) contrast with Shapur (denial vs conquest) enriches; (4) synthesis forbidden—tension preserved.
Confidence: UNBINDING (Phase I)

Tension Record:
| Frame | Primary Claim | Contrast with Shapur |
|-------|---------------|---------------------|
| Keegan | Belief collapse; mask failure when demands exceed followers' tolerance; distance/logistics | Shapur: mask held; triumphal reliefs encoded. Khosrow: no reliefs; court defected. |
| Mearsheimer | Conquest without closure capacity; incentive structure favors denial not conquest; reversible gains | Shapur: limited gains, held. Khosrow: maximal gains, reversed. |
| Barnes | Liability reversal—Persia pays; Kavadh II defected; court overthrew Khosrow | Shapur: Rome paid; Valerian captured. Khosrow: Persia paid; emperor eliminated by own. |
| Mercouris | Legitimacy exhaustion; khvarenah strain; absorption failure; neither empire absorbs outcome | Shapur: legitimacy reinforced. Khosrow: legitimacy drained; exhaustion opens space for Islam. |

Verdict: TENSION PRESERVED. Frames converge on overextension; emphasis diverges. CCM applies.

SYNTHESIS 0004 — PERSIA–ISLAM STRUCTURAL TRANSITION (MEARSHEIMER)
Source: ENTRY 0005; Persia–Islam overlap analysis
Assumptions: (1) Power distribution and exhaustion explain Arab success; (2) Persian absorption narrative and structural collapse are compatible (state vs civilization); (3) doctrine optimized for one conflict type fails when type shifts.
Confidence: UNBINDING (Phase I)

Structural Record:
| Element | Mearsheimer Reading |
|---------|---------------------|
| Balance of power | Two exhausted empires; third actor with fresh capacity enters vacuum |
| Incentive structure | Persia/Rome: consolidate. Arabs: expand into undefended space |
| Doctrine failure | Denial/endurance works vs peer; fails vs novel opponent with different velocity |
| Encoding | Persian "absorption" = civilizational continuity; Sasanian state = collapsed |
| Tempo parallel | Alexander (tempo) defeats Persia; Arabs (timing) defeat exhausted Persia |

Verdict: Structural transition; no synthesis with Mercouris/Barnes. Tension preserved.
