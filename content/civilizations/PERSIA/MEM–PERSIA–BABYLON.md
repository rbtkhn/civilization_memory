I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves **Cyrus's conquest of Babylon** (539 BC) from
Persia's perspective: the capture of the Neo-Babylonian capital that
brought Mesopotamia into the Achaemenid empire and established the
liberation narrative as imperial propaganda. The Cyrus Cylinder and
Hebrew sources (Isaiah, Ezra) present Cyrus as restorer of order and
cult; Herodotus and the Nabonidus Chronicle offer alternate angles.
The conquest encodes **integrative legitimacy**—the Persian ethic of
presenting conquest as liberation.

Lloyd Llewellyn-Jones frames the propaganda success:

> "Cyrus played very carefully to different audiences... It was built
> on this idea of liberation, even though it really wasn't. I always
> think of George Bush... 'Operation Iraqi Freedom'. I think we can
> call Cyrus's Babylon campaign 'Operation Babylonian Freedom'."  
> — Lloyd Llewellyn-Jones, FiveBooks interview (2020), on *Persians: The Age of the Great Kings*

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

II. THE CONQUEST — HERODOTUS AND NABONIDUS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Herodotus records Cyrus's stratagem:

> "When the Babylonians had withdrawn behind their walls, Cyrus led the
> river by a channel into the basin, which was then a marsh, making the
> stream sink until the old channel could be forded. When this happened,
> the Persian army that had been posted for this purpose entered Babylon
> by the bed of the Euphrates, which had now sunk to about the middle of
> a man's thigh."  
> — Herodotus, *Histories*, I.190

The city fell with minimal resistance. The Nabonidus Chronicle offers a
terse account; interpretation varies. What is clear: Babylon is
incorporated, not destroyed. Cyrus presents himself as legitimate
successor to the Babylonian kings.

III. THE CYRUS CYLINDER — LIBERATION PROPAGANDA
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Cyrus Cylinder declares Cyrus's restoration of cults, return of
deported peoples, and establishment of just rule. It addresses
Babylonian audiences—and later, Jewish and Western readers—as a
charter of tolerant kingship. The Cylinder encodes the **liberation
narrative** that Persia will deploy across the empire: we restore
order; we protect your gods; we govern through recognition.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. INTEGRATIVE LEGITIMACY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Cyrus assumes the Babylonian royal titulary. He presents himself as
chosen by Marduk. Local elites are co-opted. The administrative
structure persists. Conquest is followed by **incorporation**, not
annihilation—the same pattern as Lydia (Croesus spared) and later
satrapies.
