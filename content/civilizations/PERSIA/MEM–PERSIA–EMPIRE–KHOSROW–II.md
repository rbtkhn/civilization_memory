I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves **Khosrow II** as the Sasanian King of Kings who
achieved Persia's greatest territorial expansion against Rome—and
then lost everything. His reign (590–628 AD) encompasses the final
Roman–Persian war: triumph over Syria, Palestine, and Egypt; reversal
by Heraclius; and collapse that left both empires exhausted before
the Arab conquests.

Khosrow encodes the **terminal paradox** of Persian endurance doctrine:
overextension after success is lethal.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. RESTORATION — MAURICE AND THE THRONE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Khosrow II owes his throne to Roman Emperor Maurice, who restored him
in 591 after he was deposed by Bahram Chobin.

Edward Gibbon records the singular Roman–Persian alignment:

> "Maurice restored Khosrow to the throne of Persia, and in return
> received provinces which the Romans had not possessed since the
> reign of Jovian; and the two empires maintained, during the rest
> of their reigns, a peace which resembled the amity of the early
> emperors, when the Parthians acknowledged Roman supremacy."  
> — Edward Gibbon, *Decline and Fall*, Chapter XLVI

This peace is the best in centuries—and Khosrow will shatter it.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. THE INVASION — PERSIAN TRIUMPH (602–622)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
When Phocas murders Maurice (602), Khosrow invades—nominally to
avenge his benefactor, but the campaign becomes full conquest.

Persian armies occupy:
• Syria
• Palestine (Jerusalem; True Cross captured 614)
• Egypt

This is Persia's greatest western expansion. Ctesiphon has never
held more Roman territory.

Adrian Goldsworthy assesses the scale:

> "Khosrow's armies had achieved what no Persian force had done
> since the Achaemenids: they had conquered the Levant and Egypt,
> the economic heart of the Roman East. For a moment, it seemed
> that the Roman Empire might not survive."  
> — Adrian Goldsworthy, *Rome and Persia*

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. HERACLIUS — REVERSAL
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Heraclius (610) abandons static defense and carries the war into
Persia itself. By 627–628, Roman forces strike deep into Mesopotamia.
Khosrow is overthrown by his own court; his son Kavadh II sues for peace.
The conquered territories are returned. The True Cross is restored
to Jerusalem.

Gibbon records the strategic reversal:

> "Heraclius resolved to carry the war into the heart of Persia, and
> by a bold enterprise to compel the enemy to recall their armies
> from the conquest of the Roman provinces."  
> — Edward Gibbon, *Decline and Fall*, Chapter XLVI

Persian overextension meets Roman desperation—and reverses.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. EXHAUSTION — MUTUAL COLLAPSE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The war (602–628) exhausts both empires. Neither can hold what it
gained. Peter Sarris analyzes the economic consequence:

> "Heraclius' Persian campaigns, while militarily successful,
> accelerated the economic contraction of the Byzantine Empire. The
> prolonged warfare depleted remaining resources, disrupted trade
> networks, and created fiscal pressures that made subsequent
> defense against Arab conquests extraordinarily difficult."  
> — Peter Sarris, *Empires of Faith*

The same logic applies to Persia. Khosrow's expansion consumed
legitimacy and manpower; the Sasanian state never recovers.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. CIVILIZATIONAL LESSON — OVEREXTENSION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Khosrow violates the endurance doctrine that Carrhae and Shapur
validated. Denial and parity preserve sovereignty; conquest of
Roman heartlands invited total war—and Heraclius delivered it.

Touraj Daryaee situates the collapse:

> "The Sasanian Empire under Khosrow II had overreached. The
> occupation of Roman territory required resources the empire could
> not sustain, and when Heraclius counterattacked, the Persian
> heartland was exposed."  
> — Touraj Daryaee, *Sasanian Persia*

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. ISLAMIC AFTERMATH
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Within a decade of Khosrow's fall, Arab armies overrun both empires.
Anthony Kaldellis frames the structural outcome:

> "The Roman–Persian war had emptied both empires. When the Arab
> armies emerged from the peninsula, neither Constantinople nor
> Ctesiphon could muster the resources to resist."  
> — Anthony Kaldellis, *The New Roman Empire*

Khosrow's war did not cause the Islamic conquests—but it created
the conditions. Exhaustion is more dangerous than defeat.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VIII. MEARSHEIMER ASSESSMENT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Khosrow converted defensive parity into offensive overextension.
The occupation of Syria, Palestine, and Egypt stretched Persian
logistics and legitimacy. Heraclius's deep strike exploited the
concentration of Persian force at the front; the heartland was
undefended. Structural logic: conquest without closure capacity
creates reversible gains. Persia won battles and lost the war.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IX. BARNES ASSESSMENT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Who paid for Khosrow's expansion? Persian peasants, Armenian
auxiliaries, and eventually the Sasanian court itself—overthrown
by elites who refused further war. Who defected? Kavadh II, who
made peace to survive. The liability chain ran from conquest to
collapse; the emperor who overreached was eliminated by his own.
