I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves **Shapur I** as the Sasanian King of Kings who
achieved the **ultimate Persian triumph over Rome**: the capture of
Emperor Valerian at Edessa (260 AD), commemorated in stone at Naqsh-e
Rostam and encoded as civilizational validation for centuries.

Shapur is not merely a successful general.
He is the **apotheosis of Persian denial**—the ruler who proved that
Rome could be humiliated, not just resisted.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. SASANID RESURGENCE — RENEWED PERSIA
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Shapur inherits a Persia restored by his father Ardashir I, who
overthrew the Arsacid Parthians (224 AD).

The Sasanian project:
• Centralized royal authority
• Zoroastrian ideological cohesion
• Claims to Achaemenid restoration
• Aggressive western expansion

Shapur has already defeated Gordian III (244) and forced humiliating
peace on Philip the Arab before confronting Valerian.

Adrian Goldsworthy frames the transformation:

> "The Sassanids were not the Parthians. Where the Arsacids had been
> content to raid and negotiate, Shapur sought conquest and permanent
> humiliation of Rome. He wanted not just victory but the destruction
> of Roman pretensions to universal empire."  
> — Adrian Goldsworthy, *Rome and Persia*

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. THE CAPTURE — VALERIAN AT EDESSA (260 AD)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Shapur's own inscription at Naqsh-e Rostam (Res Gestae Divi Saporis)
records the triumph:

> "And the third time, when we attacked Carrhae and Edessa, the Caesar
> Valerian came against us, and with him was a force of seventy
> thousand... and we fought a great battle against them, and we took
> the Caesar Valerian with our own hands, and the commanders who were
> with him, and the praetorian prefect, and senators."  
> — Res Gestae Divi Saporis, Naqsh-e Rostam

The precision—"with our own hands"—is propaganda, but the capture is
historical fact. No Roman emperor had ever been taken alive by a
foreign enemy.

Edward Gibbon records the civilizational shock:

> "The pride of Rome was humbled to the dust; and the victorious
> monarch of Persia received the submission of a Roman emperor with
> the same haughty indifference with which he would have accepted
> the homage of the meanest of his subjects."  
> — Edward Gibbon, *The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire*, Vol. I, ch. 10

IV. PROPAGANDA IN STONE — PERMANENT MEMORY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Shapur commemorates his victories in rock reliefs at Naqsh-e Rostam and Bishapur.

Images depict:
• Shapur on horseback
• Valerian kneeling in submission
• Philip the Arab supplicating
• Gordian III trampled underfoot

These reliefs survive. They were visible for centuries. They encoded
Persian triumph in permanent form.

For Rome, there was no equivalent response. Valerian was never
ransomed, never recovered. His fate remained an open wound.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. LEGITIMACY AND KHVARENAH
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Sasanian kingship fused Zoroastrian cosmology with political authority.
The capture of a Roman emperor validated divine favor (khvarenah).

Pierre Briant situates Shapur within Persian imperial tradition:

> "The Sasanian kings presented themselves as restorers of the
> Achaemenid legacy, and Shapur's victories over Rome were framed
> as the renewal of Persian sovereignty against Western pretension."  
> — Pierre Briant, *From Cyrus to Alexander*

Shapur's triumph is not merely military—it is **cosmological validation**.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. STRUCTURAL CONSEQUENCES
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Valerian's capture accelerates Roman fragmentation:
• Eastern provinces undefended
• Palmyra fills power vacuum
• Gallic Empire secedes

Goldsworthy frames the lesson:

> "Valerian's capture proved that Roman emperors were not invincible,
> that Roman armies could be destroyed, and that Rome's eastern rival
> could humiliate the empire in ways no barbarian tribe ever could.
> For the Sassanids, it was validation; for Rome, it was trauma that
> shaped policy for generations."  
> — Adrian Goldsworthy, *Rome and Persia*

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. MEARSHEIMER ASSESSMENT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Shapur exploited Roman third-century crisis—frontier pressure, plague,
administrative fragmentation. The structural window for Persian
offensive action was narrow; Shapur seized it. Force ratio shifted
temporarily in Persia's favor; the capture was the logical outcome
of Roman overextension and Persian concentration.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VIII. BARNES ASSESSMENT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Valerian took the East personally because subordinates had failed.
Who was on the hook? The emperor. Who defected? Roman cohesion.
Shapur's propaganda made the liability permanent—stone outlasts
diplomacy. The "who pays?" answer: Roman legitimacy, for centuries.
