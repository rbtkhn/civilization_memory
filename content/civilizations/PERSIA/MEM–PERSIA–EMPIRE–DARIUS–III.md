I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves **Darius III** as the last Achaemenid King of
Kings: the ruler who faced Alexander at Issus (333 BC) and Gaugamela
(331 BC), whose flight from the battlefield became a symbol of
legitimacy collapse, and whose murder by his own satrap Bessus
(330 BC) ended the dynasty.

For Persia, Darius III represents **terminal failure**—not because
the empire was inherently weak, but because the king's authority
fractured under pressure. His story complements MEM–PERSIA–WAR–ALEXANDER:
Alexander conquers; Darius fails to hold.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. ACCESSION — SUCCESSION CHAOS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Darius III (Codomannus) accedes in 336 BC after the assassination of
Artaxerxes IV (Arses). He is a collateral member of the royal house,
placed on the throne by the chiliarch Bagoas, who then attempts to
poison him. Darius forces Bagoas to drink the poison himself. The
court is unstable; Alexander has already crossed the Hellespont.

Plutarch records the Macedonian view:

> "Alexander was not inferior to Darius in birth or courage, and had
> the advantage of youthful vigor and a spirit unimpaired by luxury...
> He was marching against a king who had been enfeebled by women and
> the eunuchs of his court."  
> — Plutarch, *Life of Alexander*, 18

The Greek sources encode Persian decadence; Persian sources are
absent. Darius enters the record through his enemies.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. ISSUS (333 BC) — THE FIRST COLLISION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
At Issus, Alexander defeats a larger Persian force. Darius's family—
mother, wife, daughters—fall into Macedonian hands. Darius flees.
Arrian records the Persian king's offer:

> "Darius sent a letter to Alexander... proposing that Alexander should
> take his daughter in marriage and receive all the territory west of
> the Euphrates as a dowry... and that they should be friends and
> allies."  
> — Arrian, *Anabasis of Alexander*, II.25

Alexander refuses. The war continues. Darius's flight at Issus becomes
pattern: the king abandons the field; the army loses cohesion.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. GAUGAMELA (331 BC) — DECISIVE DEFEAT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
At Gaugamela, Darius assembles the full imperial army—cavalry from
Bactria, Sogdiana, India; scythed chariots; massed infantry. The
terrain favors Persian numbers. Alexander attacks the center. Again,
Darius flees.

Arrian describes the moment:

> "As soon as Darius saw his left wing broken by Alexander... he fled
> with the first, just as he had done at Issus. And he was the first
> to flee, as long as daylight lasted."  
> — Arrian, *Anabasis of Alexander*, III.15

The Persian center collapses when the king departs. Keegan's Waterloo
insight applies: "When the Guard retreated, the army knew the battle
was lost. The retreat became a rout not because of further combat but
because belief had collapsed." Darius's flight is belief collapse.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. FLIGHT, BETRAYAL, DEATH
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Darius retreats to Ecbatana, then to Bactria. His satrap Bessus,
claiming royal legitimacy, arrests him. As Alexander approaches,
Bessus's men mortally wound Darius and leave him by the road.
Alexander finds the dying king; Darius names Alexander his successor
(so the sources claim) and dies.

Pierre Briant frames the structural failure:

> "Darius's repeated flights were not merely cowardice—they reflected
> a deeper crisis of Achaemenid legitimacy. The king's person was the
> locus of authority; when he fled, the army had no institutional
> center to hold. The satraps defected; Bessus's usurpation was the
> logical endpoint."  
> — Pierre Briant, *From Cyrus to Alexander*

In *Darius in the Shadow of Alexander*, Briant rehabilitates Darius's
strategic competence: he had dynastic legitimacy, prepared well for
confrontation, and "adhered to a coherent strategy—unfortunately
unsuccessful—in coping with an exceptional opponent." Strategic failure
does not imply strategic incompetence. Gaugamela shows the logic: Darius
chose terrain favoring cavalry and chariots, assembled the full imperial
army, and sought decisive battle on terms that exploited Persian numerical
advantage. The plan was rational. It failed because Alexander possessed
a **structural tempo advantage**—the ability to concentrate force faster,
strike the center, and force collapse before Persian depth could tell.
Power distribution, not character, explains the outcome. Darius's flight
was rational once the center broke; staying would have meant capture.
The Mearsheimer reading: coherent strategy met an opponent who could
exploit the structural vulnerabilities of king-centered legitimacy faster
than Persia could mobilize its material advantage.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. PERSIAN ENCODING — WHAT PERSIA REMEMBERS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Persia has no native narrative of Darius's defeat. The story survives
in Greek and Roman sources. Lloyd Llewellyn-Jones reminds us:

> "I've managed to write the Battle of Marathon in a sentence and a
> half, for instance. It was of very little consequence to the
> Persians."  
> — Lloyd Llewellyn-Jones, FiveBooks interview (2020), on *Persians: The Age of the Great Kings*

The inverse applies: Gaugamela and Darius's death were of enormous
consequence—but the Persian encoding is lost. We have Alexander's
story. Darius is the foil.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Darius III inherits a divided court and an incoming invasion.
• Briant: coherent strategy, exceptional opponent; failure ≠ incompetence.
• Structural tempo advantage (Alexander) vs material depth (Persia); power distribution, not character.
• His flights at Issus and Gaugamela trigger legitimacy collapse.
• Belief collapses when the king leaves the field; institutional continuity fails.
• Bessus's betrayal marks the fragmentation of Achaemenid loyalty.
• Persian encoding of the defeat is absent; Greek sources dominate.

Tension preserved without verdict.
