I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves **Ardashir I** as the founder of the Sasanian
dynasty: the ruler who overthrew the Arsacid Parthians (224 AD),
proclaimed Eranshahr ("realm of the Iranians"), and framed his
ascendancy not as revolution but as **restoration of rightful
Persian order**.

Ardashir is not a usurper.
He is the **compression point**—where Hellenistic and Parthian
dilution is reversed and Iranian kingship is recentralized.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. RISE — PERSIS TO ERANSHAHR
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Ardashir stems from a noble family in Persis (Fars). His grandfather
Sasan gives the dynasty its name; his father Papak is local ruler.
After Papak and brother Shapur die, Ardashir consolidates power in
Pars and initiates rebellion against Parthian suzerainty.

Pierre Briant situates the ideological claim:

> "The Sasanian kings presented themselves as restorers of the
> Achaemenid legacy, and their rise was framed as the renewal of
> Persian sovereignty against foreign dilution."  
> — Pierre Briant, *From Cyrus to Alexander*

Ardashir claims descent from mythical Iranian shahs and portrays
himself as worshipper of Ahura Mazda with divine royal glory (khvarenah).

Lloyd Llewellyn-Jones notes the political charge of pre-Islamic reception:

> "What the Iranians do with their pre-Islamic past is a hot potato.
> Therefore, within Iran itself, there is very little history being
> written by Iranian scholars. But the Iranian diaspora is producing
> scholars and I think that's important."  
> — Lloyd Llewellyn-Jones, FiveBooks interview (2020), on *Persians: The Age of the Great Kings*

Ardashir's restoration narrative thus operates in contested space—then and now.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. THE BATTLE OF HORMOZDGAN (224 AD)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
On the plain of Hormozdgan (April 28, 224), Ardashir defeats the
last Parthian King of Kings, Artabanus IV, killing him in battle.

The Arsacid dynasty ends. The Sasanian begins.

Touraj Daryaee frames the structural shift:

> "Ardashir's victory over Artabanus was not merely a dynastic
> coup but the establishment of a new imperial ideology. Where
> the Arsacids had governed through confederation and noble
> accommodation, the Sasanians demanded centralization and
> sacral authority."  
> — Touraj Daryaee, *Sasanian Persia*

Power hardens inward before projecting outward.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. RESTORATION IDEOLOGY — NOT REVOLUTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Ardashir deliberately presents himself as continuator of Achaemenid
tradition to legitimize rule and delegitimize Parthian authority.

Claims include:
• Descent from legendary Iranian kings
• Divine favor (khvarenah) in Zoroastrian cosmology
• Moral struggle against chaos (druj)
• Eranshahr as the restored Iranian realm

Rock reliefs at Firuzabad, Naqsh-e Rajab, and Naqsh-e Rustam depict
Ardashir and Ahura Mazda defeating Artabanus and Ahriman. Cosmic
order is restored; political authority is inseparable from
metaphysical legitimacy.

Edward Gibbon notes the ideological rupture:

> "The Persian monarchy, which had been subverted by Alexander,
> was restored by Ardashir; and the new dynasty, adopting the
> name and maxims of the ancient kings, pretended to revive the
> glory of Cyrus and Darius."  
> — Edward Gibbon, *Decline and Fall*, ch. 8

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. CONSOLIDATION — CENTRALIZATION OVER CONFEDERATION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Ardashir's early reign emphasizes:
• Suppression of semi-autonomous noble houses
• Reassertion of Iranian kingship traditions
• Clear rupture with Hellenistic pluralism
• Reintegration of frontier zones

Adrian Goldsworthy contrasts the regimes:

> "The Sassanids were not the Parthians. Where the Arsacids had
> been content to raid and negotiate, Shapur sought conquest and
> permanent humiliation of Rome."  
> — Adrian Goldsworthy, *Rome and Persia*

The father builds the machine; the son wields it. Ardashir creates
the centralized state that Shapur will project against Rome.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. FOUNDATIONAL LEGACY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Ardashir establishes:
• Shahanshah as title (King of Kings)
• Zoroastrian-aligned sacral kingship
• Administrative and military foundations for Sasanian durability
• The ideological template Shapur inherits

The Sasanian project—centralized, sacral, expansionist—begins here.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. MEARSHEIMER ASSESSMENT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Ardashir exploits Parthian fragmentation: weak central authority,
noble autonomy, Roman pressure. The structural window for rebellion
opens when Arsacid cohesion fails. Ardashir concentrates force in
Persis, defeats the nominal suzerain, and replaces confederation
with hierarchy. Power distribution shifts from dispersed to centralized.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VIII. BARNES ASSESSMENT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Who paid for Ardashir's rise? The Arsacid court and Parthian
nobles who lost autonomy. Who defected? Artabanus's vassals who
saw Sasanian momentum. The "restoration" narrative obscures
liability transfer: from Parthian legitimacy to Persian. Ardashir
captures the narrative before the battle is fully won.

PERSIA (same-civilization ≥10):
• MEM–PERSIA–DYNASTY–SASANIAN — Ardashir as founder
• MEM–PERSIA–EMPIRE–SHAPUR–I — son; inherits consolidated state
• MEM–PERSIA–DYNASTY–ACHAEMENID — restoration claims
• MEM–PERSIA–ZOROASTER — sacral kingship, khvarenah
• MEM–PERSIA–CYRUS–I — imperial continuity invoked
• MEM–PERSIA–WAR–ROME — Sasanian phase initiated
• MEM–PERSIA–WAR–CARRHAE — Parthian precedent (Ardashir replaces Parthians)
• MEM–PERSIA–ARMENIA — Arsacid dynastic ties severed
• MEM–PERSIA–EMPIRE–KHOSROW–II — terminal Sasanian (contrast)
• MEM–PERSIA–ISLAM — post-Sasanian absorption

Cross-civilization (≥3):
• MEM–ROME–EMPIRE–VALERIAN — Valerian faces Sasanian (not Parthian) Persia
• MEM–ROME–WAR–PERSIA — regime change alters conflict character
• MEM–ROME–EMPIRE–DIOCLETIAN — later Roman restorer (parallel to Ardashir's consolidation)

Breaks if removed: MEM–PERSIA–DYNASTY–SASANIAN (founder context); MEM–PERSIA–EMPIRE–SHAPUR–I (succession).
