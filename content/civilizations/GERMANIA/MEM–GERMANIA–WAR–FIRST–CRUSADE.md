I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves the First Crusade as **Germania's inaugural
participation in collective Christendom's defining enterprise**:
the expedition that captured Jerusalem and established Latin
states in the Levant under leadership that included Germanic
nobility at the highest level.

The First Crusade is not remembered as a German war.
It is remembered as **a Latin enterprise in which Germans
participated as partners rather than leaders**—a pattern that
would persist until Frederick Barbarossa's Third Crusade
a century later.

For Germania, the First Crusade matters because it demonstrated
that German military capacity could project beyond Europe, and
because the first ruler of Jerusalem—Godfrey of Bouillon—came
from the Empire's Lotharingian borderlands. The crusade also
initiated the pattern of German violence against Jews that
would recur in subsequent expeditions.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

II. STRATEGIC CONTEXT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The First Crusade emerged from papal initiative and imperial
ambivalence:

PAPAL CALL (NOVEMBER 1095):
Pope Urban II proclaimed the crusade at Clermont, summoning
Latin Christendom to recover Jerusalem from Muslim rule. The
appeal crossed linguistic and political boundaries.

IMPERIAL POSITION:
Emperor Henry IV was under papal excommunication during the
Investiture Contest. His conflict with the papacy prevented
official imperial participation; Germans joined individually
rather than as a coordinated imperial force.

> "The First Crusade was a papal project, and Henry IV was
> the pope's enemy. Germans crusaded not under imperial
> banner but despite imperial circumstances. They joined as
> Christians, not as subjects of the emperor."
> — Peter H. Wilson, *Heart of Europe* (2016), p. 142
> [ERC: SECONDARY]

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. GERMANIC CONTINGENTS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
German participation operated through regional leadership:

GODFREY OF BOUILLON:
Duke of Lower Lorraine, from the Empire's western borderlands.
Godfrey sold or mortgaged his territories to finance the
expedition, leading a substantial Lotharingian force. His
brothers Eustace and Baldwin accompanied him.

> "Godfrey was not a German in the modern sense, but he was
> an imperial vassal from the Empire's Lotharingian lands.
> His expedition represented the northwestern German lands
> projecting power toward Jerusalem."
> — Christopher Tyerman, *God's War* (2006), p. 112
> [ERC: SECONDARY]

OTHER GERMAN LORDS:
Count Emicho of Flonheim led a Rhineland contingent that
distinguished itself primarily through anti-Jewish violence.
Various Swabian, Bavarian, and Saxon nobles joined different
armies.

PEOPLE'S CRUSADE:
Peter the Hermit's popular crusade included German peasants
and minor nobility. This uncoordinated mass was largely
destroyed in Anatolia before reaching the Holy Land.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. RHINELAND MASSACRES (1096)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The First Crusade initiated Germanic anti-Jewish violence:

PATTERN:
Crusading contingents, particularly those under Emicho of
Flonheim, attacked Jewish communities in the Rhineland cities:
Speyer, Worms, Mainz, Cologne, and others. The violence was
justified as action against "enemies of Christ" closer than
Jerusalem.

EPISCOPAL RESPONSE:
Some bishops attempted protection; Bishop John of Speyer
sheltered Jews in his palace. Others failed or declined
to intervene.

> "The Rhineland massacres established a terrible precedent.
> Crusading zeal could be redirected from distant Muslims
> to proximate Jews. This pattern would recur in 1146, in
> the Black Death, and beyond—a Germanic inheritance from
> crusading origins."
> — Peter H. Wilson, *Heart of Europe* (2016), p. 145
> [ERC: SECONDARY]

MEMORY:
Jewish chronicles preserved detailed accounts. The massacres
became foundational memory in Ashkenazi Jewish history,
commemorated in liturgy and narrative.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. CAMPAIGN AND CONQUEST
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The military campaign achieved its objective:

MARCH THROUGH ANATOLIA (1097):
The crusading armies, including Godfrey's contingent, crossed
Byzantine territory and defeated the Seljuk Turks at Dorylaeum.
The march continued through Anatolia with significant attrition.

SIEGE OF ANTIOCH (1097–1098):
The prolonged siege tested crusader cohesion. Antioch fell
through treachery; the crusaders then withstood a Muslim
counter-siege.

SIEGE OF JERUSALEM (JUNE–JULY 1099):
The final objective was stormed on July 15, 1099. The
massacre of Muslim and Jewish inhabitants followed.

> "The capture of Jerusalem was a collective Latin achievement.
> No single nation owned the victory; French, Norman, German,
> Flemish, and Italian crusaders had all contributed. But the
> first ruler would come from imperial Lotharingia."
> — Christopher Tyerman, *God's War* (2006), p. 159
> [ERC: SECONDARY]

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. GODFREY AS RULER
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Germanic leadership of Jerusalem was brief but significant:

ADVOCATE OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE:
Godfrey declined the title "King," reportedly refusing to
wear a crown of gold where Christ had worn a crown of thorns.
He ruled as Advocatus Sancti Sepulchri (Advocate of the
Holy Sepulchre).

BRIEF REIGN (1099–1100):
Godfrey died in July 1100, barely a year after Jerusalem's
capture. His brother Baldwin succeeded as King Baldwin I,
establishing the dynasty.

> "Godfrey's refusal of the crown became legend—pious humility
> or political calculation, later generations could choose.
> Either way, a Lotharingian imperial vassal had established
> the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem."
> — Peter H. Wilson, *Heart of Europe* (2016), p. 148
> [ERC: SECONDARY]

BALDWIN'S SUCCESSION:
Baldwin I (r. 1100–1118) built the Latin Kingdom into a
viable state. The Lotharingian dynasty ruled until 1131,
when it passed to the French house of Anjou.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. INSTITUTIONAL CONSEQUENCES
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The First Crusade created enduring institutions:

LATIN STATES:
The Kingdom of Jerusalem, County of Tripoli, Principality
of Antioch, and County of Edessa created a Latin Christian
presence in the Levant lasting until 1291.

MILITARY ORDERS:
The Templars (1119) and Hospitallers (1113) emerged from
crusading needs. The Teutonic Order (1190) would later
follow this model for German crusading.

CRUSADING TRADITION:
The First Crusade established the precedent that subsequent
emperors would invoke. Frederick Barbarossa, Frederick II,
and others defined imperial legitimacy partly through
crusading commitment.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VIII. LONG-TERM CONSEQUENCES
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The First Crusade produced effects extending beyond 1099:

IMPERIAL-PAPAL DYNAMIC:
The crusade demonstrated papal capacity to mobilize
Christendom independently of imperial leadership. This
enhanced papal authority vis-à-vis the Empire.

GERMAN-JEWISH RELATIONS:
The Rhineland massacres established violence as a crusading
accompaniment. Subsequent crusade preaching triggered
subsequent anti-Jewish violence.

> "The First Crusade taught German Jews what crusading meant:
> not distant warfare but proximate danger. This lesson was
> not forgotten; it shaped Jewish settlement patterns, legal
> protections sought, and memory transmitted."
> — Christopher Tyerman, *God's War* (2006), p. 103
> [ERC: SECONDARY]

EASTERN ORIENTATION:
The crusade demonstrated that German military capacity could
operate far from home. This experience would inform later
eastern expansion—both toward Jerusalem and toward the
Baltic.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IX. DOCTRINAL IMPLICATIONS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The First Crusade instantiates the COLLECTIVE ENTERPRISE pattern:

PATTERN: Germanic participation in Latin Christendom's
defining enterprise operates through regional lords rather
than imperial coordination. Lotharingian leadership of
Jerusalem demonstrates Germanic capacity for distant state-
building, but papal initiative controls the enterprise.

APPLICABLE DOCTRINES:
• DOCTRINE 05: Ecclesiastical-Political Tension — Papal
  crusade call during imperial excommunication demonstrates
  dual authority structure
• DOCTRINE 07: Encirclement Anxiety and Countermeasure —
  Not applicable; crusade is projection, not defense

RLL CONNECTION:
• RLL–GERMANIA–0007 (Anti-Jewish Violence as Crusading
  Accompaniment): The Rhineland massacres established the
  pattern that crusade preaching triggered anti-Jewish
  violence in German lands
