I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves Aachen Cathedral as **Germania's sacral foundation
stone**: the building where Charlemagne established his capital,
where thirty-one German kings were crowned over six centuries, and
where the claim to Roman-Christian imperial authority was physically
embodied in architecture.

For Germania, Aachen Cathedral represents **origin made permanent**.
Unlike Cologne (which took 632 years to build) or later imperial
churches, the Palatine Chapel was completed within a single reign
and has stood continuously since Charlemagne's death. It is the
oldest cathedral in Northern Europe still in use.

Peter H. Wilson captures the foundational significance:

> "Aachen was where German kingship began its claim to Roman imperial
> succession. The chapel Charlemagne built, the throne he sat upon,
> the tomb that held his bones—these became the physical credentials
> of legitimate rule."
> — Peter H. Wilson, *Heart of Europe* (2016)
> [ERC: SECONDARY]

UNESCO designated Aachen Cathedral as Germany's first World Heritage
Site (1978), recognizing its "exceptional universal value" as the
prototype of religious architecture for the Carolingian Renaissance.

This file records the cathedral as **legitimacy crystallized in stone**:
demonstrating how a single building can transmit authority across
centuries by housing the relics of founding power.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

II. CHARLEMAGNE'S CONSTRUCTION (796–805)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Charlemagne builds his palace chapel to claim Roman inheritance.

After decades of itinerant kingship, Charlemagne settled at Aachen
(c. 794), attracted by the hot springs and central location. The
palace complex required a chapel worthy of imperial ambition.

Einhard, Charlemagne's biographer, describes the construction:

> "He built at Aachen a most beautiful basilica, which he adorned
> with gold and silver, and with railings and doors of solid brass.
> He had columns and marbles brought from Rome and Ravenna, for
> he could not find them elsewhere."
> — Einhard, *Vita Karoli Magni* (c. 830)
> [ERC: PRIMARY]

The design deliberately echoed San Vitale in Ravenna—the Byzantine
imperial church. By claiming its architectural language, Charlemagne
claimed its imperial authority.

Construction was directed by Odo of Metz. The core structure—the
octagonal Palatine Chapel—was completed by 805, though decoration
continued afterward.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. ARCHITECTURAL SIGNIFICANCE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Palatine Chapel introduces a new architectural grammar.

**The Octagon**:
The central structure is an octagon surrounded by a sixteen-sided
ambulatory, rising to a dome 31 meters high. The eight-sided form
symbolized resurrection (the "eighth day" of creation) and imperial
authority (Byzantine precedent).

**The Materials**:
• Columns and capitals: Spoliated from Rome and Ravenna
• Bronze doors: Cast in Aachen (still extant)
• Bronze railings: Carolingian originals
• Mosaics: Original program largely lost; modern restoration

**The Throne**:
Charlemagne's throne—made of plain marble slabs, tradition says
from the Holy Sepulchre—stands in the gallery, facing the altar.
Thirty-one kings sat upon it for coronation.

Will Durant describes the achievement:

> "The Chapel of Aachen was the architectural manifesto of the
> Carolingian Renaissance: Roman in aspiration, Byzantine in form,
> Germanic in execution—a synthesis that announced a new civilization."
> — Will Durant, *The Age of Faith* (1950)
> [ERC: SECONDARY]

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. CHARLEMAGNE'S TOMB
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The emperor's presence sanctifies the space.

Charlemagne died at Aachen on January 28, 814. He was buried the
same day in his chapel—probably in a Roman sarcophagus that still
exists (the Proserpina sarcophagus).

Einhard records:

> "His body was washed and prepared according to custom, and was
> carried into the church and buried amid the great grief of all
> the people. Above his tomb was placed a gilded arch with his
> image and an inscription."
> — Einhard, *Vita Karoli Magni*
> [ERC: PRIMARY]

In 1000, Emperor Otto III opened the tomb and allegedly found
Charlemagne seated upright on his throne, dressed in imperial
regalia, a gospel book on his lap. The story—whether true or
legend—reinforced the cult of Charlemagne as sacred ancestor.

Frederick Barbarossa had Charlemagne canonized (1165) and
commissioned the Karlsschrein (Charlemagne Shrine, completed 1215)
to house the relics. The shrine remains in the cathedral.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. CORONATION CHURCH (936–1531)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Aachen becomes where kings become emperors.

Beginning with Otto I (936), German kings were crowned at Aachen.
The coronation ritual required:
• Procession to the cathedral
• Anointing by the Archbishop of Cologne
• Enthronement on Charlemagne's throne
• Acclamation by the assembled nobles

Widukind of Corvey describes Otto I's coronation:

> "The king was led to the throne of Charlemagne, and there he
> received the homage of all the princes. Thus was the kingdom
> of the Franks renewed in the person of the Saxons."
> — Widukind of Corvey, *Res gestae Saxonicae* (c. 970)
> [ERC: PRIMARY]

The coronation at Aachen continued until Ferdinand I (1531),
when Habsburg preference for Frankfurt and changing political
circumstances ended the tradition.

**Thirty-one coronations** occurred at Aachen:
• Otto I (936) to Ferdinand I (1531)
• Including Frederick Barbarossa (1152), who promoted the cult of Charlemagne
• Each king sat on the same throne, in the same chapel

Martyn Rady observes:

> "The Aachen coronation was not merely ceremony but constitutional
> act. By sitting on Charlemagne's throne, the new king claimed
> Carolingian inheritance—and accepted Carolingian obligation."
> — Martyn Rady, *The Habsburgs* (2020)
> [ERC: SECONDARY]

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. THE AACHEN PILGRIMAGE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The cathedral becomes a major pilgrimage destination.

Beyond Charlemagne's relics, Aachen acquired four "Great Relics"
(allegedly brought by Charlemagne from Jerusalem):
• The cloak of the Virgin Mary
• The swaddling clothes of Jesus
• The loincloth of Christ at Crucifixion
• The cloth that held John the Baptist's head

Every seven years, the **Aachen Pilgrimage** (Heiligtumsfahrt)
displays these relics. The tradition, documented since 1349,
continues today.

A medieval pilgrim recorded:

> "We came to Aachen to see the holy things that the great emperor
> brought from the Holy Land. The crowds were beyond counting, and
> the indulgences granted were beyond measuring."
> — Pilgrim account (14th century)
> [ERC: PRIMARY]

The pilgrimage generated revenue, enhanced Aachen's prestige, and
reinforced the connection between Charlemagne, Jerusalem, and the
imperial church.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. GOTHIC ADDITIONS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Later centuries expand without destroying.

The Carolingian octagon remains the core, but medieval additions
transformed the complex:

**Gothic Choir (1355–1414)**:
A vast Gothic hall church was attached to the east end, more than
doubling the cathedral's length. Its glass walls (now largely
restored after WWII) create a light-filled space contrasting with
the Carolingian darkness.

**Side Chapels**:
Various chapels were added over centuries, each with its own
patronage and function.

**The Treasury**:
Aachen's cathedral treasury is one of the richest in Europe,
containing:
• The Lothar Cross (c. 1000)
• The Karlsschrein (Charlemagne Shrine)
• The Marienschrein (containing the Great Relics)
• Carolingian gospel books and liturgical objects

The additions honored rather than replaced the original. The
octagon's status as sacred origin protected it from renovation.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VIII. SURVIVAL AND RESTORATION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The cathedral endures what destroys later structures.

**Fires and repairs**:
The building suffered fires (notably 1656) but was always restored.
The Carolingian structure proved resilient.

**Napoleonic period**:
French occupation (1794–1814) brought secularization but not
destruction. Napoleon visited the throne room.

**World War II**:
Aachen was heavily damaged (the first German city captured by
the Allies, October 1944). The cathedral was hit but survived;
restoration continued into the 1980s.

**UNESCO designation (1978)**:
The first German site inscribed on the World Heritage List,
recognized as "a masterpiece of Carolingian architecture" and
the origin point of medieval European culture.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IX. STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The cathedral's history encodes recurring Germanic patterns:

**Mearsheimer frame**: Aachen Cathedral is a claim to power made
physical. Charlemagne understood that Roman authority required
Roman forms; by building a Byzantine-style chapel with Roman
materials, he asserted equality with Constantinople. The building
was a strategic communication—not to God, but to rival powers
and future generations.

**Barnes frame**: Who paid for Aachen? The treasury of conquered
peoples—Saxon tribute, Avar gold, Italian plunder—funded
construction. Later generations paid through pilgrimage fees,
indulgence purchases, and restoration costs. The cathedral
extracted resources from each era that claimed its legitimacy.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
X. CIVILIZATIONAL LEGACY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The cathedral's significance: Germania's founding monument.

Key legacies:
• The physical link between Charlemagne and all subsequent claimants
• The architectural prototype for Carolingian-Romanesque churches
• The coronation tradition (936–1531)
• The pilgrimage tradition (1349–present)
• UNESCO World Heritage status (first German site)
• The throne, shrine, and relics as legitimacy objects

A.J.P. Taylor's observation applies:

> "The history of the Germans is a history of extremes. It contains
> everything except moderation."
> — A.J.P. Taylor, *The Course of German History* (1945)
> [ERC: SECONDARY]

Aachen Cathedral represents the origin of this pattern: Charlemagne's
extreme ambition to recreate Rome, his extreme violence in imposing
Christianity, his extreme construction program—all encoded in a
building that has transmitted his authority for twelve centuries.
