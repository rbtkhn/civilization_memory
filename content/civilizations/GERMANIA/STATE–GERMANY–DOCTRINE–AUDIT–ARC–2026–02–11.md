## Doctrine-by-doctrine assessment (ARC-attributed)

### DOCTRINE 01 — COMPETENCE-DERIVED LEGITIMACY

*Definition (from CIV–DOCTRINE–GERMANY):* Authority persists only while institutions deliver reliability, provisioning, and functional order; legitimacy erodes through performance failure; moral substitution accelerates decay.

**Evidence from ARC sources:**

- *(Source: Deutsche Bundesbank, ARC–GERMANIA–OFFICIAL; Editorial note: German central bank; conservative on fiscal matters.)* Bundesbank’s December 2025 forecast has the German economy “gradually recovering,” with real GDP growth of about 0.6% in 2026 and stronger acceleration in 2027, driven by rising government spending and a rebound in exports. The same outlook notes that rising defence and infrastructure spending and tax/transfer measures will raise deficits over the horizon — i.e. delivery (growth, fiscal sustainability) is conditional on policy choices.  
- *(Source: ifo Institute, ARC–GERMANIA–RESEARCH; Editorial note: University-affiliated; influential on German economic debate.)* ifo’s winter forecast (Dec 2025) expects GDP growth of 0.8% in 2026 and notes that US tariffs could subtract up to 0.6 percentage points from 2026 growth, while planned government investments add about 0.3 pp. ifo Business Climate Index was unchanged in January 2026 (87.6), signalling weak momentum; export expectations improved only slightly. That frames legitimacy in terms of **delivery** (growth, business climate) rather than narrative alone.

**Verdict:** **CONSISTENT.** Official and research sources emphasise growth, fiscal path, and business climate as the variables that matter — consistent with competence-derived legitimacy. No ARC-sourced claim in this window contradicts the doctrine; stress on delivery (weak momentum, deficit pressures) aligns with “failure is technical before it is ideological.”

### DOCTRINE 02 — REPLACEMENT BEFORE EXPANSION

*Definition:* Power from replacing personnel, materiel, and processes faster than loss; expansion that degrades replacement depth = structural decay; financial growth cannot offset industrial attrition.

**Evidence from ARC sources:**

- *(Source: Bundesregierung, ARC–GERMANIA–OFFICIAL; Editorial note: German federal government; primary authority on policy intent.)* The federal government highlights the Annual Economic Report 2026 with a focus on investment and reforms, and a “Security and defence industry strategy” to boost the defence industrial base — i.e. building **replacement** capacity (industrial base, capability) rather than announcing reach without depth.  
- *(Source: Bundestag / Bundesregierung, ARC–GERMANIA–OFFICIAL.)* The Bundestag approved a special fund (100 billion euros) to strengthen the Bundeswehr; the Chancellor framed the 2026 budget debate in “historic times are testing times” and stressed strengthening deterrence and defence. That frames spending as **replacement and depth** (force structure, readiness), not territorial expansion.  
- *(Source: Bundesbank, ARC–GERMANIA–OFFICIAL.)* The Bundesbank’s forecast warns that rising defence and infrastructure spending will raise deficits later in the horizon — i.e. replacement (defence, infrastructure) is explicitly traded off against fiscal sustainability, which the doctrine treats as the binding constraint (economic optimisation that erodes replacement is illegitimate).

**Verdict:** **CONSISTENT.** Policy is described in terms of strengthening armed forces and defence industry (replacement depth). Deficit warnings keep the tension between “replacement” and “financial sustainability” visible; no ARC-sourced evidence in this window shows expansion prioritised over replacement depth.

---

### DOCTRINE 03 — SEQUENCED PRECISION (Endurance → Precision → Closure)

*Definition:* Decisive precision only after endurance is secured and only with an enforced stopping rule; precision without endurance or closure converts competence into risk.

**Evidence from ARC sources:**

- No ARC-retrieved item in this run described a discrete “precision” operation (e.g. limited strike, targeted intervention) or a stopping rule for a current campaign. Defence and NATO policy are framed as endurance (readiness, deterrence) and alliance integration.

**Verdict:** **NO CLEAR SIGNAL.** Doctrine not tested by the ARC-sourced material in this audit window.

---

### DOCTRINE 04 — DISCIPLINE INVERSION FAILURE

*Definition:* When operational excellence uncouples from political restraint, discipline inverts into overreach; precision success increases risk absent restraint.

**Evidence from ARC sources:**

- No ARC-retrieved item in this run described a case of operational success without political restraint or a loss of political control over capability.

**Verdict:** **NO CLEAR SIGNAL.**

---

### DOCTRINE 05 — EXIT-BUILDING META-DOCTRINE

*Definition:* Survivability through silent withdrawal mechanisms; exit ≠ failure; hedging preserves continuity; exit must remain non-catastrophic.

**Evidence from ARC sources:**

- *(Source: SWP, ARC–GERMANIA–RESEARCH; Editorial note: Government-funded but editorially independent; centrist.)* SWP’s work on “Consolidating Germany’s Russia policy” describes the Zeitenwende as a reorientation (arms to Ukraine, sanctions, energy, defence) and calls for consolidating these changes into a coherent medium- to long-term Russia policy — i.e. **structured adaptation** rather than either permanent commitment or sudden rupture. That is consistent with exit-building as hedging and continuity-preserving adjustment.

**Verdict:** **CONSISTENT.** No ARC-sourced evidence of catastrophic or involuntary exit; SWP frames policy as consolidation and coherent long-term posture, consistent with “hedging preserves continuity.”

---

### DOCTRINE 06 — CORRIDOR DEPTH OVER DISPERSED REACH

*Definition:* Stability requires concentrated corridor depth; authority and liability co-located; dispersed reach cannot replace corridor depth; eastern projection beyond Oder recreates liability.

**Evidence from ARC sources:**

- *(Source: Bundesregierung, ARC–GERMANIA–OFFICIAL.)* Emphasis is on strengthening the Bundeswehr and the defence industry (capability and industrial depth in the national/NATO corridor), not on new territorial or expeditionary commitments beyond existing alliance obligations.  
- *(Source: SWP, ARC–GERMANIA–RESEARCH.)* The planned US ground-launched medium-range missiles in Germany (2026) are described as strengthening NATO deterrence and “hold at risk” against Russian deep-strike — i.e. **depth and deterrence** in the central European corridor, not dispersal of German force eastward.  
- No ARC-sourced item in this run described German-led eastern projection beyond the Oder or dispersal of authority without co-located liability.

**Verdict:** **CONSISTENT.** Policy is described as deepening capability and deterrence in the corridor; no evidence of trading depth for dispersed reach.

---

### DOCTRINE 07 — CENTRAL POSITION ENCIRCLEMENT CONSTRAINT

*Definition:* Central position creates permanent encirclement liability; simultaneous great-power opposition on multiple fronts = defeat; diplomatic separation of adversaries is existential; 1914 and 1941 are binding negative templates.

**Evidence from ARC sources:**

- *(Source: SWP, ARC–GERMANIA–RESEARCH.)* SWP notes that NATO’s partnership architecture has become heterogeneous and that the broader multilateral security order (e.g. OSCE) is under strain after Russia’s war and US disengagement — i.e. **alliance and partnership management** in a contested environment. US–Germany agreement to deploy US medium-range missiles in Germany in 2026 is framed as strengthening NATO deterrence and “hold at risk,” which is consistent with **avoiding isolation** and keeping the US embedded in European defence (diplomatic separation of adversaries: Russia vs NATO, not Germany alone).  
- *(Source: European Commission, ARC–GERMANIA–OFFICIAL; Editorial note: EU executive; institutional bias toward integration.)* Germany’s Draft Budgetary Plan 2026 and the Commission’s opinion situate German fiscal policy inside the EU framework — i.e. Germany acting within multilateral rules rather than unilateral great-power posture.

**Verdict:** **CONSISTENT.** ARC-sourced material shows alliance embedding (NATO, EU) and US–Germany cooperation on deterrence, with no suggestion of simultaneous great-power opposition or strategic isolation.

---

### DOCTRINE 08 — ALLIANCE DEPENDENCY AS STRUCTURAL NECESSITY

*Definition:* Alliance embedding is structural necessity; independence is illusory; alliance exit triggers encirclement; alliance must provide exit options (per DOCTRINE 05).

**Evidence from ARC sources:**

- *(Source: Bundesregierung / Bundestag, ARC–GERMANIA–OFFICIAL.)* The special fund for the Bundeswehr and the emphasis on deterrence and defence are set in the context of **NATO** and European defence, not sovereign stand-alone capability.  
- *(Source: SWP, ARC–GERMANIA–RESEARCH.)* US medium-range missiles in Germany are framed as a **US–Germany** commitment within NATO, and SWP’s work on NATO partnerships and Russia policy assumes continued alliance membership and burden-sharing.  
- *(Source: European Commission, ARC–GERMANIA–OFFICIAL.)* Germany’s 2026 DBP is submitted to the Commission under the EU framework — i.e. fiscal policy embedded in EU rules.  
- *(Source: IISS, ARC–GERMANIA–SPECIALIST; Editorial note: London-based; Western-aligned; industry-standard data.)* IISS analysis of European defence spending places Germany in a **European and transatlantic** context (spending trends, EU initiatives), not as an independent great-power military.

**Verdict:** **CONSISTENT.** All ARC-sourced evidence describes German policy in an alliance and EU context; no suggestion of alliance exit or unilateral great-power posture.

**Overall:** No doctrine is **contradicted** by the ARC-sourced evidence in this run. Doctrines 01, 02, 05, 06, 07, 08 are **consistent** with official and research sources; 03 and 04 have **no clear signal** in the material consulted.

**Limitations:**  
- Evidence window is forecasts and policy through early 2026; not all documents are dated within the “past 7 days” but they are the current authoritative ARC-sourced view of 2026.  
- NEWS category (DPA, FAZ, Spiegel, Süddeutsche) was not populated with a specific February 2026 article in this run; a follow-up could add NEWS-sourced items.  
- Contradictions between sources (e.g. Bundesbank vs ifo growth numbers) are noted in the text where relevant (e.g. 0.6% vs 0.8% 2026 growth); both are ARC-listed and retained.
