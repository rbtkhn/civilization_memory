I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves the Silesian Wars as **Germania's defining
mid-eighteenth-century conflict sequence**: the three wars (1740–1742,
1744–1745, 1756–1763) through which Prussia seized, retained, and
permanently secured Silesia from Habsburg Austria.

The Silesian Wars are not peripheral dynastic contests.
They are the **structural origin of German dualism** and the validation
of Prussia's survival model under maximum coalition pressure.

For Germania, these wars encode the lesson that **initiative plus
administrative depth can defeat legitimacy plus numbers**.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. FIRST SILESIAN WAR (1740–1742)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Frederick II invaded Silesia in December 1740, weeks after Emperor
Charles VI's death left Maria Theresa with a contested succession.

Blanning characterizes the invasion:

> "European history's most famous smash-and-grab raid."
> — Tim Blanning, *Frederick the Great: King of Prussia* (2015)

Operational characteristics:
• Immediate mobilization upon Habsburg succession crisis
• Minimal legal justification (dubious inheritance claims)
• Maximum speed to preempt coalition formation
• Limited territorial objective (Silesia only)

Key battle: Mollwitz (April 1741)
• Prussian infantry discipline compensated for cavalry failure
• Frederick fled the field; his generals won without him
• Victory demonstrated systemic strength over personal genius

Treaty of Breslau (1742): Austria ceded most of Silesia to Prussia.

Frederick acknowledged the calculated nature:

> "The question was not whether my cause was just, but whether delay
> would render it hopeless. Opportunity, once lost, does not return."
> — Frederick II, correspondence, 1740

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. SECOND SILESIAN WAR (1744–1745)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Frederick reinvaded when Austrian recovery threatened Prussian gains.

Context:
• Austria regrouping after initial losses
• Anti-Prussian coalition forming
• Frederick struck preemptively to disrupt coordination

Blanning emphasizes Frederick's risk tolerance:

> "The soldier, aesthete and enlightened monarch was, at heart... a gambler
> playing for the highest stakes. A taste for risk set Frederick's course
> from the start."
> — Tim Blanning, *Frederick the Great: King of Prussia* (2015)

Key battles:
• Hohenfriedberg (June 1745): decisive Prussian victory
• Soor (September 1745): Frederick nearly surprised; recovered through discipline
• Kesselsdorf (December 1745): Saxon defeat opened Dresden

Treaty of Dresden (1745): confirmed Silesian cession; Frederick
recognized Maria Theresa's husband as Emperor.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. THIRD SILESIAN WAR / SEVEN YEARS' WAR (1756–1763)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Third Silesian War merged with the global Seven Years' War when
Kaunitz's Diplomatic Revolution isolated Prussia against Austria,
France, Russia, Sweden, and Saxony.

Coalition objective: Silesian recovery through Prussian destruction.

Fred Anderson captures the existential stakes:

> "The war that followed was, for Prussia, a struggle for survival
> against the greatest combination of powers any European state had
> ever confronted."
> — Fred Anderson, *Crucible of War* (2000)

Frederick's strategic situation:
• Surrounded on all sides
• Outnumbered 3:1 in potential forces
• No territorial depth
• Only British subsidies as external support

Key battles:
• Lobositz (1756): preemptive strike into Saxony
• Prague (1757): costly victory, failed siege
• Kolin (1757): first major defeat; Austria regains initiative
• Rossbach (1757): crushing defeat of French-Imperial army
• Leuthen (1757): masterpiece of oblique order against Austria
• Zorndorf (1758): bloody stalemate against Russia
• Kunersdorf (1759): catastrophic defeat; Prussia nearly destroyed
• Torgau (1760): Pyrrhic victory; exhaustion on all sides

Survival mechanisms:
• Replacement depth: Prussia could rebuild armies repeatedly
• Administrative-military integration: state served the army
• Coalition fragility: allies had divergent objectives
• Russian defection (1762): Peter III's accession saved Prussia

Treaty of Hubertusburg (1763): Status quo ante bellum.
Silesia remained Prussian. Prussia remained intact.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. PRUSSIAN SURVIVAL MODEL VALIDATED
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Silesian Wars validated the Hohenzollern state model.

Fred Anderson emphasizes the systemic lesson:

> "What distinguished Prussia was not victory in battle so much as
> survival after defeat. Again and again, Frederick's armies were
> broken, only to reappear months later, scarred but intact, sustained
> by an administrative state that could still extract men and money."
> — Fred Anderson, *Crucible of War* (2000)

Validated principles:
• Standing armies require standing administration
• Discipline compensates for inferior numbers
• Limited objectives preserve optionality
• Coalition enemies eventually defect

The Prussian model—army-state fusion, meritocratic bureaucracy,
permanent mobilization—proved survivable under maximum pressure.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. HABSBURG WOUND AND GERMAN DUALISM
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
For Austria, Silesia's loss was never accepted—only accommodated.

Martyn Rady observes:

> "The loss of Silesia was the great wound of Habsburg memory. Maria
> Theresa never reconciled herself to it; she merely learned to live
> with the humiliation."
> — Martyn Rady, *The Habsburgs* (2020)

Consequences:
• Permanent Austria-Prussia rivalry (German dualism)
• Habsburg reform programs (Theresian, Josephine)
• Diplomatic Revolution reversed alliance patterns
• German space became contested rather than unified

The Silesian Wars created the structural conditions resolved only
by Prussia's victory in 1866.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. MEARSHEIMER STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

VII.A. POWER DISTRIBUTION
Silesia's seizure instantly altered Central European power distribution.
Prussia doubled its resources; Austria lost proportionally. The balance
between German powers shifted permanently.

VII.B. OFFENSIVE ADVANTAGE
Frederick's 1740 invasion demonstrated that offensive operations succeed
when opponents are distracted. Speed defeats legitimacy when enforcement
capacity is absent.

VII.C. COALITION DYNAMICS
The Silesian Wars demonstrated that coalition depth cannot substitute
for coalition cohesion. Austria assembled overwhelming numbers; coordination
failures and Russian defection prevented decisive victory.

VII.D. REPLACEMENT DEPTH
The Prussian administrative-military system validated Anderson's thesis:
states organized for permanent war readiness can absorb punishment that
should destroy them.

IX. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Initiative without legitimacy can succeed if speed prevents coalition.
• Administrative depth determines survival under attrition.
• Coalition enemies have divergent objectives; patience exploits fractures.
• Limited objectives preserve maneuver space; total objectives invite exhaustion.
• Wounds not healed (Silesia) structure future conflicts (1866).
• German dualism originated in the Silesian Wars and persisted for 123 years.

Tension preserved without verdict.

X. PEDAGOGICAL AFFORDANCE LAYER
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This MEM supports curiosity-led exploration.

Exploration prompts may include:
A) What if Frederick had not invaded in 1740?
B) Compare Frederick's survival in 1759 to Napoleon's collapse in 1812.
C) Why did Russia's defection save Prussia when Austria remained hostile?
D) How did the Silesian Wars create the conditions for 1866?

No option implies correctness. Exploration governs progression.
