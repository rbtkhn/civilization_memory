I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves France as **Germania's defining adversary**:
the western neighbor whose rivalry shaped German identity, whose
wars punctuated German history, and whose reconciliation became
the foundation of European integration.

France is not remembered as a peripheral threat.
It is remembered as **the rival against whom Germany measured
itself**—the power that established what Germany was not.

For Germania, France represents the thousand-year competition for
European primacy. From the Carolingian partition (843) through
three modern wars (1870, 1914, 1939), the German-French
relationship defined the European state system. Their
reconciliation (1963) transformed European politics as
fundamentally as their conflicts had.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. THE CAROLINGIAN PARTITION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Germany and France emerged from the same empire:

TREATY OF VERDUN (843):
Charlemagne's grandsons divided his empire into three kingdoms.
Charles the Bald received West Francia (future France); Louis
the German received East Francia (future Germany); Lothar
received the Middle Kingdom (future battleground).

> "The Treaty of Verdun created France and Germany as separate
> entities from a common Carolingian inheritance. The Middle
> Kingdom—stretching from the North Sea to Italy—became the
> territory over which they would fight for a millennium."
> — Peter H. Wilson, *Heart of Europe* (2016), p. 89
> [ERC: SECONDARY]

LOTHARINGIA:
The Middle Kingdom fragmented. Its components—Burgundy, Lorraine,
Alsace, the Rhineland—became the contested zone. Neither France
nor Germany could accept the other's control of this territory.

LINGUISTIC DIVISION:
The Strasbourg Oaths (842) recorded the first texts in distinct
Romance and Germanic languages. Language marked the emerging
national boundary.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. MEDIEVAL COMPETITION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
France and Germany competed for European leadership:

CAPETIAN CONSOLIDATION:
While German emperors pursued Italian ambitions, French kings
consolidated their domain. By 1300, France was the most powerful
kingdom in Western Europe; the Empire remained fragmented.

PAPAL ALLIANCE:
France cultivated papal alliance against imperial claims. The
Avignon papacy (1309–1377) represented French capture of the
institution emperors claimed to protect.

> "The medieval competition established the pattern: France
> consolidated while Germany fragmented. French kings built
> a kingdom; German emperors claimed an empire they could not
> govern. By the late Middle Ages, the balance had shifted
> decisively westward."
> — Brendan Simms, *Europe: The Struggle for Supremacy* (2013), p. 42
> [ERC: SECONDARY]

BURGUNDY:
The Duchy of Burgundy (1363–1477) represented the Middle Kingdom
resurgent. Its absorption—partly by France, partly by Habsburg
marriage—intensified the competition.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. HABSBURG-VALOIS RIVALRY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The sixteenth century brought systematic warfare:

CHARLES V'S ENCIRCLEMENT:
Habsburg territories surrounded France: Spain, the Netherlands,
Franche-Comté, Austria, and imperial claims to Italy. Francis I
faced strategic encirclement.

ITALIAN WARS (1494–1559):
France and the Habsburgs fought for Italian dominance. The
Peace of Cateau-Cambrésis (1559) ended French Italian ambitions
and established Habsburg predominance.

> "The Habsburg-Valois rivalry was the first modern great-power
> competition. France faced encirclement by a single dynasty
> controlling Spain, Austria, the Netherlands, and the Empire.
> French policy for two centuries aimed at breaking that ring."
> — A.J.P. Taylor, *The Struggle for Mastery in Europe* (1954), p. 8
> [ERC: SECONDARY]

FRENCH INTERVENTION:
During the Thirty Years' War, France (Catholic) allied with
Protestant powers against the Catholic Habsburgs. Raison d'état
trumped religious solidarity.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. LOUIS XIV AND GERMAN DISMEMBERMENT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Louis XIV pursued systematic German territorial reduction:

RHINELAND ACQUISITIONS:
The reunions policy claimed territories allegedly dependent on
French possessions. Alsace, Strasbourg (1681), and other
Rhineland territories were absorbed.

PALATINATE DEVASTATION (1688–1697):
The War of the League of Augsburg included deliberate destruction
of the Palatinate. Cities were burned; populations displaced.
The devastation became a German memory of French aggression.

> "Louis XIV's wars established France as Germany's primary
> threat. The Palatinate devastation—systematic, deliberate,
> designed to create a wasteland—burned into German memory.
> France was not merely a rival; France was the destroyer."
> — Peter H. Wilson, *Heart of Europe* (2016), p. 456
> [ERC: SECONDARY]

GERMAN FRAGMENTATION:
French policy exploited German division. Louis cultivated
German princes against the emperor; subsidies flowed to
potential allies; the Empire remained divided.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. REVOLUTIONARY AND NAPOLEONIC TRANSFORMATION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The French Revolution destroyed the old European order:

REVOLUTIONARY WARS:
Revolutionary France expanded eastward. The left bank of the
Rhine was annexed (1795–1797); the Holy Roman Empire's western
territories were absorbed.

HOLY ROMAN EMPIRE DISSOLUTION (1806):
Napoleon's reorganization eliminated the Empire. The
Reichsdeputationshauptschluss (1803) secularized ecclesiastical
territories; the Confederation of the Rhine (1806) created
French satellite states; Francis II abdicated the imperial title.

> "Napoleon destroyed the Holy Roman Empire more completely than
> any enemy had managed in eight centuries. He reorganized Germany
> according to French interests, creating the preconditions for
> later unification by eliminating the ecclesiastical states and
> rationalizing the political map."
> — Christopher Clark, *Iron Kingdom* (2006), p. 297
> [ERC: SECONDARY]

PRUSSIAN CATASTROPHE:
Prussia's defeat at Jena-Auerstedt (1806) and the humiliating
Peace of Tilsit (1807) reduced Prussia to a French satellite.
The catastrophe prompted Prussian reform.

WARS OF LIBERATION (1813–1815):
German states joined the coalition that defeated Napoleon.
Leipzig (1813) and Waterloo (1815) became German national
memories. Victory did not produce German unification.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. NINETEENTH-CENTURY ANTAGONISM
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The century produced escalating rivalry:

RHINE CRISIS (1840):
French demands for the Rhine frontier provoked German
nationalist response. "Die Wacht am Rhein" expressed German
determination to hold the river.

> "The Rhine Crisis of 1840 demonstrated that German nationalism
> defined itself against France. The river was not merely a
> geographic feature; it was the line France must not cross.
> German identity consolidated around French exclusion."
> — Brendan Simms, *Europe: The Struggle for Supremacy* (2013), p. 198
> [ERC: SECONDARY]

AUSTRO-PRUSSIAN WAR (1866):
French neutrality enabled Prussian victory over Austria.
Napoleon III expected compensation for his restraint;
Bismarck provided none.

EMS TELEGRAM (1870):
Bismarck's edited telegram provoked French declaration of war.
The Franco-Prussian War was the war Bismarck wanted.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VIII. THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The war of 1870–1871 transformed European politics:

MILITARY CAMPAIGN:
Prussian-led forces defeated French armies at Sedan (September
1870) and besieged Paris. Napoleon III was captured; the Second
Empire collapsed; the Third Republic emerged during war.

GERMAN UNIFICATION:
Wilhelm I was proclaimed German Emperor at Versailles (January
1871). German unification occurred in France's palace—a
deliberate humiliation.

> "The proclamation at Versailles was designed to wound. German
> unity was announced in the palace of Louis XIV, the king who
> had devastated the Palatinate. The symbolism was unmistakable:
> Germany had reversed centuries of French predominance."
> — A.J.P. Taylor, *The Struggle for Mastery in Europe* (1954), p. 218
> [ERC: SECONDARY]

ALSACE-LORRAINE:
Germany annexed Alsace and part of Lorraine. The loss became
France's permanent grievance; revanche defined French policy
for forty years.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IX. WORLD WAR I
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Great War was the rivalry's catastrophic culmination:

ALLIANCE SYSTEMS:
France allied with Russia (1894) and Britain (1904) to counter
German power. Germany faced the two-front war its strategists
feared.

SCHLIEFFEN PLAN:
German strategy required rapid French defeat before Russian
mobilization. The plan violated Belgian neutrality and brought
British intervention.

WESTERN FRONT:
Four years of trench warfare centered on French territory.
Verdun (1916) became the war's symbol: 700,000 casualties in
a single battle; territory measured in meters.

> "Verdun was the Franco-German war concentrated to its essence:
> attrition without decision, sacrifice without gain, destruction
> as strategy. Both nations bled there; neither won. The battle
> embodied the rivalry's logic carried to absurdity."
> — Christopher Clark, *Iron Kingdom* (2006), p. 558
> [ERC: SECONDARY]

VERSAILLES (1919):
France dictated terms: Alsace-Lorraine returned; Rhineland
demilitarized and occupied; reparations imposed; war guilt
assigned. Germany experienced the humiliation France had
suffered in 1871.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
X. WORLD WAR II
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The second war exceeded the first in destruction:

FALL OF FRANCE (1940):
Germany conquered France in six weeks—revenge for four years
of stalemate. The armistice was signed in the same railway
carriage used in 1918.

OCCUPATION:
German occupation divided France: Vichy collaboration in the
south; direct rule in the north; exploitation throughout.
French industry served German war production.

> "The German occupation of France was both revenge and
> exploitation. The humiliations of 1918 were systematically
> reversed: the armistice carriage, the Versailles ceremony,
> the occupation itself. Germany had won the Franco-German
> war—temporarily."
> — A.J.P. Taylor, *The Origins of the Second World War* (1961), p. 278
> [ERC: SECONDARY]

LIBERATION (1944):
Allied forces liberated France. De Gaulle's entry into Paris
restored French sovereignty; France received occupation zone
in Germany and permanent Security Council seat.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
XI. RECONCILIATION AND INTEGRATION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The post-war era transformed the relationship:

SCHUMAN DECLARATION (1950):
Robert Schuman proposed pooling French and German coal and
steel production—the industries of war. The European Coal
and Steel Community (1951) began integration.

> "The Schuman Declaration was revolutionary precisely because
> it was obvious. Coal and steel had fueled the Franco-German
> wars; pooling them made war impossible. The enemies of
> centuries became partners in production."
> — Brendan Simms, *Europe: The Struggle for Supremacy* (2013), p. 456
> [ERC: SECONDARY]

ÉLYSÉE TREATY (1963):
De Gaulle and Adenauer signed the treaty of friendship. Regular
consultations, youth exchanges, and coordinated policies
institutionalized reconciliation.

EUROPEAN INTEGRATION:
The Franco-German partnership drove European integration: the
Common Market (1957), the single currency (1999), enlargement
(2004). The relationship that had destabilized Europe for
centuries became the stabilizing core.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
XII. DOCTRINAL IMPLICATIONS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
France instantiates the SYSTEMIC RIVALRY pattern:

PATTERN: Two powers of comparable strength compete for regional
primacy; neither can eliminate the other; the competition
structures the entire regional system; resolution requires
either decisive victory or institutional transformation.

APPLICABLE DOCTRINES:
• DOCTRINE 04: Multi-Vector Alliance Necessity — Germany
  required alliances against French power; Bismarck's system
  aimed to isolate France
• DOCTRINE 06: Corridor Depth Over Dispersed Reach — Rhineland
  represented the corridor between France and Germany

RLL CONNECTION:
• RLL–GERMANIA–0001 (Land Power Constraint): Germany faced
  enemies on multiple frontiers; France was the western constant
• RLL–GERMANIA–0008 (Encirclement Anxiety): French alliances
  with Russia created two-front threat

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
XIII. MEM CONNECTIONS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
SAME-CIVILIZATION CONNECTIONS (GERMANIA):

• MEM–GERMANIA–BISMARCK
  Dependency: Architect of French defeat and isolation. Bismarck
  engineered 1870 war, imposed terms, built alliance system to isolate France.
  Breaks if removed: Unification strategy unexplained; why France was
  target of diplomatic isolation has no agent.

• MEM–GERMANIA–WAR–FRANCO–PRUSSIAN
  Dependency: War creating unified Germany at France's expense. Sedan,
  siege of Paris, Versailles proclamation.
  Breaks if removed: 1871 unification has no precipitating event;
  Alsace-Lorraine annexation loses context.

• MEM–GERMANIA–CHARLEMAGNE
  Dependency: Common Carolingian origin. Verdun (843) = divorce of
  France and Germany from same empire.
  Breaks if removed: Why France and Germany share origin but diverged
  unintelligible; Middle Kingdom contest loses precedent.

• MEM–GERMANIA–HOLY–ROMAN–EMPIRE
  Dependency: Institution France helped destroy. Napoleonic dissolution
  (1806) ended what French expansion weakened.
  Breaks if removed: Empire dissolution appears internal; French agency
  in German fragmentation disappears.

• MEM–GERMANIA–PRUSSIA
  Dependency: State leading anti-French wars. Wars of Liberation, 1870,
  1914, 1940 all led from Prussian base.
  Breaks if removed: German anti-French capacity appears stateless;
  military instrument has no institutional anchor.

• MEM–GERMANIA–DYNASTY–HAPSBURG
  Dependency: Dynasty in Habsburg-Valois rivalry. Charles V encirclement;
  Italian Wars; sixteenth-century systematic warfare.
  Breaks if removed: Early modern Franco-German competition has no
  German agent; Habsburg-Valois rivalry disappears.

• MEM–GERMANIA–HITLER
  Dependency: WWII occupation of France. 1940 conquest; Vichy; armistice
  carriage symbolism.
  Breaks if removed: 20th-century rivalry peak missing; 1940 revenge for
  1918 undocumented.

• MEM–GERMANIA–WILHELM–II
  Dependency: WWI German leadership. Decision for war; Schlieffen Plan
  execution; eventual defeat.
  Breaks if removed: Great War German side has no decision-maker;
  1914–1918 appears leaderless.

• MEM–GERMANIA–LOTHARINGIA
  Dependency: Middle Kingdom—the territory France and Germany contested
  for millennium.
  Breaks if removed: Geographic object of rivalry disappears; what they
  fought over unintelligible.

GEO–MEM CONNECTIONS:

• MEM–GERMANIA–GEO–RHINE–RIVER
  Dependency: River as Franco-German boundary and contest zone. Rhine
  frontier doctrine vs. German cultural claims.
  Breaks if removed: Geographic dimension missing; "Die Wacht am Rhein"
  loses river referent.

• MEM–GERMANIA–ALSACE–LORRAINE
  Dependency: Contested territory exemplifying rivalry. 1871 annexation;
  1918 return; 1940 re-annexation; 1945 final return.
  Breaks if removed: Territorial oscillation undocumented; revanche loses
  geographic focus.

CROSS-CIVILIZATION CONNECTIONS:

• MEM–FRANCIA–LOUIS–XIV
  Dependency: French expansion into Germany. Reunions policy; Palatinate
  devastation; Strasbourg seizure.
  Breaks if removed: 17th-century French aggression undocumented; why
  Germans remember France as destroyer unexplained.

• MEM–FRANCIA–NAPOLEON
  Dependency: Revolutionary transformation of German space. Empire
  dissolution; Confederation of Rhine; Prussian catastrophe and reform.
  Breaks if removed: 1806 dissolution has no agent; why German nationalism
  emerged against France unintelligible.

• MEM–FRANCIA–DE–GAULLE
  Dependency: Reconciliation partner. Élysée Treaty co-signer; French
  side of post-war transformation.
  Breaks if removed: Reconciliation appears one-sided German initiative;
  French agency in transformation disappears.
