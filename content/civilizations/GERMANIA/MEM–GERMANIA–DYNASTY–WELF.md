I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves the Welf dynasty as **Germania's oldest
continuously traceable noble house**: the family that contested
with the Hohenstaufen for imperial power, ruled duchies from
Bavaria to Saxony, provided Britain's kings for 123 years, and
continues through the House of Windsor to the present day.

For Germania, the Welfs represent **dynastic persistence without
supremacy**. Unlike the Habsburgs (who achieved hegemony) or the
Hohenzollerns (who unified Germany), the Welfs remained perpetual
contenders—powerful enough to matter, never dominant enough to
prevail, always surviving to contest another generation.

Martyn Rady captures the pattern:

> "The Welfs are Germany's great survivors. Other dynasties rose
> higher and fell harder; the Welfs endured, adapting to each new
> political order while never quite conquering it."
> — Martyn Rady, *The Habsburgs* (2020)
> [ERC: SECONDARY]

The dynasty's trajectory—from Carolingian allies to Hohenstaufen
rivals to Hanoverian kings to Prussian victims—encodes the full
arc of German political history.

This file records the Welfs as the **adaptable survivors**:
demonstrating how dynastic continuity can outlast political defeat.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

II. ORIGINS: THE CAROLINGIAN CONNECTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Welfs emerge as Carolingian allies.

The dynasty's traceable origins reach to the 8th century. Welf I
(d. c. 825) married a daughter of Louis the Pious; subsequent
Welfs intermarried with Carolingian and post-Carolingian royalty.

Key early figures:
• Welf I (d. c. 825): Allied with Louis the Pious
• Judith of Bavaria (d. 843): Empress, wife of Louis the Pious
• The Swabian Welfs: Established in southern Germany

A medieval genealogist recorded:

> "The House of Welf is among the most ancient of German houses,
> its blood mingled with emperors from the time of Charlemagne's
> sons. No family can trace a nobler line."
> — *Historia Welforum* (12th century)
> [ERC: PRIMARY]

The Carolingian connection provided legitimacy that later
acquisitions would build upon.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. DUKES OF BAVARIA AND SAXONY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Welfs become major territorial rulers.

In the 11th–12th centuries, the Welfs acquired both Bavaria
and Saxony—making them the most powerful German dynasty outside
the imperial family.

**Henry the Black** (d. 1126): Duke of Bavaria
**Henry the Proud** (d. 1139): Duke of Bavaria and Saxony
**Henry the Lion** (1129–1195): The greatest Welf ruler

Henry the Lion held both duchies simultaneously, controlled
territory from the Alps to the Baltic, and rivaled the emperor
himself.

Otto of Freising described the family's power:

> "The Welfs hold such vast domains that the emperor himself
> must treat with them as near-equals. Their wealth in lands
> and vassals exceeds all other princes."
> — Otto of Freising, *Gesta Friderici* (c. 1158)
> [ERC: PRIMARY]

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. WELF VS. WAIBLINGEN (GUELPH VS. GHIBELLINE)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The dynastic rivalry shapes European politics.

The contest between Welfs and Hohenstaufen (called "Waiblingen"
after their castle) became the defining conflict of 12th-century
Germany—and, exported to Italy, the Guelph-Ghibelline divide
that structured Italian politics for centuries.

The conflict's origins:
• Disputed succession after Henry V (1125)
• Welf support for Lothar II; Hohenstaufen opposition
• Alternating imperial elections
• Territorial competition in Saxony and Bavaria

The terms crossed the Alps:
• **Guelph** (Italian: Guelfi): Papal party, anti-imperial
• **Ghibelline** (Italian: Ghibellini): Imperial party, pro-Hohenstaufen

Peter Wilson notes the transformation:

> "What began as a German dynastic feud became the organizing
> principle of Italian politics for three centuries. 'Guelph'
> and 'Ghibelline' long outlasted the families that gave them
> their names."
> — Peter H. Wilson, *Heart of Europe* (2016)
> [ERC: SECONDARY]

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. HENRY THE LION: RISE AND FALL
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The dynasty's greatest figure is also its greatest overreacher.

Henry the Lion (r. 1142–1180 in Saxony, 1156–1180 in Bavaria)
built a northern empire:
• Founded Munich (1158)
• Colonized Slavic territories
• Established Lübeck as a major port
• Patronized Brunswick as his capital
• Married Matilda, daughter of Henry II of England

His downfall came from refusing to support Frederick Barbarossa's
Italian campaign (1176). Barbarossa retaliated:

> "Henry the Lion, for his contumacy and rebellion against the
> Empire, is hereby deprived of his duchies and banished from
> German lands."
> — Imperial diet judgment (1180)
> [ERC: PRIMARY]

Henry lost Bavaria and most of Saxony, retaining only Brunswick-
Lüneburg—the territory that would eventually become Hanover.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. BRUNSWICK-LÜNEBURG: THE REDUCED PATRIMONY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Welfs survive in their diminished core.

After 1180, the Welfs ruled Brunswick-Lüneburg—a fraction of
their former power but enough to maintain dynastic continuity.

The territory fragmented among branches:
• Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel
• Brunswick-Lüneburg (Hanover line)
• Brunswick-Bevern
• Other minor lines

Each branch pursued its own interests; occasional reunifications
occurred; the family remained significant without dominating.

A 17th-century observer noted:

> "The House of Brunswick, though fallen from its ancient height,
> remains among the first princes of the Empire. Its blood is
> as noble as any; its territories, if united, would rival any
> electorate."
> — Diplomatic report (c. 1650)
> [ERC: CONTEXTUAL]

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. THE HANOVERIAN ELEVATION (1692–1714)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Electoral dignity and British succession transform Welf fortunes.

Duke Ernst August of Brunswick-Lüneburg (Hanover line) secured
electoral status in 1692, making the Welfs one of the Empire's
nine electors.

The British succession (1714) elevated the family further:

> "By the Act of Settlement and the grace of Providence, the
> crown of Great Britain passes to the House of Hanover—that
> ancient German line whose Protestant faith and royal blood
> qualify them for this high dignity."
> — British proclamation (1714)
> [ERC: PRIMARY]

The Welfs had achieved what eluded them in the medieval contest:
a major crown—though British, not German.

[See MEM–GERMANIA–HANOVER for detailed treatment of the British
period]

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VIII. THE NINETEENTH-CENTURY DIVERGENCE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The British and German branches separate.

When the personal union ended (1837), the dynasty split:
• **British line**: Victoria (excluded from Hanover by Salic Law)
  continued through her children; the House of Windsor (renamed
  1917) descends from Edward VII
• **German line**: Ernest Augustus and successors ruled Hanover
  until Prussian annexation (1866), then Brunswick until 1918

The German Welfs lost their thrones but retained their claims:

> "The House of Brunswick-Lüneburg has been deprived by force
> of its rightful inheritance. We do not recognize annexation
> by conquest; our rights remain."
> — Welf protest (1866)
> [ERC: PRIMARY]

The "Guelph Fund" controversy—Bismarck's use of confiscated
Welf assets for secret political purposes—extended the conflict
into the 20th century.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IX. THE DYNASTY TODAY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Welfs survive in altered form.

**British continuation**: King Charles III descends from the
Welfs through Victoria; the House of Windsor is, genealogically,
a Welf continuation under another name.

**German continuation**: The House of Hanover continues as a
mediatized noble family. Ernst August, Prince of Hanover (b. 1954),
is the current head; his son married a princess of Monaco (2011).

The dynasty has outlived:
• The Holy Roman Empire (dissolved 1806)
• The German Empire (dissolved 1918)
• The Nazi regime
• Both World Wars

Twelve centuries of continuous traceable descent.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
X. STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Welf dynasty encodes recurring Germanic patterns:

**Mearsheimer frame**: The Welfs repeatedly reached for hegemony
and repeatedly failed—against the Hohenstaufen, against the
Habsburgs, against the Hohenzollerns. Each failure reduced their
territory but not their existence. The dynasty's survival strategy
was adaptation: accepting reduced circumstances while preserving
the dynastic core for future opportunity.

**Barnes frame**: Who benefited from Welf persistence? The dynasty
itself (maintaining noble status across 1,200 years); the British
state (gaining a Protestant succession); the territories they
ruled (varying outcomes). Losers: populations absorbed by Prussia
(1866), the German line (expelled from thrones), the nobility
that backed them.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
XI. CIVILIZATIONAL LEGACY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Welfs' significance: survival as dynastic principle.

Key legacies:
• The Guelph-Ghibelline divide (shaping Italy for centuries)
• The founding of Munich (1158)
• The British Hanoverian succession
• The House of Windsor (continuing the line)
• The demonstration that dynasties can outlast states

A.J.P. Taylor's observation applies:

> "The history of the Germans is a history of extremes. It contains
> everything except moderation."
> — A.J.P. Taylor, *The Course of German History* (1945)
> [ERC: SECONDARY]

The Welfs are the exception: the moderate dynasty, never achieving
extremity of power or suffering extremity of extinction. They
adapted, survived, and continue—the anti-Hohenstaufen, anti-
Hohenzollern, still present when those mightier houses are gone.
