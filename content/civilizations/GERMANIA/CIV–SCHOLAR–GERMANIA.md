UPGRADE NOTE (v1.2 → v2.0) — TEMPLATE v2.5 COMPLIANCE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This version upgrades CIV–SCHOLAR–GERMANIA to full CIV–SCHOLAR–TEMPLATE v2.5
compliance. This is a MAJOR upgrade that restructures the file while preserving
all previously frozen learning.

STRUCTURAL CHANGES:
• Section II: Phase Transition Declaration (ADDED)
• Section II.A: Germanic Civilizational Axioms (ADDED — derived from frozen syntheses)
• Section II.B: Negative Capability Zone (ADDED)
• Section II.C: Anomaly Flag Protocol (ADDED)
• Section II.D: Secondary Voice Invocation Format (ADDED)
• Section V: Doctrines converted to RLLs with cognitive attribution
• Section VI: SDI expanded with cross-civilization entries

PRESERVED CONTENT:
• All 9 learning entries preserved verbatim
• All 5 syntheses preserved verbatim
• All doctrine content preserved (now encoded as RLLs)
• SDI entries preserved and expanded

PHASE CLARIFICATION:
• v1.2 "LOCKED" status is now clarified as Phase II (Constraint Grammar)
• Phase II permits continued learning with RLL constraint checking
• Previous "LOCKED" was premature snapshot; now properly phased

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
I. SCHOLAR PURPOSE & ROLE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
CIV–SCHOLAR–GERMANIA is the constraint grammar layer governing all
Germanic civilizational interpretation across MEM, CORE, DOCTRINE,
GAME, and SIMULATION contexts.

This file records:
• Accumulated learning events
• Bound Recursive Learning Laws (RLLs)
• Structural constraints discovered through ingestion
• Negative capability limits (what Germania cannot stably do)

This file does NOT:
• Resolve contradictions
• Declare optimal strategies
• Rank outcomes
• Predict futures

Authority is strictly downstream of CIV–MEM–CORE and CIV–MEM–TEMPLATE.
No content here may override canonical MEM files.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. PHASE TRANSITION DECLARATION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
CIV–SCHOLAR–GERMANIA has exited **Learning Accumulation Phase**.

Condition met:
• Sufficient cross-MEM coherence (9 entries, 5 frozen syntheses)
• Recurrent pattern confirmation (trauma-restraint cycle)
• Multiple RLLs bound and non-contradictory
• Failure-mode convergence achieved (competence → catastrophe without closure)

The system now operates in **Constraint Grammar Phase (PHASE II)**.

Meaning:
• New learning is evaluated against existing constraints
• Novel claims are stress-tested for compatibility
• Apparent exceptions are treated as anomaly candidates, not refutations

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II.A GERMANIC CIVILIZATIONAL AXIOMS (v2.5 TEMPLATE FORMAT)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
These are **structural axioms**, not doctrines.
Axioms are interpretive anchors, not predictive claims.
Derived from frozen syntheses SYNTHESIS 0001–0005.

AXIOM GERMANIA-001: Discipline precedes expansion.
  Derivation: MEM–GERMANIA–CHARLEMAGNE, MEM–GERMANIA–FREDERICK–GREAT
  Scope: All governance and military expansion analysis
  Limits: Does not apply to defensive consolidation

AXIOM GERMANIA-002: Command capacity requires stopping rules.
  Derivation: SYNTHESIS 0005, MEM–GERMANIA–BISMARCK
  Scope: All legitimacy and authority analysis
  Limits: Stopping rules may be externally imposed (1945)

AXIOM GERMANIA-003: Trauma encodes permanent constraint.
  Derivation: MEM–GERMANIA–WAR–THIRTY–YEARS, SYNTHESIS 0004
  Scope: Strategic culture and war grammar analysis
  Limits: Trauma encoding may fade across generations (1914 failure)

AXIOM GERMANIA-004: Precision without closure produces catastrophe.
  Derivation: SYNTHESIS 0003, MEM–GERMANIA–WAR–FRANCO–PRUSSIAN
  Scope: War termination and political gain analysis
  Limits: External constraint may force closure (1918, 1945)

AXIOM GERMANIA-005: Legitimacy derives from restraint, not narrative.
  Derivation: SYNTHESIS 0001, MEM–GERMANIA–FREDERICK–GREAT
  Scope: Legitimacy grammar analysis
  Limits: Post-1945 Germany develops narrative-based legitimacy (Holocaust memory)

AXIOM GERMANIA-006: Endurance precedes precision.
  Derivation: SYNTHESIS 0003, MEM–GERMANIA–WAR–SEVEN–YEARS
  Scope: Strategic sequencing analysis
  Limits: Overwhelming superiority may permit precision-first

AXIOM GERMANIA-007: Administrative competence substitutes for ideological unity.
  Derivation: MEM–GERMANIA–FREDERICK–GREAT, MEM–GERMANIA–BISMARCK
  Scope: Governance capacity analysis
  Limits: Does not apply to nation-state period (post-1871)

These axioms emerged inductively from frozen syntheses and are now enforced constraints.
Axioms may be revised only when MEM evidence forces revision.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II.B NEGATIVE CAPABILITY ZONE (v2.5 TEMPLATE FORMAT)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Scholar–Germania enforces the following exclusions.
These record what Germania CANNOT stably achieve—not predictions, but constraints.

STRUCTURAL EXCLUSIONS:
─────────────────────────
[NCZ-GER-001] Ideological war as sustainable policy
  Status: INSUFFICIENT
  Reason: 1618–1648, 1914–1918, 1939–1945 all produce civilizational catastrophe
  Related MEMs: MEM–GERMANIA–WAR–THIRTY–YEARS, MEM–GERMANIA–WAR–WWI, MEM–GERMANIA–WAR–WWII
  Resolution Path: Would require counter-case of ideological war with stable outcome

[NCZ-GER-002] Imperial expansion without enforced stopping rules
  Status: INSUFFICIENT
  Reason: All expansions without closure (1914, 1939) produce system destruction
  Related MEMs: MEM–GERMANIA–BISMARCK (contrast), MEM–GERMANIA–WILHELM–II
  Resolution Path: Would require successful open-ended expansion

[NCZ-GER-003] Hegemonic ambition without administrative self-limitation
  Status: INSUFFICIENT
  Reason: German competence is exceptional; German hegemony is self-destroying
  Related MEMs: MEM–GERMANIA–FREDERICK–GREAT, MEM–GERMANIA–BISMARCK
  Resolution Path: Would require stable German hegemony case

[NCZ-GER-004] Sustained unity without external pressure
  Status: CONTESTED
  Reason: HRE fragmentation, post-1648 particularism, post-1945 division
  Related MEMs: MEM–GERMANIA–HOLY–ROMAN–EMPIRE, MEM–GERMANIA–CHARLEMAGNE
  Resolution Path: May be resolved by post-1990 reunification analysis

[NCZ-GER-005] Precision victory without subsequent closure
  Status: INSUFFICIENT
  Reason: Franco-Prussian closure validates; 1914 non-closure invalidates
  Related MEMs: MEM–GERMANIA–WAR–FRANCO–PRUSSIAN, MEM–GERMANIA–WAR–WWI
  Resolution Path: Counter-case of precision → sustained advantage without closure

WAR-SPECIFIC EXCLUSIONS:
───────────────────────────
[NCZ-GER-006] Two-front war survival without allied collapse
  Status: INSUFFICIENT
  Reason: Seven Years' War survived via allied withdrawal; 1914, 1941 did not
  Related MEMs: MEM–GERMANIA–WAR–SEVEN–YEARS, MEM–GERMANIA–WAR–WWI
  Resolution Path: Counter-case of two-front victory through German means alone

[NCZ-GER-007] Long-war advantage against coalition
  Status: INSUFFICIENT
  Reason: German replacement capacity inferior to coalition aggregate
  Related MEMs: MEM–GERMANIA–WAR–WWI, MEM–GERMANIA–WAR–WWII
  Resolution Path: Counter-case of German attrition victory

Violations require anomaly handling via Section II.C.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II.D SECONDARY VOICE INVOCATION FORMAT (v2.5 FORMALIZED)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
LEARN mode uses the Mercouris voice register as primary.

PRIMARY VOICE:
• Prose: history monograph
• Tone: exploratory, disciplined
• Finality: provisional only

SECONDARY VOICE INVOCATION:
All voice transitions MUST use standardized markers.
Markers MUST appear on their own line, not inline with prose.

STANDARD VOICE MARKERS:
  [LEARN MODE — BARNES CATALYST]
  [LEARN MODE — MEARSHEIMER SHARPENING]
  [LEARN MODE — MERCOURIS PRIMARY]
  [LEARN MODE — TRI-FRAME SYNTHESIS]

VOICE TRANSITION RULES:
• Opening marker: Required before secondary voice content begins
• Closing marker: Return to "[LEARN MODE — MERCOURIS PRIMARY]" after secondary
• Nested voices: NOT permitted (one secondary at a time)
• Secondary duration: Should be bounded, not extended

Secondary voice outputs may generate RLLs with frame attribution.
All RLLs remain subject to user authorization for binding.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. ACCUMULATED STATE & AUTHORITATIVE SOURCES
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Scholar operates with accumulated knowledge from prior learning sessions.

Starting Knowledge: ACCUMULATED (from CIV–SCHOLAR file content)
Authoritative Data Sources: ACTIVE
• CIV–CORE–GERMANIA: Structural constraints and operational logic
• CIV–DOCTRINE–GERMANIA: Frozen learning and hard constraints
• CIV–SCHOLAR–GERMANIA: Prior learning entries and synthesis history
• Loaded MEM Files: Priority layer for new learning and analysis

Civilizational Grammar: PRELOADED (from frozen syntheses)
CIV–CORE Influence: ENABLED (authoritative for structural constraints)
CIV–DOCTRINE Influence: ENABLED (authoritative for learning constraints)

The Scholar ingests MEM files to extend and refine existing knowledge.
New learning is added to the accumulated knowledge state, not created ex nihilo.

IV. INGESTED LEARNING EVENTS (CHRONOLOGICAL)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

ENTRY 0001
Source: MEM–GERMANIA–CHARLEMAGNE — v1.2
Ingest Type: Foundational Figure Memory
Primary Belief Extracted:
• Germania originates as a discipline-first civilization formed
  through coercive unification, sacral authority, and enforced order,
  not consensual federation.
Belief Status: FROZEN (via Doctrine v0.1 → RLL–GERMANIA–0001)

ENTRY 0002
Source: MEM–GERMANIA–FREDERICK–GREAT — v1.2
Ingest Type: Survival-State Governance Memory
Primary Belief Extracted:
• Germania survives existential pressure through restraint,
  bureaucratic discipline, and precision, subordinating ideology,
  culture, and intellect to state endurance.
Belief Status: FROZEN (via Doctrine v0.1 → RLL–GERMANIA–0001)

ENTRY 0003
Source: MEM–GERMANIA–BISMARCK — v1.2
Ingest Type: System-Governor Memory

ENTRY 0005
Source: MEM–GERMANIA–WAR–AUSTRIAN–SUCCESSION — v1.2
Ingest Type: Replacement-Depth Validation War
Primary Belief Extracted:

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. BELIEF SYNTHESIS LOG
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

SYNTHESIS 0001 (ENTRY 0001–0003)
Outcome:
• Germania's legitimacy derives from disciplined restraint and
  administrative control, not narrative or ideology.
Status: FROZEN → RLL–GERMANIA–0001

SYNTHESIS 0002 (ENTRY 0004–0005)
Outcome:
• Trauma punishes imperial temptation and elevates limited,
  competence-based action as survivable power.
Status: FROZEN → RLL–GERMANIA–0002

SYNTHESIS 0003 (ENTRY 0006–0007)
Outcome:
• Precision is safe only after endurance is proven and only if
  followed by immediate political closure.
Status: FROZEN → RLL–GERMANIA–0003

SYNTHESIS 0004 (ENTRY 0001–0007)
Outcome:
• German strategic learning follows a trauma-driven cycle:
  Trauma → Restraint → Endurance → Precision → Closure.
  Any inversion converts competence into catastrophe.
Status: FROZEN → RLL–GERMANIA–0004

SYNTHESIS 0005 (ENTRY 0008–0009)
Outcome:
• Germania's foundational coercive unification (sacral command) and its
  later survival-state discipline converge into a single civilizational
  rule: authority is legitimate only when command capacity is permanently
  constrained by restraint, closure, and administrative self-limitation.
  Power that expands without enforced stopping rules reverts to
  catastrophe, regardless of competence.
Status: FROZEN → RLL–GERMANIA–0005

SYNTHESIS 0006 (GEO–MEM CLUSTER)
Outcome:
• Germania’s stability depends on concentrated corridor depth
  (Rhine-type geometry). Dispersed corridor reach (Danube/Baltic/Atlantic)
  dilutes force density, externalizes liability, and makes access
  conditional. Substituting reach for depth produces exposure without
  commensurate authority.
Status: FROZEN → RLL–GERMANIA–0006

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. BOUND RECURSIVE LEARNING LAWS (RLLs)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The following RLLs are converted from frozen doctrines and are now
binding constraints per CIV–SCHOLAR–TEMPLATE v2.5.

GENERAL CIVILIZATIONAL RLLs:
────────────────────────────
RLL–GERMANIA–0001 — Disciplined Restraint Law
→ Germanic legitimacy derives from disciplined restraint and administrative
  control, not narrative or ideology. Power is legitimate when constrained;
  unconstrained power forfeits legitimacy regardless of success.
  **Mercouris derivation**: Civilizational grammar analysis; legitimacy as
  constitutive norm rather than external validation.
  Source: SYNTHESIS 0001 (ENTRY 0001–0003)
  Status: BOUND

RLL–GERMANIA–0002 — Replacement Before Expansion Law
→ Limited objectives, rapid mobilization, and administrative competence
  defeat dynastic legitimacy inside German space. Expansion is permissible
  only after replacement capacity is proven; ambition without depth is
  catastrophic.
  **Mearsheimer derivation**: Relative capabilities analysis; replacement
  depth as structural advantage over positional claims.
  Source: SYNTHESIS 0002 (ENTRY 0004–0005)
  Status: BOUND

RLL–GERMANIA–0003 — Precision Requires Closure Law
→ Precision is safe only after endurance is proven and only if followed
  by immediate political closure. Maximum political gain is achievable
  only when military precision is immediately converted into diplomatic
  stopping rules. Precision without closure → catastrophe.
  **Mearsheimer derivation**: Strategic constraint analysis; war termination
  as structural requirement for gain preservation.
  Source: SYNTHESIS 0003 (ENTRY 0006–0007)
  Status: BOUND

RLL–GERMANIA–0004 — Trauma-Encoded Strategic Learning Law
→ German strategic learning follows a trauma-driven cycle:
  Trauma → Restraint → Endurance → Precision → Closure.
  Any inversion converts competence into catastrophe. The cycle is not
  optional; it is structurally required by Germania's geographic exposure
  and historical experience.
  **Mercouris derivation**: Civilizational learning analysis; trauma as
  permanent constraint encoding rather than temporary inhibition.
  Source: SYNTHESIS 0004 (ENTRY 0001–0007)
  Status: BOUND

RLL–GERMANIA–0005 — Mandatory Closure Law
→ Authority is legitimate only when command capacity is permanently
  constrained by restraint, closure, and administrative self-limitation.
  Power that expands without enforced stopping rules reverts to catastrophe,
  regardless of competence. This is Germania's master constraint.
  **Barnes derivation**: Liability analysis; stopping rules as liability
  limitation mechanisms; open-ended power as unlimited liability exposure.
  Source: SYNTHESIS 0005 (ENTRY 0008–0009)
  Status: BOUND

RLL–GERMANIA–0006 — Corridor Depth vs Dispersed Reach Constraint
→ Germania’s stability requires concentrated corridor depth (Rhine-type geometry)
  where authority/liability remain co-located and force density is high.
  Dispersed corridor reach (Danube/Baltic/Atlantic geometries) dilutes force
  ratios, externalizes liability, and makes access conditional. Substituting
  dispersed reach for concentrated depth produces exposure without commensurate
  authority.
  **Cross-frame derivation**: Mercouris (authority–liability congruence),
  Mearsheimer (concentration vs dispersion).
  Evidence: MEM–GERMANIA–GEO–RHINE; MEM–GERMANIA–GEO–DANUBE;
  MEM–GERMANIA–GEO–BALTIC; MEM–GERMANIA–GEO–ATLANTIC;
  MEM–GERMANIA–GEO–ALPS (limit structure: reinforces depth retention by
  penalizing southward projection and corridor dilution)
  Status: BOUND

All listed RLLs are ACTIVE and BOUND.

DOCTRINE CONVERSION NOTE:
The following doctrines from v1.2 have been converted to RLLs:
• DOCTRINE v0.1 (Disciplined Restraint) → RLL–GERMANIA–0001
• DOCTRINE v0.2 (Replacement Before Expansion) → RLL–GERMANIA–0002
• DOCTRINE v0.3 (Precision Requires Closure) → RLL–GERMANIA–0003
• DOCTRINE v0.4 (Trauma-Encoded Strategic Learning) → RLL–GERMANIA–0004
• DOCTRINE v0.5 (Disciplined Restraint with Mandatory Closure) → RLL–GERMANIA–0005

CIV–DOCTRINE–GERMANIA remains authoritative for doctrine storage.
RLLs are the binding constraint mechanism within SCHOLAR operations.
