I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves **Prague** as the capital of Germania's most persistent
ideological fault line: the city where internal constraint converts into
system-destroying rupture under confessional or ideological pressure.

Prague is not merely a Bohemian capital. It is the point where the Holy
Roman Empire's internal diversity became civil war (1419), where that civil
war recurred at continental scale (1618), and where ideological fracture
again challenged imperial order (1938, 1948, 1968). The city's history
instantiates RLL–0010 (Ideological Fracture Law) across five centuries.

Unlike Budapest, which encodes constraint civilization ceiling (RLL–0007),
Prague encodes the rupture mode: what happens when constraint converts into
conflagration rather than managed impasse.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

II. MEDIEVAL PRAGUE: IMPERIAL RESIDENCE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Prague under Charles IV (r. 1346–1378) became an imperial capital.

Charles made Prague the residence of the Holy Roman Emperor and seat of
the first university in Central Europe (1348). The city's Gothic splendor—
St. Vitus Cathedral, Charles Bridge, the New Town—expressed imperial
ambition concentrated in Bohemian space.

A chronicler noted:

> "Charles raised Prague to rival Rome itself. He gathered relics, scholars,
> and artists. The city became what the Emperor wished the Empire to be:
> ordered, magnificent, and obedient to one will."
> — Beneš Krabice of Weitmile, *Chronicle*

This concentration of imperial function in Prague created the conditions
for the ideological fracture that followed. The city that housed the
Emperor also housed the university where Jan Hus would teach.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. HUSSITE PRAGUE: RUPTURE ORIGIN
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The execution of Jan Hus (1415) converted Prague into a revolutionary center.

The Hussite Wars (1419–1434) began with the First Defenestration of Prague:
Hussite crowds threw Catholic councillors from the New Town Hall windows.
The pattern—Prague as the site where ideological tension converts into
physical violence—established itself permanently.

Aeneas Silvius Piccolomini observed:

> "Prague, which had been the ornament of the Empire, became its wound.
> The heresy spread from the university into the streets, and the streets
> ran with blood. What had been a city of scholars became a city of warriors."
> — Piccolomini, *Historia Bohemica*

Five crusades failed to reduce Hussite Prague. The Wagon Fortress tactics
of Jan Žižka made the city's hinterland ungovernable. The Empire's interior
lines advantage was negated: Prague converted the center into a wound.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. 1618: RUPTURE REPEATED AT SCALE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Second Defenestration of Prague (1618) triggered the Thirty Years' War.

Protestant Bohemian nobles threw Catholic imperial officials from Prague
Castle windows. The act replayed 1419's pattern: ideological tension
converting into physical violence at a Prague window.

Peter Wilson captures the structural significance:

> "The Defenestration was not spontaneous violence. It was a calculated
> provocation by men who believed they could rally Protestant Europe
> against Habsburg universalism. They were half right: Europe rallied,
> but the war destroyed Bohemia first."
> — Peter Wilson, *The Thirty Years' War* (2009)

The war that followed consumed one-third of the German population. Prague's
rupture radiated outward, converting Germania's interior into a battlespace
for external powers. France entered in 1635; Sweden had arrived earlier.
The liability fell on the immobile German population; the gains accrued to
positioned actors who entered late and fought on others' soil.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. HABSBURG PRAGUE: ORDER WITHOUT CONSENT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
After 1620, Habsburg Prague was pacified but not reconciled.

The Battle of White Mountain (1620) ended Bohemian independence. The
Protestant nobility was dispossessed; Catholicism was reimposed; Czech
language and identity were suppressed. Prague became an administered
city under Vienna's control.

Martyn Rady notes:

> "The Habsburgs ruled Bohemia thereafter through 'bureaucratic management
> and propaganda'—an empire of imagination as much as geography. Prague
> submitted, but Prague did not forget."
> — Martyn Rady, *The Habsburgs* (2020)

The Czech National Revival of the 19th century rekindled what White
Mountain had suppressed. Prague's intellectual and cultural institutions
became centers of Czech national consciousness—a consciousness that
administrative order could contain but not eliminate.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. 1938–1948: RUPTURE UNDER TOTAL WAR
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Munich (1938) and the Communist coup (1948) repeated Prague's pattern.

Munich: The city that had been capital of Czechoslovakia was abandoned
by its Western allies. German forces occupied the Sudetenland; six months
later, Prague itself fell. Czech memory encodes this as betrayal.

A Czech official recalled:

> "We learned at Munich that alliances mean nothing when great powers
> calculate. Prague's walls would not save us; only great-power guarantee
> could, and the guarantee was withdrawn."
> — Edvard Beneš, reflections, post-1938

1948: The Communist coup converted Prague from a democratic capital into
a Soviet satellite. The pattern recurred: Prague as the site where
ideological contest determines political order, without the military
capacity to determine outcomes independently.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. 1968: PRAGUE SPRING AND SUPPRESSION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Prague Spring replayed 1848/1956 Budapest under different ideological
framing.

Dubček's reforms attempted "socialism with a human face." Soviet
intervention crushed the experiment. The structural pattern—imperial
center intervening to prevent ideological deviation—transcended the
specific regime form.

Milan Kundera wrote:

> "Prague in 1968 learned what Prague in 1620 had learned: that small
> nations exist at the sufferance of great powers, and that ideas which
> threaten imperial order will be suppressed regardless of their merit."
> — Milan Kundera, *The Book of Laughter and Forgetting* (1979)

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VIII. STRATEGIC POSITION (MEARSHEIMER ANALYSIS)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Prague's strategic significance derives from its central Bohemian position.

The Bohemian basin is a natural fortress: the Sudeten mountains, Ore
Mountains, and Bohemian-Moravian highlands create a defensive perimeter.
Prague sits at the basin's center, controlling the Vltava-Elbe river
system that connects to the North Sea.

Force-to-space calculations:
• The mountain perimeter favors defense: 2:1 to 3:1 ratios required
  for attackers at passes
• The basin interior, once penetrated, offers no secondary defensive
  positions
• Prague's control is binary: hold the perimeter and hold Prague;
  lose the perimeter and Prague falls

This geography explains why ideological fracture in Prague produces
system-wide consequences: the city's position at the Empire's geographic
center means that Prague's instability radiates outward through all
the corridors that connect Central Europe.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IX. DEFENESTRATION AS POLITICAL GRAMMAR
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Prague's defenestrations constitute a distinctive political grammar.

The act of throwing officials from windows—1419, 1618, and symbolically
threatened in 1948 (Jan Masaryk's death, officially suicide, widely
suspected as murder)—encodes a particular relationship to authority:
violent rejection that cannot sustain itself, followed by reimposition
of external order.

The defenestration grammar expresses Prague's structural position: the
city has the capacity to rupture order but not the capacity to establish
alternative order independently. Rupture invites intervention; intervention
restores order; order accumulates grievance; grievance produces rupture.

XI. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Prague encodes ideological fault line: rupture, not accommodation.
• Defenestration grammar: violent rejection → intervention → reimposition.
• Central position means rupture radiates system-wide.
• Order without consent (Habsburg, Soviet) persists but accumulates grievance.
• Small nations at great-power sufferance: ideas suppressed regardless of merit.
• Geographic fortress provides temporary protection but not independence.

Contradictions preserved without verdict.
