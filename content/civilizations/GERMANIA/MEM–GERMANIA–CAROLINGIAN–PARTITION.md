I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves the Carolingian Partition as **Germania's
origin event**: the moment when a unified Frankish empire
divided into distinct kingdoms, creating the political entities
that would become France and Germany.

The Treaty of Verdun is not remembered as an administrative
convenience.
It is remembered as **the birth of European nation-states**—the
division that established the fundamental political geography
of Western Europe for twelve centuries.

For Germania, the partition represents both emergence and loss.
East Francia gained identity as a distinct realm; yet the Middle
Kingdom—Lotharingia—became the contested zone that would fuel
Franco-German conflict until the twentieth century.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

II. THE CAROLINGIAN EMPIRE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The partition divided Charlemagne's creation:

CHARLEMAGNE'S ACHIEVEMENT:
Charlemagne (r. 768–814) united the Frankish kingdoms, conquered
the Lombards, subdued the Saxons, and received imperial coronation
(800). His empire stretched from the Pyrenees to the Elbe, from
the North Sea to central Italy.

> "Charlemagne's empire was the largest Western European political
> unit since Rome. It encompassed multiple peoples, languages, and
> traditions under a single ruler claiming Roman imperial succession.
> The unity was personal, not institutional—it depended on Charlemagne."
> — Rosamond McKitterick, *Charlemagne* (2008), p. 312
> [ERC: SECONDARY]

LOUIS THE PIOUS:
Charlemagne's son Louis (r. 814–840) maintained unity with difficulty.
His reign saw repeated civil wars among his sons. The Ordinatio
Imperii (817) attempted to establish succession; subsequent revisions
provoked rebellion.

CIVIL WAR:
Louis's sons—Lothar, Louis the German, and Charles the Bald—fought
for supremacy. The Battle of Fontenoy (841) killed perhaps 40,000
Franks. The empire bled from internal conflict.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. THE STRASBOURG OATHS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Before Verdun came linguistic division:

ALLIANCE (842):
Louis the German and Charles the Bald allied against their brother
Lothar. To seal the alliance, each swore oaths in the other's
language—so their followers could understand.

LINGUISTIC RECORD:
The Strasbourg Oaths constitute the earliest written texts in
distinct Romance (Old French) and Germanic (Old High German)
languages. The languages that would define France and Germany
were already diverging.

> "The Strasbourg Oaths mark the moment when Frankish unity
> became linguistically impossible. Louis swore in Romance;
> Charles swore in Germanic. Their followers could no longer
> understand each other's language. The empire had become
> two peoples."
> — Johannes Fried, *The Middle Ages* (2015), p. 89
> [ERC: SECONDARY]

POLITICAL SIGNIFICANCE:
The oaths demonstrated that East and West Francia were becoming
distinct cultural zones. Language preceded politics; the partition
ratified what speech had already accomplished.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. THE TREATY OF VERDUN (843)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The treaty divided the empire:

NEGOTIATION:
After defeating Lothar at Fontenoy (841), the brothers negotiated
at Verdun. The empire was surveyed and divided according to
resources rather than ethnic or linguistic lines.

DIVISION:
• **West Francia** (Charles the Bald): Territory roughly
  corresponding to modern France—lands west of the Scheldt,
  Meuse, Saône, and Rhône rivers
• **East Francia** (Louis the German): Territory east of the
  Rhine and north of the Alps—the future German kingdom
• **Middle Kingdom** (Lothar I): A strip from the North Sea
  to Italy, including Lotharingia, Burgundy, Provence, and
  the Lombard kingdom; plus the imperial title

> "The Treaty of Verdun created Europe's political geography.
> The tripartite division established West Francia (France),
> East Francia (Germany), and a Middle Kingdom that would
> become the battleground between them. The lines drawn in
> 843 structured European conflict for a millennium."
> — Peter H. Wilson, *Heart of Europe* (2016), p. 87
> [ERC: SECONDARY]

IMPERIAL TITLE:
Lothar retained the imperial title, but it became increasingly
nominal. The title passed through his line until extinction,
then to various claimants, before Otto I's coronation (962)
established the German-imperial connection.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. THE MIDDLE KINGDOM PROBLEM
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Lothar's inheritance created structural instability:

ARTIFICIAL CONSTRUCTION:
The Middle Kingdom was not a coherent unit. It stretched from
Frisia to Rome, encompassing diverse territories united only
by Lothar's claim. It lacked ethnic, linguistic, or geographic
coherence.

SUBDIVISION:
Lothar's death (855) divided the Middle Kingdom among his three
sons: Louis II (Italy), Lothar II (Lotharingia), Charles
(Provence). Further fragmentation followed.

> "The Middle Kingdom was a geographic absurdity—a strip of
> territory drawn to give Lothar a realm matching his brothers'.
> It could not survive as a unit. Its components—Italy, Burgundy,
> Lotharingia—had no common interest beyond their ruler's person."
> — Johannes Fried, *The Middle Ages* (2015), p. 94
> [ERC: SECONDARY]

CONTESTED ZONE:
As the Middle Kingdom fragmented, its components became prizes
for East and West Francia. Lotharingia, Burgundy, and Provence
were absorbed, contested, and reconstituted repeatedly.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. EAST FRANCIA EMERGES
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The partition created the German kingdom:

LOUIS THE GERMAN (r. 843–876):
Louis established East Francia as a distinct realm. His kingdom
encompassed Saxony, Franconia, Bavaria, Swabia, and Thuringia—
the tribal duchies that would define medieval Germany.

CAROLINGIAN CONTINUATION:
Louis's descendants ruled East Francia until 911 (death of Louis
the Child). The Carolingian dynasty thus lasted longer in the
east than in the west, where it ended in 987.

> "East Francia under Louis the German became Germany in embryo.
> The tribal duchies—Saxon, Franconian, Bavarian, Swabian—
> retained identity within the kingdom. German unity would
> always be a federation of these regional powers."
> — Peter H. Wilson, *Heart of Europe* (2016), p. 92
> [ERC: SECONDARY]

OTTONIAN SUCCESSION:
When the Carolingian line failed (911), East Frankish magnates
elected first Conrad of Franconia, then Henry of Saxony. The
Ottonian dynasty (919–1024) transformed East Francia into the
German kingdom and restored imperial claims.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. LONG-TERM CONSEQUENCES
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The partition structured European history:

FRANCO-GERMAN RIVALRY:
The division created two powers of comparable strength competing
for the territories between them. The Middle Kingdom's fragments—
Lorraine, Alsace, Burgundy, the Rhineland—became perpetual
battlegrounds.

IMPERIAL TRADITION:
The German kingdom inherited imperial claims through Otto I's
coronation (962). German rulers pursued Roman titles, entangling
Germany in Italian affairs for centuries.

FEDERAL STRUCTURE:
East Francia's tribal duchies preserved regional identity within
the kingdom. German political development followed federal rather
than centralized patterns—a consequence of the partition's
recognition of regional diversity.

> "The Treaty of Verdun established that Germany would be a
> collection of regions rather than a unified kingdom. The
> tribal duchies preserved under Louis the German never fully
> merged. German history became the history of their interaction
> rather than their absorption."
> — Rosamond McKitterick, *Charlemagne* (2008), p. 348
> [ERC: SECONDARY]

TERRITORIAL INSTABILITY:
The boundary between East and West Francia—never based on
ethnic or linguistic lines—remained contested. The Rhine was
a river through German territory, not a boundary around it.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VIII. HISTORIOGRAPHICAL SIGNIFICANCE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The partition acquired retrospective meaning:

NATIONAL ORIGINS:
Nineteenth-century nationalism identified Verdun as the birth
of France and Germany. The treaty acquired foundational status
it may not have held for contemporaries.

MEDIEVAL UNDERSTANDING:
Contemporaries may have viewed the partition as temporary—
another Frankish division to be reversed. The permanence
emerged gradually.

> "Whether the men at Verdun knew they were creating France
> and Germany remains debatable. They divided an empire among
> brothers, as Franks had done before. That this division
> proved permanent—that the brothers' kingdoms became nations—
> was not foreordained."
> — Johannes Fried, *The Middle Ages* (2015), p. 97
> [ERC: SECONDARY]

STRUCTURAL INTERPRETATION:
The partition reflected linguistic and cultural divergence
already underway. Language, law, and custom had differentiated
the Frankish world; Verdun ratified the differentiation.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IX. DOCTRINAL IMPLICATIONS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The partition instantiates the ORIGIN DIVISION pattern:

PATTERN: A unified polity divides into successor states that
compete for the original's legacy and territory. The division
creates permanent rivalry; the contested zone becomes the
battlefield; resolution requires either reunification or
institutional transformation.

APPLICABLE DOCTRINES:
• DOCTRINE 01: Competence-Derived Legitimacy — East Frankish
  rulers derived legitimacy from Carolingian succession, later
  from imperial coronation
• DOCTRINE 06: Corridor Depth Over Dispersed Reach — Lotharingia
  represented the corridor; its control determined Franco-German
  power balance

RLL CONNECTION:
• RLL–GERMANIA–0001 (Land Power Constraint): The partition
  created Germany as a land power with exposed frontiers
• RLL–GERMANIA–0007 (Western Frontier Anxiety): The undefined
  western boundary generated permanent security concerns
