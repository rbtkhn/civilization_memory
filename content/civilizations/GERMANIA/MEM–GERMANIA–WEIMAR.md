I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves the Weimar Republic as **Germania's democratic
interval**: the constitutional experiment that emerged from imperial
collapse, survived hyperinflation, stabilized briefly, and succumbed
to depression, polarization, and totalitarian capture.

Weimar is not remembered as a failed democracy.
It is remembered as **a regime whose institutional weaknesses
preceded its birth**—the inheritor of Wilhelmine structural defects
that made stabilization possible but not probable.

For Germania, Weimar encodes the lesson that constitutional form
without institutional foundation produces vulnerability. The Republic
possessed democratic legitimacy; it lacked the fiscal and monetary
institutions to defend itself.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

II. REVOLUTIONARY ORIGINS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Republic emerges from imperial collapse:

NOVEMBER REVOLUTION (1918):
Military defeat triggers political revolution. Wilhelm II abdicates;
the Social Democrats proclaim a republic; competing socialist
factions contest power.

CONSTITUTIONAL ASSEMBLY:
The National Assembly meets at Weimar (avoiding revolutionary
Berlin) and drafts a democratic constitution. The Weimar
Constitution (1919) establishes universal suffrage, proportional
representation, and a strong presidency.

> "The Weimar Republic was born in defeat and revolution—two
> conditions that guaranteed it would be blamed for both. The
> 'November criminals' became the scapegoat for those who could
> not accept that Germany had been defeated militarily."
> — Ian Kershaw, *Hitler: 1889–1936 Hubris* (1998)
> [ERC: SECONDARY]

The Republic inherits defeat; it is blamed for causing it.

SETTLEMENT-DESIGN INHERITANCE:
Weimar was born from a peace that **excluded** Germany from the table—
no Talleyrand equivalent, no inclusion of the defeated as stakeholder.
The Treaty of Versailles imposed war guilt, reparations, and territorial
loss without giving Germany a voice in designing the settlement or a
narrative that made acceptance honorable. The "November criminals"
bore domestic liability for a peace unnarratable as legitimate—the
inverse of the Vienna principle (bind the defeated by including them).

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. WILHELMINE INSTITUTIONAL INHERITANCE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Weimar's weakness preceded its constitution:

Niall Ferguson's analysis identifies structural defects dating
to Bismarck's Reich:

> "The central Reichsbank of the Wilhelmine era had relatively
> little power compared to the large private discount banks to
> dictate monetary reserves or control the supply of money in
> the German economy."
> — Niall Ferguson, *Paper and Iron* (1995)
> [ERC: SECONDARY]

INSTITUTIONAL DEFECTS:
• Weak central bank unable to control money supply
• Fragmented fiscal authority (Reich, Länder, Communes)
• Limited tax capacity relative to expenditure demands
• Private sector dominance over monetary policy
• Interest groups able to manipulate fiscal decisions

Ferguson's core insight:

> "The frail structure of the new Reich's monetary and fiscal
> institutions compared to powerful regional and industrial
> sectors created a set of conditions that made an inflationary
> trend in German economy almost certain from the outset."
> — Niall Ferguson, *Paper and Iron* (1995)
> [ERC: SECONDARY]

Weimar did not create these weaknesses; it inherited them.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. VERSAILLES AND REPARATIONS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Treaty of Versailles imposed constraints:

TREATY TERMS:
• Territorial losses (Alsace-Lorraine, Polish Corridor, colonies)
• Military limitations (100,000-man army, no air force)
• War guilt clause (Article 231)
• Reparations obligations (ultimately 132 billion gold marks)

DOMESTIC POLITICS:
Reparations became the central political issue. All parties
rejected the treaty; debate focused on compliance versus
resistance.

> "The Weimar Republic could never escape Versailles. Every
> domestic crisis became a reparations crisis; every economic
> difficulty was attributed to foreign extraction. The treaty
> delegitimized the regime that signed it."
> — Christopher Clark, *Iron Kingdom* (2006)
> [ERC: SECONDARY]

The Republic was blamed for accepting terms it could not refuse.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. THE HYPERINFLATION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The 1923 hyperinflation was the Republic's defining trauma:

MECHANISM:
War debt financed by money creation; post-war deficits
continued the pattern; Ruhr occupation (1923) triggered
final collapse. The mark fell from 4.2 per dollar (1914)
to 4.2 trillion per dollar (November 1923).

Ferguson challenges the revisionist view that inflation
was beneficial:

> "It was inflation which led from Wilhelmine grandeur to
> Weimar collapse."
> — Niall Ferguson, *Paper and Iron* (1995), p. 408
> [ERC: SECONDARY]

CONSEQUENCES:
• Middle-class savings destroyed
• Creditor class wiped out
• Social trust eroded
• Debtors (including the state) relieved of obligations
• Moral economy of thrift delegitimized

HAMBURG PERSPECTIVE:
Wilhelm Cuno, Director of the Hamburg-Amerika shipping line
(HAPAG), became Chancellor in 1922. His policy of passive
resistance to the Ruhr occupation—financed by printing money—
accelerated the final collapse.

> "Ferguson calls this 'politics by businessmen'—commercial
> logic misapplied to statecraft. Cuno's Hamburg background
> shaped policies that destroyed the currency."
> — Niall Ferguson, *Paper and Iron* (1995)
> [ERC: SECONDARY]

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. STABILIZATION AND GOLDEN YEARS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Brief recovery followed catastrophe:

STABILIZATION (1923–1924):
The Rentenmark (November 1923) and Dawes Plan (1924) ended
hyperinflation. American loans financed German recovery;
reparations were restructured.

GOLDEN YEARS (1924–1929):
Economic growth, cultural flourishing, political moderation.
Stresemann's diplomacy achieved Locarno (1925) and League
membership (1926).

Yet Ferguson notes the counterfactual:

> "Alternative economic policies could have stabilized the
> German currency in 1920. The inflation was not inevitable;
> it was chosen."
> — Niall Ferguson, *Paper and Iron* (1995)
> [ERC: SECONDARY]

Stabilization proved fragile because it depended on American
capital flows that could—and would—reverse.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. DEPRESSION AND COLLAPSE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Great Depression destroyed Weimar's stability:

ECONOMIC COLLAPSE:
American loans recalled; German banks failed; unemployment
reached 30%; industrial production collapsed.

POLITICAL POLARIZATION:
Communists and Nazis gained at moderate parties' expense.
Presidential government replaced parliamentary coalition.
Brüning's austerity deepened the crisis.

> "The Weimar Republic did not fall to a Nazi majority. It
> was handed to Hitler by conservative elites who believed
> they could control him. They were catastrophically wrong."
> — Ian Kershaw, *Hitler: 1889–1936 Hubris* (1998)
> [ERC: SECONDARY]

The Republic was not overthrown; it was surrendered.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VIII. INSTITUTIONAL FAILURE ANALYSIS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Ferguson's institutional analysis explains why Weimar failed
where other democracies survived:

CONTINUITY THESIS:
The institutional defects that produced Wilhelmine inflation
persisted through 1918 into the Republic. Weak central banking,
fragmented fiscal authority, and interest-group capture prevented
effective stabilization policy.

COUNTERFACTUAL:
If the Reich had possessed stronger fiscal and monetary
institutions, stabilization in 1920 was possible. The inflation
need not have become hyperinflation; the middle class need not
have been destroyed; the Republic need not have been delegitimized.

> "Ferguson poses the question why economic interest groups in
> Germany were so easily able to manipulate monetary and fiscal
> policies... He finds the answer in the weak economic and
> monetary institutions set in place in Bismarck's Reich."
> — J. Ronald Shearer, H-Net Review of *Paper and Iron* (1996)
> [ERC: CRITICAL]

The roots of Weimar's failure lie in Wilhelmine institutional
design—or rather, in institutional weakness.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IX. DOCTRINAL IMPLICATIONS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Weimar instantiates the INSTITUTIONAL INHERITANCE pattern:

PATTERN: A new regime inherits institutional structures from
its predecessor. Constitutional change cannot overcome structural
weakness; form cannot substitute for foundation; democratic
legitimacy cannot compensate for fiscal incapacity.

APPLICABLE DOCTRINES:
• DOCTRINE 01: Competence-Derived Legitimacy — Weimar lacked
  competence in monetary/fiscal domains; legitimacy followed
• DOCTRINE 03: Legal Formalism — Constitutional formalism
  could not overcome structural weakness

RLL CONNECTION:
• RLL–GERMANIA–0011 (Institutional Inheritance Law): New regimes
  inherit predecessor structural defects unless explicitly reformed
