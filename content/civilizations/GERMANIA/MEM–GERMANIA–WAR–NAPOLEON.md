I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves the Napoleonic Wars as **Germania's civilizational
near-death experience and subsequent reconstruction**: the generation
in which the Holy Roman Empire dissolved, German states became French
satellites, and the trauma of occupation produced the reforms that
enabled liberation.

For Germania, the Napoleonic period is not merely military history.
It is **existential crisis encoding permanent constraint**.

The sequence demonstrates SYNTHESIS 0020 (Imperial Collapse Mechanics)
operating against Germania itself, followed by Germania's participation
in the defection cascade that destroyed Napoleonic hegemony.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. REVOLUTIONARY WAR SHOCK (1792–1797)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Revolutionary France attacks a complacent imperial structure.

The Holy Roman Empire enters war unprepared:
• Coalition warfare without coordination
• Dynastic objectives divorced from strategic coherence
• Underestimation of revolutionary mobilization capacity
• Prussian withdrawal (Peace of Basel, 1795)

Peter Wilson observes the structural fragility:

> "The Empire's military structure had atrophied since 1763. The
> Reichsarmee was a paper army; the kreise could not coordinate;
> Austria and Prussia pursued separate wars while calling them
> imperial. The French, mobilizing the nation, faced a constitutional
> fiction."
> — Peter Wilson, *Heart of Europe: A History of the Holy Roman
>   Empire* (2016)

The First Coalition demonstrates that Germania's distributed legitimacy
(RLL–0008) cannot produce concentrated force.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. IMPERIAL DISSOLUTION (1806)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Holy Roman Empire ceases to exist.

Sequence:
• Austerlitz (December 1805): Habsburg military power broken
• Confederation of the Rhine (July 1806): German princes defect
• Francis II abdicates (August 1806): Imperial title surrendered
• 962–1806: A thousand years conclude in administrative act

The dissolution validates SYNTHESIS 0020's Phase 2 (Liability Cascade):
German princes calculated that Napoleonic protection exceeded Habsburg
value, and legitimacy destination (Confederation membership with
territorial gains) enabled defection.

Heinrich Heine, writing decades later, captured the melancholy:

> "The Holy Roman Empire—it was neither holy, nor Roman, nor an
> empire—but it was old, very old, like an ancient grandmother
> whose death grieved us even when we could not remember her youth."
> — Heinrich Heine, *The Romantic School* (1833)

Those who defected first (Bavaria, Württemberg, Baden) extracted
maximum territorial gains. Those who resisted (Prussia) absorbed
maximum destruction.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. PRUSSIAN CATASTROPHE AND REFORM (1806–1812)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Prussia's destruction becomes Germania's reform laboratory.

The collapse:
• Jena-Auerstedt (October 1806): Prussian army annihilated in a day
• Berlin occupied; Frederick the Great's sword taken to Paris
• Treaty of Tilsit (1807): Prussia reduced to rump state
• War indemnity, occupation, territorial amputation

Scharnhorst diagnosed the structural failure:

> "We were beaten not because our soldiers lacked courage but
> because our system lacked the capacity to regenerate. The
> French replaced losses faster than we could count ours. Their
> nation made war; our dynasty played at war."
> — Gerhard von Scharnhorst, *Memorandum on Military Reform* (1807)

The reform program:
• Scharnhorst/Gneisenau: Military reorganization, citizen army concept
• Stein/Hardenberg: Administrative reform, peasant emancipation
• Humboldt: Educational reform, University of Berlin (1810)
• Krümpersystem: Circumventing French troop limits through rotation

Trauma encodes permanent constraint: Prussia learns that system
regeneration, not dynastic prestige, determines survival.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. GERMAN CONTINGENT IN GRANDE ARMÉE (1812)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Germania provides substantial forces for Napoleon's Russian campaign.

Composition:
• Prussian auxiliary corps (~20,000 under Yorck)
• Austrian auxiliary corps (~30,000 under Schwarzenberg)
• Bavarian, Saxon, Westphalian, Württemberg contingents
• German troops constitute perhaps 30% of Grande Armée

The German contingents face the arithmetic that destroys Napoleon
(SYNTHESIS 0020, Phase 1): 600,000 men enter Russia; fewer than
100,000 combat-effective troops return.

Carl von Clausewitz, serving in Russian uniform after refusing to
fight for Napoleon, analyzed the structural impossibility:

> "Napoleon erred not in his calculations but in his premise.
> He assumed that capturing Moscow would end the war because
> that is how European wars ended. But Russia was not Europe,
> and Alexander was not Louis. The war continued because Russia
> could absorb losses Napoleon could not replace."
> — Carl von Clausewitz, *The Campaign of 1812 in Russia* (1843)

German forces absorb casualties without strategic voice.
Liability falls on the immobile; gain accrues to those who reposition.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. DEFECTION CASCADE: YORCK AT TAUROGGEN
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Prussian defection triggers the cascade that destroys Napoleonic
hegemony in Germany.

The Convention of Tauroggen (December 30, 1812):
• General Yorck, commanding Prussian corps in Grande Armée
• Unauthorized negotiation with Russian commander Diebitsch
• Prussian neutrality declared without Berlin's authorization
• First visible crack in Napoleonic German system

Yorck's justification exemplifies SYNTHESIS 0020's Phase 3 (Legitimacy
Reframing)—defection requires narrative transforming treason into duty:

> "I am aware that I am putting my head at stake by this action.
> But a true man knows no other course than that of duty. The
> King's uniform demands that I act for Prussia, even when the
> King cannot command."
> — Johann David Ludwig von Yorck, letter (December 1812)

The cascade accelerates:
• Prussia exits French alliance (Treaty of Kalisch, February 1813)
• Russia advances into Germany
• Austria shifts to armed neutrality, then opposition
• Bavaria, Saxony begin repositioning calculations
• Each defection validates the next

Barnes's liability analysis applies: Yorck defected because personal
and institutional interests diverged from Napoleonic system while
legitimacy destination (Russian alliance, Prussian patriotism)
became available.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. WARS OF LIBERATION (1813–1814)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Germania fights to expel the system it had served.

Campaign of 1813:
• Spring: Lützen, Bautzen—Napoleon wins tactically, cannot close
• Armistice (June-August): Austria joins coalition
• Leipzig (October): "Battle of Nations"—decisive coalition victory
• French retreat across Rhine

Leopold von Ranke characterized the transformation:

> "The Wars of Liberation represent not merely territorial recovery
> but civilizational self-recognition. Germans fought in 1813 as
> Germans had not fought since the Reformation—with a sense that
> something beyond dynasty was at stake."
> — Leopold von Ranke, *History of the Germanic Peoples* (1824)

The campaign validates coalition endurance over individual genius
(confirming RLL–0003's inverse: precision without coalition fails).

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VIII. CONGRESS OF VIENNA: CLOSURE THROUGH INCLUSION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The settlement demonstrates SYNTHESIS 0021's Path A (Inclusion).

Settlement design:
• France included as great power (Talleyrand at table)
• No regime-delegitimization of defeated France
• Bourbon restoration provides continuity narrative
• Territorial adjustment without civilizational humiliation
• Balance-of-power architecture, not punitive extraction

The German settlement:
• German Confederation replaces Holy Roman Empire
• 39 states under Austrian presidency
• No unified German state; distributed sovereignty preserved
• Prussia gains Rhineland, Westphalia—western concentration

Metternich articulated the restraint principle:

> "The first and greatest requirement is the maintenance of
> equilibrium and stability. A shattered France would produce
> convulsions worse than Napoleon. We bind France to the system
> by giving France stake in the system."
> — Klemens von Metternich, *Memoirs* (c. 1820)

Vienna succeeds where Versailles will fail because all parties,
including France, have stake in maintaining the settlement.
This is closure capacity alignment: incentive, power, legitimacy.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IX. TRAUMA ENCODING AND STRATEGIC CULTURE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Napoleonic experience encodes permanent constraints.

Lessons absorbed:
• Distributed legitimacy cannot produce concentrated force (Empire failure)
• System regeneration capacity determines survival (Prussian reform)
• Defection cascades destroy hegemonic systems (1812–1813 sequence)
• Coalition endurance defeats individual brilliance (Leipzig)
• Settlement through inclusion produces stability (Vienna)

The reforms persist:
• Conscription system (Krümpersystem → general military obligation)
• Staff system (Scharnhorst → Prussian General Staff)
• Educational system (Humboldt → research university model)
• Administrative capacity (Stein-Hardenberg → bureaucratic state)

The trauma also produces dangerous lessons:
• National mobilization as war-winning formula (misapplied 1914)
• Reform-through-crisis as model (risk-seeking behavior)
• Staff system as substitute for political judgment (1914 rigidity)

Johann Gottlieb Fichte's wartime lectures captured the nationalist
mobilization that would later prove double-edged:

> "The German nation is the only one capable of the highest form
> of cultivation and therefore has the highest calling among the
> nations. If Germany falls, humanity falls with it."
> — Johann Gottlieb Fichte, *Addresses to the German Nation* (1808)

Tension preserved: the same trauma that encoded restraint also
encoded nationalist mobilization—producing both Bismarck's stopping
rules and Wilhelm's escalation.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
X. CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Napoleonic period encodes core Germanic axioms:

• Discipline defeats genius (Waterloo)
• System regeneration matters more than initial capability (Prussian reform)
• Coalition coherence defeats hegemonic ambition (Leipzig)
• Defection cascades destroy overextended systems (Tauroggen)
• Settlement through inclusion produces stable closure (Vienna)
• Trauma encodes constraint, but also dangerous lessons

This memory feeds the subsequent century:
• Bismarckian restraint applies Napoleon-lessons correctly
• Wilhelmine escalation misapplies Napoleon-lessons catastrophically
• The divergence determines whether precision produces closure or catastrophe

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
XI. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Imperial structures fail when coordination capacity cannot match challenge
• Defection cascades require arithmetic visibility AND legitimacy destination
• Trauma can encode both restraint (Bismarck) and mobilization (1914)
• Reform under crisis produces institutional capacity
• Coalition persistence matters more than battlefield brilliance
• Settlement design determines whether closure holds
• The same lessons misread produce opposite outcomes

Tension preserved without verdict.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
XIII. MEARSHEIMER STRATEGIC ASSESSMENT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Force-ratio analysis:

PHASE 1 (1792–1806): Coalition arithmetic favored France.
• French mobilization capacity exceeded coalition coordination capacity
• Revolutionary/Napoleonic army regenerated faster than allied losses replaced
• Interior lines enabled concentration; coalition operated on exterior lines
• Culmination: Austerlitz arithmetic (73,000 French vs. 85,000 Austro-Russian)
  produced decisive tactical victory through concentration superiority

PHASE 2 (1812–1813): Arithmetic inverted through overextension.
• Russian campaign consumed Grande Armée replacement capacity
• 600,000 → ~100,000 effective = arithmetic collapse
• Coalition forces regenerated while French forces degraded
• Leipzig arithmetic: ~190,000 French vs. ~330,000 coalition = structural defeat

PHASE 3 (1813–1814): Coalition coordination finally exceeded French regeneration.
• Each German state defecting reduced French force pool, increased coalition pool
• Defection cascade = power transfer mechanism
• France could not replace losses faster than coalition accumulated

Structural verdict: Napoleon lost when arithmetic inverted—when coalition
replacement capacity exceeded French replacement capacity. This occurred
through overextension (Russia) and defection cascade (Germany).

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
XIV. BARNES LIABILITY ASSESSMENT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Who paid and who collected:

PHASE 1 (French dominance):
• German princes paid (territorial losses, indemnities)
• German peasants paid (conscription, war requisitions)
• German commercial interests paid (Continental System disruption)
• Napoleon's marshals collected (German territories as personal domains)
• Collaborating princes collected (territorial expansion: Bavaria, Baden)

PHASE 2 (Campaign of 1812):
• German contingent soldiers paid (casualties in Russia without voice)
• Napoleon paid (strategic position, military reputation)
• Russian population paid (scorched earth, occupation, Moscow burning)
• Russia collected (legitimacy, strategic victory, European position)
• Yorck collected (reputation transformed from traitor-risk to patriot)

PHASE 3 (Liberation and Settlement):
• French population paid (invasion, occupation costs)
• Napoleon paid (exile, dynasty termination)
• Prussian reformers collected (institutional position, vindication)
• Austrian/Prussian/Russian crowns collected (territorial adjustment, legitimacy)
• German nationalists collected (narrative vindication, partial)
• German princes who defected early collected (retained territorial gains)

LIABILITY CHAIN: Those who repositioned earliest preserved most.
Saxony, which repositioned last (Leipzig), lost half its territory.
Bavaria, which repositioned early (Treaty of Ried), retained gains.
