I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves Frederick William as **Prussia's founder in
all but name**: the ruler who transformed a scattered, devastated,
and insignificant electorate into the disciplined administrative-
military state that his descendants would convert into a great power.

For Germania, Frederick William represents **construction from
catastrophe**. He inherited lands devastated by the Thirty Years'
War, surrounded by stronger powers, without natural defenses or
resources. From this unpromising base, he built the institutions—
standing army, centralized taxation, professional bureaucracy—
that made Prussian power possible.

Christopher Clark captures the foundational significance:

> "Frederick William was the first Hohenzollern to think of his
> scattered territories as a single state requiring unified
> administration. Before him, Brandenburg, Prussia, and Cleves
> were dynastic possessions. After him, they were Prussia."
> — Christopher Clark, *Iron Kingdom* (2006)
> [ERC: SECONDARY]

Without Frederick William, there is no Frederick the Great, no
Bismarck, no unified Germany. He is the **point of origin**.

This file records the Great Elector as the **state-builder from
ruins**: demonstrating how institutional innovation under extreme
constraint can create power where none existed.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

II. INHERITANCE: CATASTROPHE AND FRAGMENTS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Frederick William inherits disaster.

When he became Elector of Brandenburg in 1640, the Thirty Years'
War had devastated his lands:
• Brandenburg's population reduced by perhaps 50%
• Agricultural production collapsed
• Towns burned or abandoned
• The army barely existed (a few thousand unreliable troops)
• Foreign armies (Swedish, Imperial) occupied his territories

The territories themselves were fragmented:
• **Brandenburg**: the electoral core, around Berlin
• **Ducal Prussia**: far to the east, a Polish fief
• **Cleves-Mark**: far to the west, on the Rhine
• **Pomerania**: contested with Sweden

No natural unity connected these lands. Only dynastic accident
made them one ruler's responsibility.

Peter Wilson describes the strategic situation:

> "Brandenburg-Prussia in 1640 was a minor German principality
> with pretensions and no means to fulfill them. Its territories
> were scattered, poor, and occupied by foreign troops."
> — Peter H. Wilson, *Heart of Europe* (2016)
> [ERC: SECONDARY]

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. SURVIVAL THROUGH THE THIRTY YEARS' WAR (1640–1648)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Frederick William's first task: extract Brandenburg from the war.

He inherited during the war's final phase but could not simply
withdraw. Swedish forces occupied Pomerania; Imperial forces
demanded passage; Brandenburg was a battleground for others.

Frederick William's approach: tactical neutrality combined with
gradual military buildup. He avoided commitment while creating
the force that would make commitment meaningful.

By 1648, he had assembled approximately 8,000 soldiers—small by
great-power standards, but enough to matter at the peace table.

The Peace of Westphalia (1648) delivered partial success:
• Eastern Pomerania acquired (western Pomerania to Sweden)
• Several secularized bishoprics gained
• Territorial consolidation begun

Frederick William reportedly observed:

> "Alliances are good, but one's own forces are better. They can
> be relied upon with more certainty."
> — Frederick William, attributed (various sources)
> [ERC: CONTEXTUAL]

This became the Hohenzollern maxim: power through self-reliance.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. BUILDING THE STANDING ARMY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Frederick William's central achievement: the permanent army.

Before him, German princes raised troops for specific campaigns
and disbanded them afterward. Frederick William maintained a
standing force regardless of peace or war.

The numbers tell the story:
• 1640: ~4,500 troops (unreliable)
• 1655: ~22,000 troops
• 1678: ~45,000 troops
• 1688: ~30,000 troops (reduced after wars)

Tim Blanning emphasizes the institutional significance:

> "Frederick William understood that a standing army was not merely
> a military instrument but a state-building tool. It required
> permanent taxation, professional administration, and centralized
> command—exactly what he sought to create."
> — Tim Blanning, *Frederick the Great: King of Prussia* (2015)
> [ERC: SECONDARY]

The army became the spine of the Prussian state.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. FISCAL INNOVATION: THE KONTRIBUTION AND EXCISE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Armies require money. Frederick William revolutionizes taxation.

The traditional system depended on estates voting taxes—a slow,
uncertain process that gave nobles leverage over princes. Frederick
William bypassed it.

His innovations:
• **Kontribution**: permanent military tax on rural areas,
  collected directly by royal commissars, bypassing estates
• **Excise (Akzise)**: urban consumption tax, also royally administered
• **War commissariat**: unified military-fiscal administration

The estates resisted. Frederick William prevailed through patience,
pressure, and the argument that security required sacrifice.

A contemporary observer noted:

> "The Elector treats his territories as a military encampment,
> where all must contribute to the common defense according to
> their capacity, not their privilege."
> — Contemporary diplomatic report (c. 1670)
> [ERC: CONTEXTUAL]

By his death, taxation was permanent, centralized, and sufficient
to maintain the army without annual negotiation.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. THE WARS: BUILDING REPUTATION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Frederick William fights to prove Brandenburg-Prussia matters.

**First Northern War (1655–1660)**:
Frederick William switches sides repeatedly—from Sweden to Poland
to Sweden to anti-Swedish coalition—extracting maximum advantage.
Result: full sovereignty over Ducal Prussia (no longer a Polish fief).

**Franco-Dutch War (1672–1678)**:
Initially allied with France, Frederick William switches to the
Dutch-Imperial coalition when Louis XIV's ambitions threaten
German interests.

**Battle of Fehrbellin (1675)**:
The defining victory. Swedish forces invading Brandenburg are
defeated by Frederick William's cavalry at Fehrbellin (June 28,
1675). The victory is modest in scale but immense in significance.

Clark describes the transformation:

> "Fehrbellin transformed Brandenburg's reputation. A minor German
> principality had defeated the feared Swedish army. Frederick
> William became 'the Great Elector' and Brandenburg-Prussia became
> a power to be reckoned with."
> — Christopher Clark, *Iron Kingdom* (2006)
> [ERC: SECONDARY]

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. ADMINISTRATION AND CENTRALIZATION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Frederick William builds the bureaucratic state.

His administrative innovations:
• **Privy Council (Geheimer Rat)**: central advisory body
• **War Commissariat (Generalkriegskommissariat)**: military-fiscal
  administration that became the core of Prussian bureaucracy
• **Domain administration**: systematic management of royal lands
• **Postal system**: state monopoly providing revenue and communication

The goal: unified administration across scattered territories.

Frederick William instructed his officials:

> "You are not servants of the estates or the localities, but of
> the state and its sovereign. Your loyalty is to the whole, not
> the part."
> — Frederick William, administrative ordinance (paraphrase)
> [ERC: CONTEXTUAL]

This principle—state above locality, service above privilege—
became the Prussian administrative ethos.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VIII. RELIGIOUS TOLERANCE AND THE HUGUENOT INVITATION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Frederick William practices tolerance for practical reasons.

A Calvinist ruling Lutheran subjects in Brandenburg and Catholic
subjects elsewhere, Frederick William could not afford religious
persecution. He protected religious minorities—not from principle
but from interest.

The **Edict of Potsdam** (1685) invited French Huguenots fleeing
Louis XIV's persecution:

> "We hereby make known that we shall receive with open arms all
> of the Reformed religion who wish to settle in our lands...
> granting them all privileges and advantages."
> — Edict of Potsdam (October 29, 1685)
> [ERC: PRIMARY]

Approximately 20,000 Huguenots settled in Brandenburg-Prussia,
bringing skills, capital, and industry. Berlin's population grew;
manufactures expanded; the state gained capable subjects.

Tolerance as state-building instrument.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IX. SUCCESSION AND LEGACY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Frederick William dies having created what his heirs would inherit.

His **Political Testament** (1667, updated) instructs his successor:

> "A ruler must above all maintain a strong army, for without it
> he cannot preserve his territories or gain the respect of his
> neighbors. But an army requires money, and money requires good
> administration. Therefore attend to your finances and your
> officials as carefully as to your troops."
> — Frederick William, *Political Testament*
> [ERC: PRIMARY]

His son Frederick III would become Frederick I, first King in
Prussia (1701). His great-grandson Frederick II would become
Frederick the Great. Each built on what Frederick William created.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
X. STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Frederick William's reign encodes recurring Germanic patterns:

**Mearsheimer frame**: Brandenburg-Prussia faces the classic
weak-state dilemma—surrounded by stronger powers (Sweden, Poland,
Austria, France), lacking natural defenses, with scattered
territories inviting partition. Frederick William's solution:
internal consolidation (army + taxation + administration) creating
deterrent capacity. The goal is not conquest but survival through
demonstrated capability.

**Barnes frame**: Who paid for Frederick William's state-building?
The peasantry bore the Kontribution; urban dwellers bore the
Excise; the nobility lost some fiscal privileges but gained
confirmation of their social dominance (serfdom, officer positions).
Huguenot refugees paid through displacement but gained security.
The beneficiaries: the Hohenzollern dynasty and the bureaucratic-
military class that served it.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
XI. CIVILIZATIONAL LEGACY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Frederick William's achievement: making Prussia possible.

Key legacies:
• The standing army as permanent institution
• Centralized taxation bypassing estates
• Professional bureaucracy as governance instrument
• The myth of Fehrbellin (small power defeating great)
• Religious tolerance as economic policy
• The Political Testament tradition (ruler instructs heir)

A.J.P. Taylor's observation applies:

> "The history of the Germans is a history of extremes. It contains
> everything except moderation."
> — A.J.P. Taylor, *The Course of German History* (1945)
> [ERC: SECONDARY]

Frederick William was extreme in his moderation: patient accumulation,
gradual institution-building, careful avoidance of overreach. He
created the instrument; his descendants would use it to extremes
he might not have approved.
