I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves the War of the Polish Succession as **Germania's
demonstration of eastern entanglement costs**: the conflict in which
Habsburg Austria's involvement in Polish succession politics drew
German resources eastward while France exploited western vulnerability—
revealing the structural penalty of multi-front exposure.

For Germania, this war is not about Polish kingship.
It is about **the cost of eastern commitment**.

Peter Wilson notes the pattern:

> "Austria's engagement in eastern affairs repeatedly exposed the
> Empire's western flank; the price of influence in Poland was
> vulnerability on the Rhine."
> — Peter H. Wilson, *Heart of Europe* (2016)
> [ERC: SECONDARY]

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. STRATEGIC CONTEXT: THE POLISH SUCCESSION CRISIS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The death of Augustus II (1733) triggers competing candidacies.

Claimants:
• Stanisław Leszczyński — French-backed, Louis XV's father-in-law
• Augustus III (Wettin) — Austro-Russian backed, Saxon Elector

The Polish throne is elective, creating perpetual succession instability.
External powers treat Polish elections as proxy competitions.

For Germania, the question is structural:
• Saxon involvement links German and Polish politics
• Habsburg commitment to the Wettin candidate draws Austrian resources
• French counter-intervention exploits the distraction

Poland is not German space, but Polish succession affects German balance.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. AUSTRO-RUSSIAN COORDINATION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Austria and Russia align to impose Augustus III.

Method:
• Russian military intervention in Poland
• Austrian diplomatic and financial support
• Forced election under military pressure
• Leszczyński expelled to Danzig

The Austro-Russian partnership demonstrates eastern coordination
capacity, but at significant cost: Austrian forces committed eastward
cannot defend westward.

Martyn Rady observes:

> "The Habsburgs' Polish engagement reflected their belief that
> influence in the east was essential to European balance—a belief
> that repeatedly overextended their resources."
> — Martyn Rady, *The Habsburgs* (2020)
> [ERC: SECONDARY]

Eastern influence purchases western vulnerability.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. FRENCH EXPLOITATION: THE WESTERN THEATER
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
France uses the Polish crisis to strike westward.

Targets:
• Lorraine (occupied and eventually annexed)
• Rhineland (military pressure)
• Northern Italy (Austrian possessions threatened)

Cardinal Fleury's strategy is opportunistic: while Austria commits
eastward, France advances claims deferred since Ryswick.

The pattern repeats League of Augsburg dynamics:
• German space becomes theater
• Devastation concentrates on frontiers
• Coalition response is slow

Gordon Craig notes:

> "French statecraft understood that Austria could not simultaneously
> police Poland and defend the Rhine; the Polish Succession War
> demonstrated this with uncomfortable clarity."
> — Gordon A. Craig, *The Germans* (1982)
> [ERC: SECONDARY]

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. IMPERIAL PARALYSIS AND PRUSSIAN NEUTRALITY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Empire's response is fragmented.

Conditions:
• Prussia remains neutral (Frederick William I conserves forces)
• Smaller German states pursue divergent interests
• Reich mobilization is slow and under-resourced
• Austria bears disproportionate burden

Prussian neutrality is calculated:

> "The King of Prussia observed that wars for Polish crowns served
> neither Prussian interest nor Prussian security; he would husband
> his strength for conflicts that mattered."
> — Prussian state memorandum, 1733
> [ERC: PRIMARY]

Prussia demonstrates selective engagement logic: not every German
war is a Prussian war. This presages the distinction between imperial
and state interest that will define German dualism.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. THE ITALIAN THEATER
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Significant fighting occurs in Italy, distant from German concerns.

Dynamics:
• Spain (Bourbon) and Sardinia join France against Austria
• Austrian Italian possessions threatened
• Habsburg resources stretched across three fronts

For Germania, the Italian war is relevant only as resource drain.
Austrian attention divides; German defense suffers.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. TREATY OF VIENNA (1738)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The settlement reshapes western German space.

Terms:
• Augustus III confirmed as King of Poland (Austro-Russian victory)
• Leszczyński receives Lorraine as compensation (lifetime tenure)
• Lorraine reverts to France upon Leszczyński's death
• Austria cedes Naples and Sicily to Spanish Bourbons
• Austria receives Parma as partial compensation

For Germania, the critical outcome is Lorraine:
• French acquisition is deferred but guaranteed
• Western frontier permanently weakened
• Buffer zone eliminated

A. J. P. Taylor captures the significance:

> "The War of the Polish Succession seemed a sideshow, yet its
> settlement gave France Lorraine and confirmed that Habsburg
> eastern adventures would be paid for on the Rhine."
> — A. J. P. Taylor, *The Course of German History* (1945)
> [ERC: SECONDARY]

Poland is secured for Saxony.
Lorraine is lost to France.
The exchange benefits neither German security nor German unity.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VIII. PRUSSIAN LESSONS INTERNALIZED
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Frederick William I's neutrality preserves Prussian strength.

By 1740, Prussia enters the Austrian Succession War with:
• Intact treasury
• Unreduced army
• Fresh forces against exhausted Austria

The Polish Succession War teaches Prussia that **selective
non-engagement** can be strategic advantage. Not every imperial
crisis requires Prussian participation.

Christopher Clark notes:

> "Frederick William I understood that Prussia's survival depended
> on concentration, not dispersal; he would not spend Prussian blood
> on Polish thrones."
> — Christopher Clark, *Iron Kingdom* (2006)
> [ERC: SECONDARY]

This lesson transfers directly to Frederick II's strategic calculus.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IX. CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The war encodes **eastern entanglement penalty** into Germanic
strategic memory.

Lessons:
• Eastern commitments expose western frontiers
• Polish succession instability draws German resources
• Multi-front exposure exceeds coordination capacity
• Selective engagement preserves strength
• Imperial interest and state interest diverge

The war confirms that Germania cannot simultaneously dominate
east and defend west. Future German systems must choose priorities
or develop sufficient mass to sustain both—a problem not solved
until Bismarck, and then only temporarily.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
XI. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Eastern commitments create western vulnerabilities.
• Polish succession instability is permanent German entanglement risk.
• Coalition success in the east does not prevent loss in the west.
• Selective non-engagement (Prussia) preserves future options.
• Imperial interest and state interest increasingly diverge.
• Lorraine's loss demonstrates the price of eastern priority.

Tension preserved without verdict.
