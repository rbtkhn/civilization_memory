I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves Charlemagne as the foundational sacral monarch of
Germania: the ruler who transformed fragmented Germanic lordship into a
disciplined, Christian–imperial command structure.

For Germania, Charlemagne represents order imposed through conquest,
discipline, and sacral authority, not consensual federation or civic
integration. His memory encodes coercive unification as legitimate state
formation.

This file records mechanisms of authority formation, not moral verdicts
on justice, necessity, or inevitability.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

II. AUSTRASIAN BASE & WARRIOR GOVERNANAD
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Charlemagne’s power emerged from Austrasian military society structured
around warrior retinues, land-for-service bonds, and personal loyalty
rather than territorial citizenship. Authority flowed downward from
conquest, not upward from consent.

Primary evidence emphasizes personal command as the core political unit:

> “He was tall and sturdy… his bearing was dignified, whether he was
> standing or sitting… his voice was clear, but did not quite match his
> stature.”
> — Einhard, *Vita Karoli Magni*

Will Durant captures his Germanic essence:

> "The greatest of medieval kings was born in 742, at a place unknown.
> He was of German blood and speech, and shared some characteristics
> of his people—strength of body, courage of spirit, pride of race,
> and a crude simplicity many centuries apart from the urbane polish
> of the modern French."
> — Will Durant, *The Age of Faith* (1950)

The emphasis on bodily presence and demeanor reflects a political order
grounded in personal authority rather than institutional impersonality.

III. THE SAXON WARS & COERCIVE INTEGRATION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Saxon Wars (772–804) define German imperial formation through
sustained coercion. Integration occurred not through negotiation but
through forced submission, mass violence, and religious compulsion.

The *Capitulatio de partibus Saxoniae* makes coercive integration explicit:

> “If any one of the Saxons shall have concealed himself unbaptized…
> let him be punished by death.”
> — *Capitulary for Saxony*, c. 782

Durant records the scale of coercion:

> "Charles gave the conquered Saxons a choice between baptism and death,
> and had 4500 Saxon rebels beheaded in one day; after which he proceeded
> to Thionville to celebrate the nativity of Christ."
> — Will Durant, *The Age of Faith* (1950)

Christian law functions here as an enforcement code, fusing belief with
obedience.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. SACRAL MONARCHY & DIVINE AUTHORIZATION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Charlemagne’s authority fused sword and altar. Kingship was understood
as divinely sanctioned command rather than contractual governance.

Einhard records the political theology underpinning this system:

> “He cherished the Christian religion with the utmost piety and
> devotion… He made lavish gifts to the church.”
> — Einhard, *Vita Karoli Magni*

Sacral legitimacy functioned as obedience infrastructure.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. ADMINISTRATIVE COMMAND & CAPITULAR ORDER
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Governance emphasized hierarchical command enforced through royal
agents, inspections, and capitular decrees.

The *Capitulare missorum* formalized administrative penetration:

> “Let the missi inquire diligently whether counts and judges have
> rendered justice… and correct what they find amiss.”
> — *Capitulare missorum*, late 8th century

Durant emphasizes the deeper motivation:

> "In truth he had always loved administration more than war, and had
> taken to the field to force some unity of government and faith upon
> a Western Europe torn for centuries past by conflicts of tribe and creed."
> — Will Durant, *The Age of Faith* (1950)

Administration existed to enforce discipline, not negotiate autonomy.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. IMPERIAL IDENTITY FORMATION IN GERMANIA
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Germania internalized empire as discipline rather than universality.
Imperial identity emphasized obedience, military professionalism, and
sacral legitimacy over civic participation.

Johannes Fried notes that Charlemagne’s empire functioned less as a
coherent polity than as a command network bound by ritual submission
(*Charlemagne*).

Peter Wilson emphasizes that Charlemagne's legacy for the later Holy Roman
Empire was structural rather than territorial: "The empire he created was
less a state than a mode of governance—decentralized, ritualized, and
bound by the idea of Christian order" (*The Holy Roman Empire*).

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. POST-CHARLEMAGNE TRAJECTORY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Following fragmentation, East Francia retained imperial logic even as
political unity dissolved. Sacral kingship and command discipline
persisted, laying foundations for later imperial forms.

Imperial memory endured without continuous sovereignty.
