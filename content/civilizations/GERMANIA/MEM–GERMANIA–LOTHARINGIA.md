I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves Lotharingia as **Germania's contested
inheritance**: the Middle Kingdom created at Verdun, absorbed
into German control, yet never fully assimilated—the territory
whose possession defined Franco-German rivalry.

Lotharingia is not remembered as a failed state.
It is remembered as **the battleground between France and
Germany**—the strip of territory whose control determined
European power balance from the ninth century to the twentieth.

For Germania, Lotharingia represents the western frontier:
territory claimed, held, contested, lost, and recovered across
twelve centuries. Its components—Lorraine, Alsace, Luxembourg,
the Rhineland, the Low Countries—remained the Franco-German
battlefield until European integration made the question moot.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

II. CREATION AND GEOGRAPHY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Lotharingia emerged from Carolingian partition:

TREATY OF VERDUN (843):
Emperor Lothar I received the Middle Kingdom: a strip of
territory from the North Sea to Italy, including Aachen
(Charlemagne's capital), Rome (imperial coronation site),
and the lands between East and West Francia.

GEOGRAPHIC EXTENT:
• Northern section: Frisia, the Low Countries, the lower Rhine
• Central section: The middle Rhine, the Moselle valley,
  territory between Meuse and Rhine
• Southern section: Burgundy, Provence, the Rhône valley
• Italian section: The Lombard kingdom

> "Lothar's kingdom was a political construct, not a natural
> unit. It was drawn to give him a realm matching his brothers'
> in resources, not to create a coherent polity. It stretched
> a thousand miles from sea to sea, united only by Lothar's
> person."
> — Peter H. Wilson, *Heart of Europe* (2016), p. 89
> [ERC: SECONDARY]

AACHEN:
Lothar retained Aachen—Charlemagne's capital and burial site.
The city's symbolic importance exceeded its strategic value;
possession meant Carolingian legitimacy.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. FRAGMENTATION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Middle Kingdom could not survive intact:

PRÜM PARTITION (855):
Lothar I's death divided his realm among three sons:
• Louis II: Italy and the imperial title
• Lothar II: The northern region (Lotharingia proper)
• Charles: Provence

LOTHARINGIA DEFINED:
The term "Lotharingia" (Lothar's realm) applied specifically
to Lothar II's kingdom: the territory between the Meuse and
Rhine, from the North Sea to the Alps. This core region
retained the name after the larger Middle Kingdom dissolved.

> "Lotharingia narrowed from Lothar I's vast inheritance to
> Lothar II's compact kingdom. The name persisted as the
> larger structure fragmented. Lotharingia became the label
> for the contested zone—the territory neither France nor
> Germany could concede to the other."
> — Johannes Fried, *The Middle Ages* (2015), p. 98
> [ERC: SECONDARY]

TREATY OF MEERSSEN (870):
Lothar II died without legitimate heir. East and West Francia
partitioned Lotharingia between them. The Middle Kingdom as
independent entity ceased to exist.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. GERMAN ACQUISITION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Lotharingia became German territory:

TREATY OF RIBEMONT (880):
The entire former Lotharingia passed to East Francia. Louis
the Younger (Louis the German's son) received the territory;
the German kingdom absorbed the Middle Kingdom.

OTTONIAN CONSOLIDATION:
Henry I and Otto I incorporated Lotharingia into the German
kingdom as a duchy. Bruno of Cologne (Otto I's brother) served
as Duke of Lotharingia (953–965), integrating the region into
the Ottonian system.

> "The Ottonian absorption of Lotharingia was not conquest but
> consolidation. The territory had fluctuated between eastern
> and western kingdoms for decades. Otto I's achievement was
> making the German claim permanent—binding Lotharingia to
> the Empire for centuries."
> — Peter H. Wilson, *Heart of Europe* (2016), p. 95
> [ERC: SECONDARY]

DIVISION (959):
Lotharingia was divided into two duchies: Upper Lorraine
(the south, around Metz) and Lower Lorraine (the north,
including Brabant and the Low Countries). The division
persisted throughout the medieval period.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. STRATEGIC SIGNIFICANCE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Lotharingia's geography determined its importance:

RHINE CONTROL:
Lotharingia controlled the middle and lower Rhine—the
principal trade artery of northwestern Europe. Whoever
held Lotharingia controlled Rhine commerce.

COMMUNICATION ROUTES:
The territory contained the routes connecting Germany to
the North Sea, France to the Rhineland, and the Alps to
Flanders. All major northwestern European trade passed
through Lotharingian territory.

> "Lotharingia was the crossroads of northwestern Europe.
> The Rhine, the Meuse, the Moselle—all flowed through it.
> The routes from Italy to the North Sea, from France to
> Germany, converged in Lotharingian territory. Control
> meant commercial and strategic dominance."
> — Brendan Simms, *Europe: The Struggle for Supremacy* (2013), p. 28
> [ERC: SECONDARY]

POLITICAL BALANCE:
The territory's resources—agricultural wealth, urban
development, strategic position—made it the prize of
Franco-German competition. Neither power could accept
the other's unchallenged possession.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. MEDIEVAL DEVELOPMENT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Lotharingia developed within the Empire:

ECCLESIASTICAL PRINCIPALITIES:
The great prince-bishoprics of the region—Cologne, Trier,
Liège, Utrecht—became ecclesiastical states within the
Empire. Their prince-bishops were Imperial Electors and
powerful political actors.

URBAN DEVELOPMENT:
Cities flourished: Cologne (the Empire's largest city),
Aachen, Liège, Trier, Metz. Urban commerce and craft
production made Lotharingia economically vital.

> "Medieval Lotharingia was the Empire's most urbanized,
> most commercialized region. Cologne alone exceeded any
> German city in population and wealth. The ecclesiastical
> princes of the region—the Electors of Cologne, Trier, and
> Mainz—shaped imperial elections."
> — Peter H. Wilson, *Heart of Europe* (2016), p. 198
> [ERC: SECONDARY]

BURGUNDIAN ABSORPTION:
The Duchy of Burgundy (1363–1477) united much of the former
Lower Lotharingia (the Low Countries) with French Burgundy.
Charles the Bold's ambitions recreated a Middle Kingdom;
his death ended the project.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. EARLY MODERN CONTESTATION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Lotharingian territory became Franco-German battleground:

HABSBURG INHERITANCE:
Charles V's Burgundian inheritance included the Low Countries.
The Habsburg Netherlands represented the northern Lotharingian
legacy—territory technically within the Empire but
increasingly distinct.

FRENCH EXPANSION:
Louis XIV's reunions policy claimed Lotharingian territories.
Strasbourg (1681), Alsace, and eventually Lorraine (1766)
passed to France. The western edge of old Lotharingia became
French.

> "Louis XIV's acquisitions represented the French reconquest
> of Lotharingia—territory France had lost in 870. The Rhine
> became France's objective; Strasbourg's seizure announced
> that the old Middle Kingdom was now French target. Germany's
> western frontier was contested."
> — Brendan Simms, *Europe: The Struggle for Supremacy* (2013), p. 112
> [ERC: SECONDARY]

THREE BISHOPRICS:
France acquired Metz, Toul, and Verdun (1552)—the first
permanent French gains in Lotharingian territory. The
acquisition demonstrated that the imperial western frontier
was vulnerable.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VIII. MODERN TRANSFORMATION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The nineteenth and twentieth centuries resolved the question:

REVOLUTIONARY ANNEXATION:
Revolutionary France annexed the left bank of the Rhine
(1795–1797). All former Lotharingian territory west of
the Rhine became French.

VIENNA SETTLEMENT (1815):
The Congress of Vienna restored some territories but left
Alsace and Lorraine with France. Prussia gained the Rhineland—
former Lower Lotharingian territory—establishing Prussian
presence on the French frontier.

FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR:
German victory (1871) reclaimed Alsace and part of Lorraine.
The annexation reversed centuries of French gains; revanche
became French policy.

> "The Franco-Prussian War was fought over Lotharingian
> inheritance. Alsace-Lorraine—the name combining the medieval
> duchies—became the symbol of Franco-German conflict. The
> territory had oscillated between kingdoms since 843; the
> oscillation continued."
> — Johannes Fried, *The Middle Ages* (2015), p. 102
> [ERC: SECONDARY]

WORLD WARS:
Alsace-Lorraine returned to France (1918), was occupied by
Germany (1940–1944), and returned to France (1945). The
Rhineland was demilitarized, occupied, and remilitarized.
The Lotharingian question was finally resolved not by
conquest but by integration.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IX. EUROPEAN INTEGRATION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Integration transcended the medieval division:

SCHUMAN DECLARATION (1950):
Robert Schuman—born in Luxembourg, educated in Germany,
French foreign minister—proposed pooling coal and steel.
The proposal emerged from Lotharingian identity: the border
region that understood both nations.

EUROPEAN INSTITUTIONS:
Luxembourg, Strasbourg, and Brussels—all former Lotharingian
cities—became seats of European institutions. The contested
zone became the integration center.

> "European integration was born in Lotharingia. Schuman came
> from the borderland; the institutions settled in borderland
> cities. The territory that had divided France and Germany
> became the territory that united Europe. The Middle Kingdom
> found its purpose."
> — Brendan Simms, *Europe: The Struggle for Supremacy* (2013), p. 458
> [ERC: SECONDARY]

RESOLUTION:
The Lotharingian question—which power would control the
Middle Kingdom?—was resolved by making the question obsolete.
European integration meant neither France nor Germany
controlled Lotharingia; both shared it.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
X. DOCTRINAL IMPLICATIONS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Lotharingia instantiates the CONTESTED CORRIDOR pattern:

PATTERN: A territory of strategic value lies between two
powers. Neither can accept the other's control; neither can
permanently hold it against the other. The contest structures
their relationship until external transformation (integration)
resolves it.

APPLICABLE DOCTRINES:
• DOCTRINE 06: Corridor Depth Over Dispersed Reach — Lotharingia
  was the corridor; its control determined Franco-German balance
• DOCTRINE 04: Multi-Vector Alliance Necessity — Control of
  Lotharingia affected alliance possibilities

RLL CONNECTION:
• RLL–GERMANIA–0007 (Western Frontier Anxiety): Lotharingia's
  vulnerability generated permanent security concern
• RLL–GERMANIA–0001 (Land Power Constraint): The exposed western
  frontier was the Lotharingian inheritance
