I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves the Austro-Prussian War as **Germania's resolution
of the German Question through force**: the war that ended 123 years of
Habsburg-Hohenzollern dualism by excluding Austria from German affairs
and establishing Prussian hegemony over the German states.

The war is not merely a territorial adjustment.
It is the **structural prerequisite for German unification**: the
elimination of Austria as a competitor for German leadership.

For Germania, this war encodes the lesson that **limited war with
immediate diplomatic closure achieves what prolonged conflict cannot**.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. ORIGINS: GERMAN DUALISM AND THE SILESIAN WOUND
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The war's origins trace to the Silesian Wars (1740–1763).

Frederick II's seizure of Silesia created permanent Austria-Prussia
rivalry. For 123 years (1740–1866), the German space was contested
between Habsburg and Hohenzollern. Neither could unify Germany while
the other remained a German power.

Peter Wilson notes the structural constraint:

> "German dualism was not a policy choice but a structural condition.
> As long as both Austria and Prussia claimed German leadership,
> neither could achieve it."
> — Peter Wilson, *Heart of Europe* (2016)

The German Confederation (1815–1866) institutionalized dualism without
resolving it. Austria presided; Prussia waited.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. BISMARCK'S STRATEGIC PREPARATION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Otto von Bismarck, Prussian Minister-President from 1862, prepared
the conditions for Austrian exclusion.

Preparatory steps:
• Army reform (Roon): expanded conscription, modern equipment
• Italian alliance (April 1866): two-front pressure on Austria
• French neutrality (Napoleon III's ambiguity exploited)
• Russian benevolence (gratitude for Polish revolt support, 1863)
• Danish War (1864): joint Austria-Prussia victory, then dispute

Henry Kissinger identifies Bismarck's achievement:

> "The greatest diplomatic and political achievement by any leader in
> the last two centuries."
> — Henry Kissinger, *Diplomacy* (1994)

The Schleswig-Holstein dispute over Danish war spoils provided the
immediate casus belli, but the war's purpose was always Austrian
exclusion from Germany.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. THE SEVEN WEEKS' WAR (JUNE–AUGUST 1866)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
War began June 14, 1866, when Austria requested German Confederation
mobilization against Prussia. Prussia declared the Confederation dissolved.

Prussian advantages:
• Breech-loading needle gun (Dreyse) vs. Austrian muzzle-loaders
• Railroad mobilization (faster concentration)
• Unified command (Moltke's general staff)
• Superior training and doctrine

Most German states sided with Austria: Bavaria, Saxony, Hanover,
Baden, Württemberg, and others. Prussia faced a coalition.

Key operations:
• Hanover campaign: quick Prussian victory; annexed
• Main campaign: Prussian armies invaded Bohemia from multiple directions
• Italian front: Austria defeated Italy at Custoza (June 24) but
  could not transfer forces north

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. KÖNIGGRÄTZ (SADOWA): THE DECISIVE BATTLE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The war was decided at Königgrätz (July 3, 1866).

Three Prussian armies converged on the Austrian position in Bohemia.
The Austrian commander, Benedek, concentrated at Königgrätz-Sadowa
for defensive battle.

Battle dynamics:
• First Army (Prince Frederick Charles) engaged frontally
• Second Army (Crown Prince Frederick) arrived late but decisively
• Needle gun superiority devastated Austrian infantry
• Austrian cavalry charges failed against rapid Prussian fire

Casualties:
• Austria: ~44,000 (killed, wounded, captured)
• Prussia: ~9,000

The battle destroyed Austria's main army and ended the war.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. BISMARCK'S RESTRAINT: THE CRITICAL DECISION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Bismarck's genius lay not in winning but in **stopping**.

After Königgrätz, Prussian generals (including King Wilhelm I) wanted
to march on Vienna and impose humiliating terms. Bismarck resisted.

His logic:
• Prolonged war invites French intervention
• Humiliated Austria becomes permanent enemy
• Limited terms enable future reconciliation
• Objective was Austrian exclusion, not destruction

Kissinger emphasizes the restraint:

> "Bismarck's achievement was to know when to stop. He understood that
> the purpose of war was not victory but a peace that served political
> objectives."
> — Henry Kissinger, *Diplomacy* (1994)

Bismarck reportedly threatened to throw himself from a window if the
king refused moderate terms.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. TREATY OF PRAGUE (AUGUST 23, 1866)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The peace was remarkably lenient.

Terms:
• German Confederation dissolved
• Austria excluded from German affairs
• North German Confederation formed under Prussian leadership
• Austria ceded no territory to Prussia (Venetia transferred to Italy)
• No war indemnity of note
• Austrian integrity preserved

The moderate peace enabled Austro-German alliance by 1879.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VIII. CONSEQUENCES: KLEINDEUTSCH SOLUTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The war resolved the German Question through the "Kleindeutsch"
(small German) solution: Germany unified under Prussia, without Austria.

Immediate consequences:
• North German Confederation (1867): Prussian-dominated
• Austrian Germans separated from German nation
• South German states (Bavaria, Württemberg, Baden) remained nominally
  independent but bound by military treaties
• Hanover, Hesse-Kassel, Nassau, Frankfurt annexed to Prussia

Long-term consequences:
• Franco-Prussian War (1870–1871) completed unification
• German Empire proclaimed at Versailles (1871)
• Austria reoriented toward Hungary (Ausgleich, 1867)
• German dualism ended; German nationalism triumphed

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IX. CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
For Germania, the Austro-Prussian War encodes critical lessons:

• Limited war with clear objectives achieves lasting results
• Restraint in victory enables future reconciliation
• Technological superiority (needle gun) decides short wars
• Diplomatic preparation determines military success
• German unification required Austrian exclusion, not destruction
• The Silesian wound (1740) was healed only by force (1866)

The war demonstrates Bismarckian statecraft: **violence as instrument,
never ideology; force calibrated to political purpose**.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
X. MEARSHEIMER STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

X.A. POWER DISTRIBUTION
The war resolved German dualism by establishing Prussian hegemony.
Austria's exclusion created a single dominant power in the German space.

X.B. OFFENSIVE ADVANTAGE
Prussia's technological and organizational superiority enabled rapid
decision. The seven-week timeline prevented intervention and coalition
reformation.

X.C. LIMITED WAR THEORY
Bismarck's restraint exemplifies limited war: violence sufficient to
achieve political objective, then immediate cessation. Austria was
excluded, not destroyed.

X.D. BALANCING FAILURE
The German states failed to balance effectively against Prussia.
Coalition with Austria was too slow; Prussian victory too rapid.
By the time France considered intervention, the war was over.

XI. MEM CONNECTIONS (MANDATORY)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
GERMANIA (Same-Civilization):

• MEM–GERMANIA–BISMARCK
  Dependency: War architect—Bismarck designed isolation, provocation, and
  moderate peace.
  Breaks if removed: War appears as military event without political
  design; restraint after Königgrätz has no agent.

• MEM–GERMANIA–PRUSSIA
  Dependency: Victorious state—Prussia's institutional structure enabled
  rapid mobilization and operational superiority.
  Breaks if removed: Who won the war has no institutional anchor.

• MEM–GERMANIA–AUSTRIA
  Dependency: Defeated rival—Austrian exclusion from Germany was the war's
  purpose. Habsburg-Hohenzollern dualism ended.
  Breaks if removed: What was resolved by war disappears; German Question
  answer has no defeated party.

• MEM–GERMANIA–DYNASTY–HOHENZOLLERN
  Dependency: Victorious dynasty—Hohenzollern hegemony over German states
  established through victory.
  Breaks if removed: Dynastic dimension of unification disappears; why
  Wilhelm I rather than Franz Joseph led Germany unexplained.

• MEM–GERMANIA–DYNASTY–HAPSBURG
  Dependency: Defeated dynasty—Habsburg exclusion from Germany ended
  centuries of imperial precedence.
  Breaks if removed: Austrian side of dualism has no dynasty; 1438–1806
  imperial tradition loses heir.

• MEM–GERMANIA–WAR–SILESIAN
  Dependency: Origin of dualism—Frederick II's 1740 seizure of Silesia
  created Austria-Prussia rivalry that 1866 resolved.
  Breaks if removed: 123-year wound (1740–1866) loses origin; why Austria
  and Prussia were rivals unintelligible.

• MEM–GERMANIA–WAR–FRANCO–PRUSSIAN
  Dependency: Successor war—1870 completed what 1866 began. Limited war
  pattern validated and repeated.
  Breaks if removed: 1866 appears as isolated event rather than first of
  two; sequential unification pattern incomplete.

• MEM–GERMANIA–SAXONY
  Dependency: Austrian ally, occupied—Saxony fought for Austria; Prussia
  occupied but did not annex. Moderate treatment demonstrated.
  Breaks if removed: How Prussia treated German allies of Austria
  undocumented; North German Confederation formation logic incomplete.

• MEM–GERMANIA–BOHEMIA
  Dependency: Campaign theater—Königgrätz fought in Bohemia. Austrian
  army concentrated there for decisive battle.
  Breaks if removed: Where war was decided geographically unclear;
  Bohemian campaign has no geographic anchor.

• MEM–GERMANIA–HIST–CLAUSEWITZ
  Dependency: Limited war theory—Clausewitzian "war as politics by other
  means" exemplified. Violence calibrated to political purpose.
  Breaks if removed: Theoretical framework for limited war disappears;
  Bismarck's method appears intuitive rather than doctrinally grounded.

• MEM–GERMANIA–PRUSSIA–FREDERICK–II
  Dependency: Silesian wound origin—Frederick created the rivalry;
  Bismarck resolved it. Direct causal chain.
  Breaks if removed: Why Austria-Prussia rivalry existed unintelligible;
  1866 appears as random conflict.

GEO MEMs:

• MEM–GERMANIA–GEO–ELBE–RIVER
  Dependency: Saxon corridor—Elbe valley defined Saxon campaign theater
  and Prussian approach routes.
  Breaks if removed: Campaign geography for northern theater disappears.

• MEM–GERMANIA–GEO–DANUBE
  Dependency: Austrian retreat axis—Danube corridor = Austrian fallback
  route toward Vienna. Why Bismarck stopped before Vienna related to
  Danube depth.
  Breaks if removed: Austrian defensive geography disappears; stopping
  logic loses terrain dimension.

Cross-Civilizational:

• MEM–FRANCIA–NAPOLEON–III
  Dependency: Neutral observer, future target—Napoleon III's neutrality
  enabled Prussian victory; his compensation demands set up 1870.
  Breaks if removed: Why France didn't intervene unexplained; 1870 war
  origin loses setup.

• MEM–RUSSIA–ALEXANDER–II
  Dependency: Benevolent neutrality—Russia's non-intervention (gratitude
  for 1863 Polish revolt support) enabled Prussian action.
  Breaks if removed: Why Russia didn't support Austria unexplained;
  Bismarck's diplomatic preparation incomplete.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
XII. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• German unification required Austrian exclusion, not compromise.
• Limited war with immediate closure achieves durable results.

• Technological superiority decides short wars.
• Diplomatic preparation determines military success.
• The Silesian wound (1740) structured German politics for 123 years.

XIII. PEDAGOGICAL AFFORDANCE LAYER
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This MEM supports curiosity-led exploration.

Exploration prompts may include:
A) What if Austria had won at Königgrätz?
B) Compare Bismarck's restraint to Wilhelm II's later excess.
C) Why did France not intervene in 1866?
D) How did the moderate peace enable the Austro-German alliance of 1879?

No option implies correctness. Exploration governs progression.
