I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves Quebec as **Francia's loss of North American empire**:
the battle that ended 150 years of French colonial presence on the
continent and demonstrated that colonial power requires metropolitan
commitment.

For Francia, Quebec is **abandonment encoded**—the moment when
European wars took priority over colonial defense, and New France
was sacrificed to concentrate resources against Prussia and Britain
in Europe.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. STRATEGIC CONTEXT: THE SEVEN YEARS' WAR
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
France fights a two-front war it cannot sustain.

The dilemma:
• War in Europe against Prussia and Britain
• War in North America against British colonies
• War in India against British East India Company
• Limited resources; priorities must be set
• Choiseul decides: Europe first, colonies second

John Keegan frames the strategic situation:

"New France was always vulnerable. Its population was tiny—perhaps
70,000 Europeans against over a million in the British colonies.
Its economy depended on the fur trade, not agriculture. Its supply
line stretched across the Atlantic, vulnerable to British naval
power. When the Seven Years' War began, France faced a choice:
reinforce the colonies or concentrate in Europe. The French court
chose Europe. New France would have to survive on what it had."
— John Keegan, *Fields of Battle* (1996)

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. MONTCALM AND NEW FRANCE'S DEFENSE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Marquis de Montcalm commands a doomed defense.

Montcalm's situation:
• Sent to Canada 1756 with limited reinforcements
• Must defend vast territory with ~6,000 regulars
• Canadian militia adds numbers but not European discipline
• Native allies unreliable for siege warfare
• Conflict with Governor Vaudreuil over strategy

The strategic tension:

"Montcalm was a European general fighting a European war in North
America. He wanted to concentrate forces, fight set-piece battles,
defend key positions. Vaudreuil, the Canadian-born governor, wanted
guerrilla warfare, raids, the exploitation of Native alliances. They
disagreed on everything. Montcalm saw Canada as indefensible without
massive reinforcement; Vaudreuil believed Canadian methods could
hold the British indefinitely. Neither was entirely wrong; both
were ultimately right that France had abandoned them."
— John Keegan, *Fields of Battle* (1996)

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. WOLFE'S GAMBLE: THE PLAINS OF ABRAHAM
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Wolfe attempts an audacious assault.

The situation:
• British fleet controls St. Lawrence River
• Quebec seemingly impregnable on cliffs
• Summer of bombardment achieves nothing
• Wolfe desperate as campaign season ends
• Night assault via Anse-au-Foulon path

The assault:

"Wolfe's decision to scale the cliffs at Anse-au-Foulon was a gamble
born of desperation. His previous attacks had failed; his officers
had lost confidence in him; his army was ravaged by disease. On the
night of September 12-13, he sent 4,400 men up a path the French
considered impassable. By dawn, they stood on the Plains of Abraham,
behind Quebec's defenses. Montcalm, instead of waiting for
reinforcement, attacked immediately. It was the European response—
and the fatal one."
— John Keegan, *Fields of Battle* (1996)

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. THE BATTLE: FIFTEEN MINUTES
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Plains of Abraham is decided in a single volley exchange.

The sequence:
• French advance in loose formation (Canadian style)
• British hold fire until 40 yards
• Single devastating volley
• British bayonet charge
• French break in minutes
• Both commanders mortally wounded

The tactical moment:

"The Battle of the Plains of Abraham lasted perhaps fifteen minutes.
The British had been ordered to load with two balls; they held fire
as the French advanced, fired at point-blank range, then charged
with bayonets. The French, who had not formed proper lines, broke
almost immediately. Wolfe was hit three times and died on the field;
Montcalm was shot through the body and died the next morning. The
battle that decided North America was over before either commander
knew he had won or lost."
— John Keegan, *Fields of Battle* (1996)

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. MONTCALM'S DEATH: DEFEAT ACCEPTED
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Montcalm dies knowing New France is lost.

His final words (attributed):
"So much the better. I shall not see the English in Quebec."

The meaning:

"Montcalm's death was not merely personal tragedy but symbolic
closure. He had known for years that New France was doomed without
metropolitan support that would never come. His letters to Versailles
were increasingly bitter; he accused the court of abandoning the
colony. In death, he escaped the surrender he knew was inevitable.
The governor Vaudreuil would sign the capitulation; Montcalm would
not have to witness French colors lowered over Quebec."
— Francis Parkman, *Montcalm and Wolfe* (1884)

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. THE TREATY OF PARIS (1763): COLONIAL EMPIRE ENDS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
France sacrifices North America for Caribbean sugar.

Treaty terms:
• Canada ceded to Britain
• Louisiana east of Mississippi to Britain
• Louisiana west of Mississippi to Spain (compensation)
• France retains Martinique, Guadeloupe, St. Lucia
• France retains fishing rights off Newfoundland

The calculation:

"Choiseul's decision to abandon Canada for the sugar islands was
rational by the economics of the time. The Caribbean colonies
produced more revenue than all of Canada. Sugar was valuable; fur
was not. But the decision encoded a deeper truth: France was a
continental power, not a maritime one. Colonial empire required
naval supremacy, and France would never match British sea power.
Quebec fell because Versailles decided, consciously or not, that
North America was not worth the fleet required to defend it."
— John Keegan, *Fields of Battle* (1996)

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VIII. CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Quebec encodes **continental priority over colonial expansion**.

For Francia, Quebec establishes:
• European wars take precedence over colonial defense
• Naval inferiority limits colonial sustainability
• Colonies can be sacrificed for metropolitan survival
• France is a continental power, not a maritime empire

The memory persists:
• 1803: Napoleon sells Louisiana (same logic)
• 1860s: Mexican adventure fails (colonial limits)
• 1954: Indochina abandoned (same pattern)
• 1962: Algeria abandoned (colonial era ends)

DOCTRINE v0.4 (Post-Hegemonic Strategic Anxiety) finds colonial form:
France's inability to sustain global empire produces anxiety masked
by universalist rhetoric about "civilization."

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IX. FRENCH CANADA: THE RESIDUE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Quebec's French population survives British conquest.

The persistence:
• ~70,000 French Canadians at conquest
• British allow French law, Catholic Church
• French language and culture survive
• Quebec remains French-speaking to present
• "Je me souviens" (I remember) as provincial motto

The paradox:

"France lost Canada, but French Canada survived. The British,
having conquered a population they could not assimilate, chose
accommodation. The Quebec Act of 1774 guaranteed French civil
law and Catholic worship. The habitants stayed; they multiplied;
they remembered. Modern Quebec is the monument to New France—
a French society that exists because France abandoned it to
a conqueror tolerant enough to let it survive."
— John Keegan, *Fields of Battle* (1996)

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
X. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• France chose European war over colonial defense.
• Naval inferiority made colonial empire unsustainable.
• Quebec fell to a fifteen-minute battle.
• Both commanders died; France lost anyway.
• Treaty of Paris traded Canada for sugar islands.
• Louisiana sale (1803) follows same continental logic.
• French Canada survived British conquest through accommodation.
• France is continental, not maritime—Quebec proves it.
• Colonial abandonment pattern repeats (Indochina, Algeria).
• "Je me souviens"—Quebec remembers what France abandoned.

Contradictions preserved without verdict.
