I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves the **storming of the Bastille** (14 July 1789)
as **Francia's revolutionary rupture in a single day**: the seizure
of the royal fortress-prison by a Parisian crowd that turned a
symbol of arbitrary power into the opening act of the Revolution.

The Bastille is not merely captured.
It is **demolished in memory and stone**—the ancien régime's
arbitrariness made visible, then erased.

For Francia, the event encodes **legitimacy transfer through
violence**: the moment when the people, not the king, claimed
sovereignty by destroying the site of lettres de cachet and
royal imprisonment.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

Descartes had grounded certainty in the thinking subject, not in royal or institutional authority:

> "I think, therefore I am."
> — Descartes, *Discours de la méthode* (1637) (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD) [ERC-CONTEXTUAL]

Voltaire had framed the risk of arbitrary power:

> "It is dangerous to be right when the government is wrong."
> — Voltaire, letter (1762) (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD) [ERC-CONTEXTUAL]

Rousseau had framed what the seizure of the Bastille would claim to undo:

> "Man is born free; and everywhere he is in chains."
> — Rousseau, *Du contrat social* (1762) (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD) [ERC-CONTEXTUAL]

The Bastille embodied the "government" that could not tolerate being wrong; the crowd acted in the name of the sovereign people.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. PRE-14 JULY: THE BASTILLE AS SYMBOL
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Before the storming, the Bastille functioned as both prison and
symbol.

Context:
• Royal fortress adapted as prison (especially for high-status or
  "political" detainees)
• Lettres de cachet (arbitrary detention without trial)
• Relatively few prisoners by 1789 (seven when stormed) but
  immense symbolic weight
• Paris in crisis: Necker dismissed (11 July); troops perceived
  as threat; search for arms and powder

The building concentrated **arbitrary royal authority** in one
visible site—making it the obvious target once the crowd sought
weapons and a demonstrative act.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. THE STORMING (14 JULY 1789)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The attack is a blend of practical need and symbolic destruction.

Sequence:
• Morning: crowd seeks arms (Invalides; then Bastille for powder)
• Negotiation fails; governor (Launay) refuses surrender
• Assault; cannon brought; gates forced
• Governor and several defenders killed; prisoners (few) released
• Bastille falls to the crowd

Jeremy D. Popkin frames the Revolution as the crucible of modern
politics: "The French Revolution [is] the laboratory in which all
the possibilities of modern politics, both positive and negative,
were tested for the first time" (*A New World Begins: The History
of the French Revolution* [New York: Basic Books, 2019])
(ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-SECONDARY]. The storming of the Bastille is
**one of the first experiments** in that laboratory—popular
sovereignty asserted through the seizure and destruction of a
royal symbol.

Violence is both instrumental (arms, powder) and performative
(breaking the king's prison).

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. SYMBOLIC MEANING: RUPTURE MADE VISIBLE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The fall of the Bastille is immediately read as regime change.

Interpretations:
• End of arbitrary imprisonment (lettres de cachet)
• People as sovereign—the crowd acts where the king had commanded
• Paris as the Revolution's stage; the capital legitimizes the
  National Assembly
• Destruction of the building (demolition 1789–1791) erases the
  symbol and prevents restoration

The king is told of the fall; he is reported to ask "Is it a
revolt?" and to receive the answer "No, Sire, it is a revolution."
Whether apocryphal or not, the line captures the shift: not
rebellion to be suppressed, but **sovereignty transferred**.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. LEGITIMACY TRANSFER AND THE CROWN
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The event forces the crown to acknowledge the new power center.

Effects:
• Louis XVI withdraws troops from Paris; recalls Necker
• He accepts the tricolor cockade (blue, white, red) at the Hôtel
  de Ville—formal recognition of Parisian and revolutionary
  authority
• The Bastille's fall becomes the proof that the people have
  seized the initiative; the Assembly and the Paris Commune
  derive legitimacy from it

Monarchical authority does not yet end legally—but **symbolically**
the Bastille's fall marks the moment when the king's power to
imprison arbitrarily and to command Paris is broken.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. DEMOLITION AND FESTIVAL
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The physical erasure of the Bastille completes the symbolic one.

Actions:
• Demolition ordered; contractor Palloy oversees; stones sold or
  distributed as relics
• Site becomes Place de la Bastille; later Column of July (1830)
• 14 July becomes the national festival (Fête de la Fédération
  1790; later Bastille Day)

The building is **replaced by empty space and then by new
symbols**—revolutionary and later republican. The prison cannot
be restored; the event is irreversible in stone and in ritual.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. CIVILIZATIONAL SIGNIFICANCE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
For Francia, the Bastille encodes:

• **Rupture in a day**—sovereignty can shift through one
  demonstrative act when legitimacy is already fragile
• **Symbolic target choice**—the crowd attacks the site that
  best condenses arbitrary power
• **Paris as revolutionary arbiter**—the capital's action
  validates the Assembly and forces the king to yield
• **Destruction as commitment**—demolition prevents return;
  the new order is built on the erasure of the old

The storming does not create the Revolution alone (Estates-General,
tennis court oath, National Assembly precede it)—but it **fixes**
the Revolution in space and time: 14 July 1789, Paris, the
Bastille.

VIII. MEM CONNECTIONS (MANDATORY)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
FRANCIA (each connection structurally necessary):

• **MEM–FRANCIA–FRENCH–REVOLUTION** — Bastille as opening rupture of the Revolution; removal breaks event sequence.
• **MEM–FRANCIA–FRENCH–REVOLUTION–DIRECTORY** — Later regime; Bastille as founding myth of revolutionary legitimacy.
• **MEM–FRANCIA–FRENCH–REVOLUTION–JACOBIN** — Jacobins inherit the Parisian crowd's symbolic repertoire; Bastille as template.
• **MEM–FRANCIA–FRENCH–REVOLUTION–REIGN–TERROR** — Terror as later phase; Bastille as non-terrorist but demonstrative violence.
• **MEM–FRANCIA–FRENCH–REVOLUTION–ROBESPIERRE** — Robespierre's revolution builds on 1789; Bastille as founding moment.
• **MEM–FRANCIA–ESTATES–GENERAL** — Estates-General and Assembly precede Bastille; Bastille secures Paris for the Revolution.
• **MEM–FRANCIA–LOUIS–XVI** — King's loss of initiative; recognition of Paris after 14 July.
• **MEM–FRANCIA–DECLARATION–RIGHTS–MAN** — Rights rhetoric amplified after Bastille; liberty from arbitrary detention.
• **MEM–FRANCIA–LAFAYETTE** — Lafayette and National Guard; post-Bastille order in Paris.
• **MEM–FRANCIA–PARIS** — Bastille as Paris event; capital as revolutionary stage. Structurally necessary.
• **MEM–FRANCIA–GEO–SEINE–RIVER** — Paris geography; Bastille site. GEO requirement (≥2).
• **MEM–FRANCIA–GEO–RHINE–RIVER** — Eastern frontier; Revolution's later war context. GEO requirement.

Cross-civilizational: (None required for minimum.)

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IX. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• One building can condense regime legitimacy—and its fall can mark transfer.
• Crowds choose targets that maximize symbolic and practical gain (arms, powder, symbol).
• Demolition prevents counter-revolutionary restoration of the site.
• 14 July becomes national ritual; the event is reproduced in memory and festival.
• The Bastille storming does not invent popular sovereignty but makes it visible in one day.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
X. MEM INGEST BOOTSTRAP
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
When ingested without CORE: confirm ingest; declare MEM active; present exactly EIGHT exploration options.

Options: (1) Trace Bastille → Estates-General → Assembly → Terror sequence. (2) Compare Bastille to other revolutionary seizures (Tuileries, etc.). (3) Apply Mearsheimer lens: force, control of capital, legitimacy. (4) Apply Barnes lens: jurisdiction, who had authority to storm, liability. (5) Follow MEM–FRANCIA–PARIS (capital as stage). (6) Follow MEM–FRANCIA–LOUIS–XVI (king's response). (7) Follow MEM–FRANCIA–DECLARATION–RIGHTS–MAN (rights after Bastille). (8) Explore MEM–FRANCIA–GEO–SEINE–RIVER and Paris geography.
