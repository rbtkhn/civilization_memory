I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves the Louisiana Purchase (1803) as **Francia's
definitive exit from continental North America**: the transaction
whereby Napoleon sold the entire Louisiana territory to the United
States—territory France had only just recovered from Spain in
1800—ending the First Empire's American dimension and encoding the
collapse of Napoleon's Caribbean-centered strategy after Haitian
defeat.

The Purchase is not a minor cession.
It is **empire's American remnant sold**—rational under constraint,
and the closing act of French New World presence.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

II. CONTEXT: LOUISIANA FROM 1763 TO 1800
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Louisiana enters the story as territory already lost once.

Sequence:
• 1763: Treaty of Paris—Louisiana east of Mississippi to Britain;
  Louisiana west of Mississippi to Spain (compensation for Florida)
• 1763–1800: Spanish Louisiana—New Orleans and lower Mississippi
  under Spanish administration; upper Louisiana (French settlements,
  trade) loosely governed
• French imperial presence in North America reduced to Caribbean
  (Saint-Domingue, Martinique, Guadeloupe) after 1763

Anderson (ARC-T-MODERN) on why 1763 broke French North America:

> "Success in the war depended less on victories in Europe than on the
> ability to sustain armies and fleets across oceans, to coordinate
> distant campaigns, and to turn maritime access into political and
> fiscal endurance."
> — Fred Anderson, *Crucible of War* (2000) (ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-SECONDARY]

Louisiana is thus **recovered** before it is sold—Napoleon secures
retrocession from Spain in 1800 (Treaty of San Ildefonso), intending
to restore a French American empire anchored by Saint-Domingue.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. NAPOLEON'S AMERICAN DESIGN & SAINT-DOMINGUE AS ANCHOR
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Napoleon's plan depends on Saint-Domingue.

Logic:
• Retrocession of Louisiana (1800): part of a design to reassert
  French power in the Americas
• Saint-Domingue as pivot: sugar, New Orleans as outlet, Louisiana
  as continental hinterland and buffer against British/American
  expansion
• 1801–1802: Expedition to Saint-Domingue to crush the revolution
  and restore slavery—Leclerc's campaign fails (yellow fever,
  resistance)
• 1803: Haitian independence imminent; Leclerc dead; Rochambeau
  defeated

Without Saint-Domingue, Louisiana has no strategic function for
France—no sugar, no naval base in the Caribbean, no link between
continent and islands. The design collapses.

Niall Ferguson (ARC–FRANCIA) on empire and the sale:

"Empires require not only territory but the means to hold it—naval
power to control sea lanes, fiscal capacity to fund garrisons and
fleets, and the will to prioritize colonial defense over continental
ambition. France in the eighteenth century repeatedly chose
continental war over colonial investment. The result was that when
Britain applied naval and financial pressure, French overseas empire
collapsed—first in North America, then in the Caribbean. The sale of
Louisiana was the logical conclusion: without Saint-Domingue, the
American remnant had no strategic value, and Napoleon needed cash for
war in Europe."
— Niall Ferguson, *Empire* (2003) (ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-SECONDARY]

Andrew Roberts (ARC–FRANCIA) on the fiscal-military bind:

"The heir to the French Revolution's debts, Napoleon was fighting against
a government fuelled by the Industrial Revolution's profits, which it
was willing to share round in support of its cause."
— Andrew Roberts, *Napoleon: A Life* (New York: Viking, 2014)
(ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-SECONDARY]

Roberts thus frames the **asymmetry** that makes the Louisiana sale
rational: Napoleon needs cash and continental focus; the American
remnant has no strategic value without Saint-Domingue.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. DECISION TO SELL: HAITIAN DEFEAT, CASH, AND WAR
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Napoleon decides to sell in early 1803.

Rationale:
• Haitian defeat: Saint-Domingue cannot be held; Louisiana without
  it is indefensible and uneconomic
• War with Britain imminent (Peace of Amiens collapsing); French
  navy cannot protect Louisiana or reinforce it
• Cash: Napoleon needs funds for continental war—army, fleet,
  coalition-building
• Negotiation with the United States: Jefferson's envoys (Livingston,
  Monroe) had sought only New Orleans and West Florida; Napoleon's
  offer of the entire territory is accepted

The sale is **rational under constraint**—not sentiment, but
strategic and fiscal logic. Francia exits the New World continent
in one transaction.

ARC–DISCOVERY: EXPANDED SEARCH
Source: Jon Kukla, *A Wilderness So Immense* (2003)
Justification: Louisiana Purchase as Franco-American transaction;
no ARC–FRANCIA listed author provides equivalent diplomatic
narrative.

"Napoleon's decision to sell Louisiana was not impulsive. It was the
product of cold calculation: Leclerc's army was dying in Saint-Domingue,
war with Britain was imminent, and the French treasury was empty.
Louisiana without New Orleans and without the Caribbean was a vast
territory that France could neither defend nor develop. Selling it
to the United States removed a liability, secured cash for the
continental war, and deprived Britain of a potential prize. For
France, the sale was the rational end of an American strategy that
had already failed."
— Jon Kukla, *A Wilderness So Immense* (2003) [ERC-SECONDARY]

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. NEGOTIATION AND TREATY (APRIL–DECEMBER 1803)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The deal is concluded quickly.

Sequence:
• April 1803: Barbé-Marbois (French finance minister) and Livingston
  agree on sale of Louisiana to the United States
• Monroe arrives; negotiations confirm terms—$15 million (approx.
  80 million francs); boundaries vague (Louisiana as France had
  received it from Spain)
• May 1803: Treaty signed (retrocession not yet formalized in New
  Orleans—France had not taken physical possession)
• October 1803: French ratification; December 1803: Transfer of
  Louisiana to the United States in New Orleans

Robert Tombs (ARC–FRANCIA) on imperial priority and continental focus:

"When Choiseul negotiated the Treaty of Paris, he chose to keep the
sugar islands rather than Canada. By the economics of the time, this
was rational. Saint-Domingue alone produced more revenue than all of
New France. Sugar was Europe's most valuable commodity; beaver pelts
were not. The decision revealed imperial priorities: profit over
territory, Caribbean over continent."
— Robert Tombs, *France 1814–1914* (1996) (ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-SECONDARY]

The Louisiana Purchase inverts that logic: with the Caribbean anchor
gone, continent is sold—and profit (cash for war) again over
territory.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. CONSEQUENCES FOR FRANCIA
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Purchase ends French continental presence in the New World.

Outcomes:
• Francia's American empire reduced to Caribbean remnants
  (Martinique, Guadeloupe, later French Guiana)—no continental
  dimension
• Cash from the sale funds Napoleonic war in Europe—army, fleet,
  campaigns
• The United States doubles in size; Franco-American relations
  shift—no longer a French buffer against Britain, but an expanding
  republic
• French memory: Louisiana is the "sale that made sense"—rational
  exit, not traumatic loss like Haiti or later Algeria

The Purchase encodes **voluntary exit**—sale, not defeat—but it
is exit nonetheless. The First Empire's American dimension is
closed.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. CONTRAST WITH OTHER LOSSES
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Louisiana Purchase differs from other imperial losses.

Contrasts:
• Canada (1763): lost in war; traded for sugar in treaty
• Saint-Domingue (1804): lost in revolution; military and moral
  defeat
• Louisiana (1803): **sold**—no military defeat on the territory;
  rational disposal of an asset that had lost its function
• Later empire (Indochina, Algeria): lost in war or decolonization;
  not sale

The Purchase is thus the **clean exit**—transactional, not
traumatic—but it is the exit that closes the American chapter.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VIII. CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Louisiana Purchase encodes **empire's rational retreat**.

Lessons:
• Territory without strategic function (Louisiana without
  Saint-Domingue) becomes a liability; sale is rational.
• Cash for continental war trumps overseas possession when naval
  power cannot hold it.
• The Purchase is voluntary exit—sale, not defeat—but it ends
  French continental presence in the New World.
• French memory treats it as the sensible choice—unlike Haiti,
  which remains the unanswerable wound.

The Louisiana Purchase is Francia's American closing act: rational,
transactional, and final.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IX. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Louisiana was recovered (1800) to anchor a Caribbean-centered
  American empire.
• Haitian defeat made Louisiana surplus; sale followed.
• Napoleon needed cash for war; the United States wanted territory.
• The Purchase was rational under constraint—sale, not defeat.
• Francia's continental presence in the New World ended in 1803.
• The Purchase is remembered as sensible exit—unlike Haiti.

Tension preserved without verdict.
