# LEARN Session Report: Napoleonic France (Gated Spiral)

**Date:** 11 Feb 2026  
**Scope:** Doctrine lens CIV–DOCTRINE–FRANCE v3.1 (doctrines 01–05); Napoleonic MEM set (MEM–FRANCIA–NAPOLEON, CONTINENTAL–SYSTEM, WAR–NAPOLEON–WATERLOO, WAR–NAPOLEON–LEIPZIG, FRENCH–REVOLUTION, LAW–NAPOLEONIC–CODE, WAR–TRAFALGAR, and related coalition/revolution MEMs).

## Findings Summary

- Napoleonic MEM set **systematically verifies** doctrines 01–05. No doctrine is contradicted.
- **Doctrine 01 (Declarative Legitimacy):** Declaration precedes enforcement (Code, proclamations, victory as legitimacy); collapse when enforcement lags (1812–1815). NAPOLEON, CODE, WATERLOO (AXIOM FRANCIA-005). Complication: enforcement followed declaration 1800–1810; lag after 1810.
- **Doctrine 02 (Universalism–Capacity):** Universal claims exceeded capacity (Continental System, overextension, Trafalgar → continental substitute; RLL–0016 extent–stability applies). Complication: capacity was real 1805–1810; divergence widened after 1810.
- **Doctrine 03 (Rupture as Renewal):** Revolution → Brumaire; Waterloo as reset/Restoration. Complication: Napoleonic "renewal" was coercive order; 1815 = different grammar (Bourbon).
- **Doctrine 04 (Post-Hegemonic):** Post-Trafalgar continental coercion; Waterloo as terminal rupture; universal language without hegemonic capacity. MEMs encode defeat; doctrine describes post-defeat state (fit).
- **Doctrine 05 (Oscillator):** Full oscillation (Revolution → Consulate → Empire → defeat); war as legitimacy correction; Leipzig defection cascade; Waterloo as last throw. Complication: externalization vs internal reform (plunder/tribute).

## Doctrine Table (Verify / Complicate / Contradict / Gap)

| Doctrine | Verify | Complicate | Contradict | Gap |
|----------|--------|------------|------------|-----|
| 01 Declarative | NAPOLEON, CODE, WATERLOO (AXIOM-005) | Enforcement followed declaration 1800–1810; lag after 1810 | None | None |
| 02 Universalism–Capacity | NAPOLEON, CONTINENTAL–SYSTEM, WATERLOO, TRAFALGAR, FRENCH–REVOLUTION; RLL–0016 | Capacity real 1805–1810; divergence post-1810 | None | None |
| 03 Rupture as Renewal | FRENCH–REVOLUTION, NAPOLEON (Brumaire), WATERLOO (reset) | Napoleonic "renewal" = coercive order; 1815 = different grammar (Bourbon) | None | None |
| 04 Post-Hegemonic | CONTINENTAL–SYSTEM, WATERLOO | MEMs encode defeat; 04 describes post-defeat state (fit) | None | None |
| 05 Oscillator | NAPOLEON, FRENCH–REVOLUTION, WATERLOO, LEIPZIG | Full arc; externalization vs internal reform (plunder/tribute) | None | None |

## Tri-Frame Note

**Question:** Why did Napoleonic legitimacy collapse 1812–1815?

- **Mercouris:** Legitimacy was performance-based and declarative; once victories stopped and the Continental System was seen as unenforceable, the moral claim lost its anchor. Rupture-as-renewal grammar allowed 1815 to be encoded as reset (Restoration) rather than mere defeat.
- **Mearsheimer:** Force ratio and coalition logic. Russia 1812 destroyed the army; defection of satellites (Leipzig) transferred force to coalition; no credit or allies; Waterloo last throw with no margin. Overextension, coalition formation, extraction system collapse.
- **Barnes:** Liability became visible to satellite elites (German princes, casualties); defection rational (destination: coalition). Napoleon concentrated liability; declarative authority bound only while no alternative destination existed (AXIOM FRANCIA-005).

## Gated-Spiral Self-Check

- **Doctrines that governed the analysis:** CIV–DOCTRINE–FRANCE 01–05.
- **Frame-consistent vs frame-challenging:** Findings are **frame-consistent** — they extend and operationalise existing doctrines (Napoleonic arc as canonical test for 02, 04, 05); no finding contradicts a doctrine.
- **Lens awareness:** Findings are doctrine-shaped; the questions asked were framed by the doctrine set.

## Gate 1 Outcome

A — Proceed to WRITE with all proposed categories.

## Gate 2 Outcomes (WRITE Phase)

- **Gate 2a (Doctrine):** Approved. CIV–DOCTRINE–FRANCE v3.2 — Doctrine 02 and 05 operational meaning updated (Napoleonic arc 1799–1815 as canonical test).
- **Gate 2b (RLL):** Approved. RLL–FRANCIA–0017 (CANDIDATE) added — performance-based legitimacy fails when victory stops.
- **Gate 2c (MEM):** Approved all. MEM–FRANCIA–NAPOLEON: continuity insight (extent–stability) + CONNECTIONS to WATERLOO, CONTINENTAL–SYSTEM, TRAFALGAR. MEM–FRANCIA–WAR–NAPOLEON–LEIPZIG: continuity insight (doctrine 05, reset). MEM–FRANCIA–CONTINENTAL–SYSTEM: CONNECTION to TRAFALGAR.
