II. DOCTRINE-BY-DOCTRINE ASSESSMENT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

DOCTRINE 01 — DECLARATIVE LEGITIMACY
Definition: Authority through articulated universal claims, law, symbolism; enforcement must not lag symbolism; moral claims without capacity accelerate loss.

Evidence (30 days):
• VERIFICATION: Executive continues to lead by declaration — Paris Declaration (Élysée, 6 Jan 2026) commits France to “robust security guarantees” for Ukraine, European-led force, binding commitments. Macron stated France provides “two-thirds of the intelligence” Ukraine receives (RFI, 16 Jan). Declaration precedes detailed capacity delivery; symbolism (Paris as peace/security guarantor) is front-loaded.
• VERIFICATION: Budget forced through without full parliamentary vote (Le Monde, 20 Jan 2026). Government used constitutional procedure to pass part of 2026 budget “without a vote,” then survived no-confidence motions (Le Monde, 23 Jan). Law and executive intent precede broad parliamentary consent — consistent with declarative primacy.
• CONTRADICTION: None. Pattern holds: declaration and symbolism lead; capacity (defence spending, intelligence, future troop deployment) is being ramped but follows the stated commitments.

Hard constraint check: “Declarative legitimacy collapses if enforcement lags symbolism.” Not yet triggered in 30-day window — defence budget was adopted (Feb 2026), so funding trajectory aligns with rearmament rhetoric. If delivery (ammunition stocks, readiness, European force) lags timeline, constraint would activate.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

DOCTRINE 02 — UNIVERSALISM–CAPACITY DIVERGENCE
Definition: When universal claims exceed material, fiscal, or military capacity, legitimacy decays faster than territory. Overextension → elite fracture; capacity gaps convert victory into exhaustion.

Evidence (30 days):
• VERIFICATION: France has raised universalist stakes (Ukraine security guarantees, “coalition of the willing,” readiness to deploy troops post-ceasefire) while domestic political base is weak. Trust in “politics” ~22%, in parties ~15%, in Macron ~18%, in National Assembly ~20% (Brussels Signal citing CEVIPOF barometer, Feb 2026; Le Monde, 10 Feb — voters “turn inward”). Elite–public gap is wide; non-political institutions (army, hospitals, police) retain much higher trust. This fits “universalism creates escalation pressure” and “capacity shortfalls expose moral claims.”
• VERIFICATION: Government ended lifetime perks for former ministers (RFI, 1 Jan 2026) “amid growing voter mistrust” — reactive move to narrow credibility gap. Parliamentary battle over budget and no-confidence motions suggest elite fracture risk (opposition piling pressure; Le Monde, 9 Jan, 23 Jan).
• CONTRADICTION: None. Divergence is present: high-level commitments (Ukraine, European defence “revolution”) alongside historically low trust and legislative friction. Doctrine predicts “overextension produces elite fracture” — not yet full fracture but pressure is consistent.

Hard constraint check: “Capacity gaps convert victory into exhaustion.” Too early to assess; no “victory” in period. “Universal missions require disproportionate enforcement” — deployment pledges (e.g. “several thousand” troops post-ceasefire) are conditional and not yet executed; if executed without commensurate public and fiscal buy-in, constraint would bite.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

DOCTRINE 03 — RUPTURE AS RENEWAL
Definition: Regime collapse, revolution, or rupture treated as legitimate corrective. Collapse reframed as purification; continuity is moral, not institutional. Hard constraint: repeated rupture degrades institutional memory; renewal without consolidation invites recurrence.

Evidence (30 days):
• VERIFICATION: No new regime rupture in 30 days. Pattern remains available in political culture: use of constitutional shortcuts (budget without vote) and survival of no-confidence votes show system stress-tested but not broken. Polls show significant minorities favour “stronger central authority” or “military rule” (Brussels Signal/CEVIPOF) — consistent with latent willingness to entertain non-incremental change (rupture as thinkable option).
• NEUTRAL: No event in window that either confirms or contradicts. Doctrine is about grammar of how rupture is encoded when it occurs, not frequency. If a future crisis were reframed as “renewal” or “purification,” that would verify; absence of rupture in 30 days does not contradict.

Hard constraint check: “Renewal without consolidation invites recurrence.” Current phase is consolidation attempt (defence budget, institutional perks cut) rather than renewal narrative; no test of this constraint in window.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

DOCTRINE 04 — POST-HEGEMONIC STRATEGIC ANXIETY
Definition: After hegemonic defeat, loss internalised → defensive strategy, alliance dependence, rigidity masked by universalist rhetoric. Hard constraint: anxiety hardens doctrine; rigidity replaces adaptation; universal language persists without hegemonic capacity.

Evidence (30 days):
• VERIFICATION: France is doubling down on European defence and NATO European pillar while asserting leadership (Paris summit, security guarantees, “European revolution” in defence per 2025 National Strategic Review). Mix of “alliance dependence” (US ceasefire monitoring lead, NATO framework) and “European strategic autonomy” rhetoric (Foreign Policy, 28 Jan 2026 — “rearmament paradox”). Fits “alliances substitute for sovereignty” and “past defeat governs present posture” — post-1945 and post-colonial anxiety underpin both EU embedding and insistence on sovereign nuclear and intelligence roles.
• VERIFICATION: Macron’s rearmament narrative (“major engagement within three to four years,” €36bn boost, readiness) is rigid in timeline and ambition — “anxiety hardens doctrine” is consistent. Universal language (peace, security guarantees, European solidarity) persists while French capacity to unilaterally enforce remains limited; European and US coordination is required.
• CONTRADICTION: None. Pattern holds: defensive/loss-avoidant posture wrapped in universalist framing; reliance on coalition and US for ceasefire mechanism; French “leadership” expressed through declarations and intelligence provision rather than unilateral hegemonic capacity.

Hard constraint check: “Rigidity replaces adaptation.” Budget and defence timeline are rigid; adaptation (e.g. to parliamentary resistance) took form of constitutional shortcut rather than policy compromise — consistent with rigidity.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

DOCTRINE 05 — LEGITIMACY–CAPACITY OSCILLATOR
Definition: Recurrent oscillation between asserted legitimacy and enforceable capacity; divergence resolved through external war, defeat, or regime reset. War as legitimacy correction; externalisation substitutes for internal reform.

Evidence (30 days):
• VERIFICATION: Government is prioritising external/defence policy (Ukraine guarantees, rearmament, European force) while domestic legitimacy is at historic lows. This fits “externalization substitutes for internal reform” — emphasis on war readiness and European security as a form of legitimacy investment rather than deep domestic institutional or trust repair (beyond symbolic moves like ending ministerial perks).
• VERIFICATION: Defence spending surge (+13% in 2026 budget, €36bn extra to 2030) and high-visibility international summit (Paris) align with “war is used as legitimacy correction” and “victory restores credibility” — the state is betting on external role and rearmament to shore up purpose and credibility.
• CONTRADICTION: None. No new “defeat” or “regime reset” in window; the oscillator is in the phase of reasserting legitimacy via external commitment and military investment. If domestic trust continues to fall while external commitments grow, doctrine predicts eventual correction (defeat, reset, or reform) — not yet observed in 30 days.

Hard constraint check: “Oscillation increases cumulative war exposure.” France is increasing exposure (troop deployment pledge, intelligence lead, European force commitment). “Repeated cycles erode long-term strategic patience” — not testable in 30 days.

III. SUMMARY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

| Doctrine | Verification | Contradiction | Hard constraint (30-day) |
|----------|--------------|---------------|---------------------------|
| 01 Declarative Legitimacy | Yes — declaration leads; budget/vote shortcut | No | Not triggered; delivery pending |
| 02 Universalism–Capacity Divergence | Yes — high claims, low trust; elite–public gap | No | Pressure consistent; no full fracture yet |
| 03 Rupture as Renewal | Neutral (no rupture in window) | No | Not tested |
| 04 Post-Hegemonic Strategic Anxiety | Yes — alliance + autonomy rhetoric; rigidity | No | Holds |
| 05 Legitimacy–Capacity Oscillator | Yes — externalisation vs internal reform | No | Exposure increasing; cycle phase consistent |

Overall: No contradictions. Doctrines 01, 02, 04, 05 are verified or consistent with observed behaviour in the past 30 days. Doctrine 03 is not tested in this window. Evidence is suitable for STATE–FRANCE Section VII (Decision-Relevant History) and for stability/credibility-gap indicators (Section VI).

IV. PRE-1900 HISTORICAL EXAMPLES (MEM-GROUNDED)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Specific pre-1900 cases from the FRANCIA MEM corpus that verify each doctrine. All citations from MEM files; ARC sources as noted in those MEMs.

DOCTRINE 01 — DECLARATIVE LEGITIMACY
• **Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen (1789)** — Legitimacy by proclamation; authority derived from principle and nation, not king or past. "Legitimacy is asserted before capacity exists"; no institutional architecture or enforcement mechanism in the Declaration itself (MEM–FRANCIA–DECLARATION–RIGHTS–MAN). Will Durant: "It was legitimacy by proclamation—the assertion that authority flows from the nation and from natural law."
• **Louis XIV (1638–1715)** — Authority stabilised by representation and spectacle; law as royal will; Versailles as governance machine that "absorbed all authority" through ritual and elite domestication (Saint-Simon, MEM–FRANCIA–LOUIS–XIV). Declaration and symbolism precede capacity; absolutism as "systematic political technology."
• **Revolution of 1848** — Second Republic "proclaimed before the institutions to sustain it existed"; Lamartine: "The Republic was not established by force of arms but by the irresistible force of public opinion, which proclaimed it before..." (MEM–FRANCIA–REVOLUTION–1848). Legitimacy evaporates faster than force—"The monarchy had ceased to be believed in before it ceased to be obeyed."

DOCTRINE 02 — UNIVERSALISM–CAPACITY DIVERGENCE
• **Seven Years' War (1756–1763)** — "Decisive global legitimacy shock": divergence between universalist ambition and enforceable capacity. Loss of Canada and French India; Choiseul: "We have lost America not in the forests of Canada, but on the seas, where we were never strong enough to contest England's mastery." Multi-theatre overextension; "global reach becomes operational strain rather than advantage" (MEM–FRANCIA–WAR–SEVEN–YEARS; Anderson, *Crucible of War*).
• **Revolution of 1848** — Ferguson (ARC): "Legitimacy without credit was as unsustainable in 1848 as it had been in 1789." Universalist shock without material resolution; republican declaration surged faster than administrative capacity or coercive coherence (MEM–FRANCIA–REVOLUTION–1848).
• **French Revolution (1789–1799)** — Ferguson: "Once the revolutionaries inherited the debt, they discovered that legitimacy without credit was as unsustainable as credit without legitimacy." Universalism as revolutionary engine; rights precede institutions; legitimacy decay faster than institutions adapt (MEM–FRANCIA–FRENCH–REVOLUTION).

DOCTRINE 03 — RUPTURE AS RENEWAL
• **French Revolution (1789)** — "Legitimacy detonation"; universalist moral claims replace inherited authority at once. "The Revolution is not reform. It is reset." Rupture reframed as purification; continuity is moral, not institutional (MEM–FRANCIA–FRENCH–REVOLUTION). Rousseau's grammar of legitimate rupture.
• **Jacquerie of 1358** — "Rupture as popular corrective—and then rupture suppressed." Post-Poitiers vacuum (royal defeat, captivity); peasant and urban revolt against noble authority; royal reassertion through suppression. Encodes popular refusal as legitimate corrective within Francia's medieval grammar (MEM–FRANCIA–JACQUERIE; Firnhaber-Baker).
• **Revolution of 1848** — February collapse of July Monarchy; Second Republic proclaimed; rupture as moral assertion. "Revealed mismatch" when army restored order before revolution could institutionalise—renewal without consolidation (MEM–FRANCIA–REVOLUTION–1848).

DOCTRINE 04 — POST-HEGEMONIC STRATEGIC ANXIETY
• **Waterloo (18 June 1815)** — "Terminal legitimacy rupture"; "exhaustion made visible." Napoleonic era terminates; Second Restoration; Congress system. Francia's defeat is irreversible—no satellites, no extraction; defeat is Francia's own. Encodes post-hegemonic imprint: alliance dependence and rigidity to follow (MEM–FRANCIA–WAR–NAPOLEON–WATERLOO).
• **Continental System (1806–1814)** — Post-Trafalgar (1805): "Sea failure produces continental coercion." Napoleon cannot contest British naval supremacy; imposes Berlin Decree and closed economic space. "Coercive substitute for maritime power"—defensive improvisation under structural loss (MEM–FRANCIA–CONTINENTAL–SYSTEM). Universal language (continental order) without hegemonic maritime capacity.
• **Thirty Years' War (1618–1648) / Richelieu** — After Wars of Religion, state survival overrides theological consistency; *raison d'état* as higher-order legitimacy. "Interests of the state must come before all else." Secular universalism (balance, not belief) as response to confessional fragmentation; alliance and subsidy warfare to limit exposure (MEM–FRANCIA–WAR–THIRTY–YEARS, MEM–FRANCIA–RICHELIEU).

DOCTRINE 05 — LEGITIMACY–CAPACITY OSCILLATOR
• **French Revolution → Napoleonic Wars** — Revolution asserts legitimacy by principle; fiscal collapse and war (First Coalition, etc.) as legitimacy correction; victory (Austerlitz, Jena) restores credibility; defeat (Leipzig, Waterloo) enables reset (Restoration). "War is used as legitimacy correction" (MEM–FRANCIA–FRENCH–REVOLUTION, MEM–FRANCIA–WAR–NAPOLEON–WATERLOO).
• **Seven Years' War** — Oscillation: post-Louis XIV prestige maintenance without structural reform; war as attempt to preserve great-power status; defeat reveals divergence; postwar Choiseul reform as partial correction. "Externalization substitutes for internal reform" until defeat forces diagnosis (MEM–FRANCIA–WAR–SEVEN–YEARS).
• **1848** — Revolution as legitimacy surge; no fiscal-military answer; army restores order. "Conflict frequency rises independently of necessity"; revolution as attempted correction; failure to institutionalise leads to Second Empire—cycle continues (MEM–FRANCIA–REVOLUTION–1848).

Summary (pre-1900): Each doctrine is supported by at least two MEM-grounded examples with dates, actors, and mechanisms. Doctrine 01: Declaration 1789, Louis XIV, 1848. Doctrine 02: Seven Years' War, 1848, Revolution 1789. Doctrine 03: Revolution 1789, Jacquerie 1358, 1848. Doctrine 04: Waterloo 1815, Continental System 1806–1814, Thirty Years' War/Richelieu. Doctrine 05: Revolution–Napoleonic arc, Seven Years' War, 1848.

V. RECOMMENDED STATE–FRANCE UPDATES (OPTIONAL)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

• Section VI (Stability Indicators): Consider setting Credibility Gap (CG) to WIDENING and Legitimacy Reservoir (LR) to MED, with evidence: trust in politics/parties/Macron/Assembly (15–22%); contrast with army/hospitals/police (60–79%). Source: CEVIPOF barometer (Feb 2026), Le Monde (Feb 2026).
• Section VII (Decision-Relevant History): Add one-line pattern activation: “Doctrine check (11 Feb 2026, ARC-sourced) | Doctrines 01, 02, 04, 05 verified or consistent; 03 untested | File: STATE–FRANCE–DOCTRINE–CHECK–ARC–2026–02–11.md | Precedent: CIV–DOCTRINE–FRANCE v3.0.”
• Material options (Section IV): When populated, stress-test Option A/B/C against Doctrine 02 (universalism–capacity) and 05 (externalisation vs internal reform) — e.g. options that assume high domestic legitimacy or downplay credibility gap should note doctrine risk.

VII. FURTHER VERIFICATION — CAPET DYNASTY ONLY (987–1328)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Historical examples drawn **only** from MEMs that treat the Capetian dynasty (987–1328) or events squarely within that period. No post-1328 Valois/Bourbon/Revolution examples in this section.

Sources: MEM–FRANCIA–DYNASTY–CAPET; MEM–FRANCIA–REIMS–CATHEDRAL; MEM–FRANCIA–PARIS; MEM–FRANCIA–WAR–CRUSADES; MEM–FRANCIA–KNIGHTS–TEMPLAR; MEM–FRANCIA–ELEANOR–AQUITAINE.

DOCTRINE 01 — DECLARATIVE LEGITIMACY
• **Sacral kingship and coronation (Capetian)** — Legitimacy flows from anointing and ritual, not from territorial control alone. "Le roi ne meurt jamais" (the king never dies): continuity is asserted symbolically. Reims Cathedral (construction from 1211): "Gothic architecture became sacral technology: the cathedral concentrated legitimacy, binding crown, city, and God in stone. The building was not merely religious; it was the monarchy's memory made visible" (Firnhaber-Baker, MEM–FRANCIA–REIMS–CATHEDRAL). Authority stabilised by representation; declaration (coronation oath, anointing) precedes and sustains obedience.
• **Paris as Capetian core** — "Paris rising as the symbolic and administrative core of a realm that had learned to outlast rivals" (Firnhaber-Baker, MEM–FRANCIA–PARIS). Legitimacy made spatial; crown, God, and administration concentrated in one place. Symbolic centrality asserted before full territorial consolidation.
• **Philip IV and the Templars (1307–1314)** — The trial "was not theological. It was jurisdictional. The issue is not belief. It is who commands authority inside Francia." Firnhaber-Baker: "Philip IV did not destroy them for heresy; he destroyed them to assert sovereignty." Crown **declares** that no authority within territory may stand outside royal command; enforcement (arrests, seizure) follows declaration (MEM–FRANCIA–KNIGHTS–TEMPLAR).

DOCTRINE 02 — UNIVERSALISM–CAPACITY DIVERGENCE
• **Crusades (1095–1291, French/Capetian participation)** — "Identity before sovereignty." French nobility and later Capetian kings (e.g. Louis IX) project universalist religious claims (holy war, protector of faith) while feudal coordination and logistical capacity lag. Joinville (Louis IX's companion): "The king's army was never so well ordered that the battalions could not be broken by the rush of a handful of men." Military outcome: strategic defeat (Acre falls 1291); civilizational outcome: "myth and legitimacy legacy." Universal claims (Christendom's sword) exceed enforceable capacity; legitimacy gains are retrospective, not territorial (MEM–FRANCIA–WAR–CRUSADES).
• **Eleanor of Aquitaine and Louis VII (1137–1152)** — Capetians absorb Aquitaine by marriage (legitimacy through union); they do not conquer it. Marriage brings the duchy "under French royal orbit—in theory." Annulment (1152): Eleanor retains Aquitaine; Capetians lose it. "Capetians lose the duchy—rupture by repudiation." Universal claim to hold the south (dynastic union) exceeds capacity to sustain it; loss of Aquitaine to Plantagenets becomes the territorial stake of centuries of conflict (MEM–FRANCIA–ELEANOR–AQUITAINE).

DOCTRINE 03 — RUPTURE AS RENEWAL
• **Capetian strategy: continuity instead of rupture** — The dynasty "did not conquer by explosion but by patience—outlasting rivals, absorbing fiefs" (Firnhaber-Baker, MEM–FRANCIA–DYNASTY–CAPET). Doctrine 03 encodes rupture as **legitimate corrective** when legitimacy decays; the Capetians illustrate the **avoidance** of rupture through restraint. "The dynasty ended without collapse"; "state continuity outlived the dynasty itself." Rupture is not invoked; renewal is incremental (institutional foundations, legal absorption). Contrast: when the Templars—a sacral order with "authority without territory"—threaten sovereign coherence, Philip IV **imposes** rupture on them (1307), reframing their elimination as restoration of royal order (MEM–FRANCIA–KNIGHTS–TEMPLAR). Rupture applied to a competing node, not to the crown.
• **Crusade myth as post-defeat renewal** — After Acre (1291), territorial crusading ends in defeat. "The Crusades become retrospective legitimacy fuel"; "kings claim protector-of-faith role"; "crusading rhetoric becomes state instrument" (MEM–FRANCIA–WAR–CRUSADES). Defeat is reframed: not as failure but as myth that strengthens monarchy. Continuity is moral (we are still Christendom's sword), not territorial.

DOCTRINE 04 — POST-HEGEMONIC STRATEGIC ANXIETY
• **Post–Holy Land (1291) and Templar suppression** — After the fall of Acre, the Templars retain "wealth, immunity, privilege" but "lose mission clarity. Sacral authority without purpose becomes politically naked." The French crown, by the early 14th century, has "centralized fiscal extraction" and "sovereignty claims over all authority within territory." The Templars appear as "competing legitimacy node." Philip IV's destruction of the Order (1307–1314) is defensive consolidation: eliminate authority that cannot be subordinated. "Papal supremacy is revealed as conditional"; "universalism must now submit to sovereignty" (MEM–FRANCIA–KNIGHTS–TEMPLAR). Post–crusade loss, strategy hardens around territorial sovereignty; rigidity (no competing authority) replaces adaptation (tolerating the Order).
• **Crusades and later royal posture** — Wilson: "By the time the last Latin outposts fell, the French crown had learned to domesticate crusading rhetoric—to turn it from noble adventure into royal policy. The protector of the faith was no longer the knight errant but the king." Post-defeat, alliance with Church and royal monopoly on holy violence substitute for noble-led expedition; "past defeat governs present posture" (MEM–FRANCIA–WAR–CRUSADES).

DOCTRINE 05 — LEGITIMACY–CAPACITY OSCILLATOR
• **Crusades: myth after defeat** — Noble-led holy war (legitimacy through sacred violence); repeated campaigns; territorial defeat (1291). Divergence resolved by **absorption**: crown appropriates crusade as royal narrative (Louis IX sanctity; "Most Christian King"). "War is used as legitimacy correction"; victory in myth restores credibility after victory in the field fails (MEM–FRANCIA–WAR–CRUSADES).
• **Eleanor/Aquitaine: union then loss** — Legitimacy asserted through marriage (1137); capacity to hold Aquitaine fails (Louis VII's reign, annulment 1152). Oscillation: legitimacy through union → capacity fails (loss of duchy) → Plantagenets gain; French crown retains suzerainty claim (legal) without control (operational). The contradiction "drives the Hundred Years' War." Externalisation (claim over Aquitaine) persists without internal reform of Capetian capacity to enforce it (MEM–FRANCIA–ELEANOR–AQUITAINE).

Summary (Capet only): Doctrines 01, 02, 04, 05 are verified by Capet-era examples (sacral declaration, Crusade/Aquitaine capacity gaps, post-1291 hardening, crusade myth and Eleanor oscillation). Doctrine 03 is verified indirectly: Capetians avoid rupture by patience and outlasting; when they do impose rupture, it is on a competitor (Templars) to restore sovereign order. All examples fall within or directly concern 987–1328 (Capet) or events under Capetian kings (Crusades, Reims, Paris, Templars, Eleanor–Louis VII).
