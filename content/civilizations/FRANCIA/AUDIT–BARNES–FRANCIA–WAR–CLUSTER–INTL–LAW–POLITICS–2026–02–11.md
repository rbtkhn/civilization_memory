# Barnes Cognition Audit: Francia WAR Cluster
## International Law and Politics

**Date:** 11 February 2026  
**Mode:** SCHOLAR LEARN  
**Lens:** Barnes (liability, mechanism, constraint hierarchy)  
**Focus:** International law and politics — jurisdiction, treaty, personal liability, who is on the hook, legitimacy of settlement.  
**Scope:** Francia WAR MEM cluster + MEM–FRANCIA–TREATY–FRANKFURT.

---

## I. Executive Summary

One issue is jurisdiction—who had compulsory authority to declare war, sign peace, and cede territory across these MEMs. The second is personal liability—who actually faces exposure when the treaty gets signed or the regime collapses. And the third is that most of the WAR cluster doesn’t name the treaty, the signatories, or the mechanism of obligation at all. So you get a lot of “war happened, then legitimacy shifted,” and almost nothing that says “this party signed, this party ratified, this party is bound.” The exception is TREATY–FRANKFURT, which does the job. The rest of the cluster is thin on international law and politics when you run the Barnes checklist. That’s the reality of it.

## II. Constraint Hierarchy Applied

### 0. Constitutional grounding

Most WAR MEMs don’t say who had *authority* under what law or constitution to wage war or make peace. Franco–Prussian: Napoleon III declares war as Emperor; after Sedan there’s a vacuum—Government of National Defence, then Thiers, then Assembly. So at the moment of Frankfurt, who had the constitutional right to bind France? The MEMs don’t spell it out. Thirty Years: Westphalia codifies sovereign equality—so the *system* gets a constitutional layer; the MEM stresses legitimacy innovation, not who signed for which prince. Spanish Succession: Utrecht/Rastatt—the MEM says “Bourbon retained on Spanish throne; permanent separation of crowns” but doesn’t name plenipotentiaries or ratification. Seven Years: Paris 1763 isn’t named in the MEM; Choiseul is quoted for diagnosis (“we lost America on the seas”), not for signing. So constitutional or treaty-making authority is under-specified across the cluster.

### 1. Jurisdiction — Who has compulsory authority?

- **Franco–Prussian / Frankfurt:** TREATY–FRANKFURT and FRANCO–PRUSSIAN together give you: Napoleon III had authority until captured; then the Republic (Thiers, Assembly) signs. So jurisdiction *transfers* from Emperor to Republic mid-war. The treaty MEM is the only one that explicitly says who signed (Thiers government, German Empire) and who ratified. That’s the standard the cluster could aim for.
- **Thirty Years:** Westphalia is framed as *legitimacy codification* (sovereign equality, balance of power). The MEM doesn’t treat it as a treaty with parties and obligations—it treats it as rule-making. So “who had jurisdiction” is answered at the system level (states), not at the “who signed for France” level.
- **Spanish Succession:** “Treaties of Utrecht / Rastatt” get a bullet list (Bourbon on Spanish throne, separation of crowns, territorial concessions). No parties table, no signatories, no ratification. So you don’t know who had compulsory authority to bind France—you infer Crown.
- **Seven Years:** Paris 1763 is the peace. The MEM discusses Choiseul’s *diagnosis* (maritime failure) and fiscal aftermath; it doesn’t name the Treaty of Paris or who signed for France. So jurisdiction is implied (Crown) but not stated.
- **Waterloo:** Layer 2 says “Settlement: Second Treaty of Paris, Napoleon exiled to St. Helena.” So you get the outcome, but the MEM doesn’t name who signed for France (restored Bourbon government) or the liability chain. Napoleon bears *personal* liability (exile); the state bears treaty liability. The split isn’t spelled out.

**Gap:** Only TREATY–FRANKFURT makes jurisdiction and parties explicit. The other WAR MEMs leave treaty-making authority implicit or unnamed.

### 2. Personal liability — Who faces exposure?

- **1870–1871:** Napoleon III is on the hook for the decision to fight and for Sedan; he doesn’t sign the peace, so he escapes *contractual* liability. Thiers and the Assembly sign and perform—so they carry contractual and political liability. TREATY–FRANKFURT distinguishes “legal and contractual liability” (state bound by signature) from “legitimacy liability” (who is blamed in civilizational narrative). That’s the right move. No other MEM in the cluster does it.
- **Thirty Years:** Richelieu and raison d’état—the MEM assigns *civilizational* innovation to the Cardinal; it doesn’t ask who would be liable if Westphalia had been breached or repudiated. So personal liability is not in frame.
- **Spanish Succession:** Louis XIV “placed his grandson on the Spanish throne”; “his successors inherited the bill.” So the liability is dynastic and personal (the King), but the MEM doesn’t name who signed Utrecht or who would be blamed for cessions.
- **Seven Years:** Fiscal memorandum (1763) says “the authority of the Crown will be blamed for necessities it cannot escape.” So *Crown* is the liable institution; no named minister or signatory.
- **Waterloo:** Napoleon is exiled—personal liability executed by the Coalition. The MEM doesn’t say who signed the Second Treaty of Paris for France or who bore obligation to perform (e.g., indemnity, occupation).

**Gap:** Personal liability is clearest in Franco–Prussian / Frankfurt (Napoleon III vs Thiers/Assembly). Elsewhere it’s either dynastic/Crown or absent.

### 3. Defection incentive — Who benefits from exiting first?

The WAR cluster is not built around defection in the treaty sense (who exits the obligation first). Defection shows up in coalition logic (Sixth Coalition, satellites leaving Napoleon)—that’s in the Napoleonic MEMs and the second-pass Mearsheimer readings, not in the international-law layer. So for *treaty* performance (who pays, who withdraws, who repudiates), the cluster doesn’t model defection. Frankfurt: France paid early to get occupiers out—that’s performance, not defection. Revanche is deferred non-performance in *legitimacy* terms, not in contract terms.

### 4. Institutional survival — Does institution gain or die?

- **Third Republic:** Survives by *executing* Frankfurt (paying indemnity, accepting territorial loss). So the institution that signs survives by performing. TREATY–FRANKFURT and FRANCO–PRUSSIAN together encode that.
- **Westphalia:** Francia emerges as rule-maker; the state gains by defining norms. So institution gains.
- **Utrecht:** “Containment replaces confrontation”; Francia is checked, not broken. So institution survives with reduced reach.
- **Paris 1763:** Crown and state survive; fiscal credibility and imperial reach erode. So institution survives, authority erodes.

The cluster does encode institutional survival or erosion; it rarely ties that explicitly to *treaty obligation* (perform or die) except in the 1871 case.

### 5. Irreversibility — What cannot be undone?

- **Territorial cession:** Alsace–Lorraine (1871) is reversed in 1918. So not irreversible in the long run—but in French memory the *humiliation* is irreversible. TREATY–FRANKFURT notes that.
- **Napoleon’s exile:** Permanent; he doesn’t return. So personal outcome is irreversible.
- **Canada / India (1763):** Ceded; not recovered by France. So for Francia that’s irreversible.
- **Westphalia:** The norms (sovereign equality, balance) are treated as durable; the treaty itself isn’t “undone” in the MEMs.

So irreversibility is sometimes territorial, sometimes personal, sometimes normative—but the cluster doesn’t consistently ask “what did the treaty make irreversible?” except implicitly.

## III. International Law and Politics — What’s There, What’s Missing

**What’s there:**

- **TREATY–FRANKFURT:** Parties, settlement type (Diktat), enforcement (occupation), closure capacity, territorial provisions, and a clear split between legal/contractual liability (state) and legitimacy liability (who is blamed). That’s the only MEM that reads like an international-law-and-politics object. It also surfaces cross-civilizational encoding (Francia vs Germania on the same text).
- **Franco–Prussian:** Regime collapse, capture of Emperor, succession to Republic, then treaty. So you get the *sequence* that makes jurisdiction and liability interesting (who signs when the regime has just changed).
- **Thirty Years:** Westphalia as legitimacy codification—so international *order* and norms, not treaty mechanics.
- **Spanish Succession:** Utrecht/Rastatt as outcome (containment, separation of crowns)—no treaty structure.
- **Seven Years:** Fiscal and strategic aftermath; no Treaty of Paris in the narrative.
- **Waterloo:** Second Treaty of Paris and exile in Layer 2; no signatories or obligation chain.

**What’s missing:**

- **Treaty naming and parties:** Most WAR MEMs don’t name the peace treaty that ended the war or who signed for each side. So you can’t run “who is bound?” without going outside the MEM.
- **Jus ad bellum / declaration of war:** No MEM asks whether the war was legally declared, who had authority to declare, or how that authority was contested. Franco–Prussian (Ems Dispatch, casus belli) is the obvious candidate—and there’s no MEM–FRANCIA–EMS–DISPATCH in the cluster yet (it was proposed in the session).
- **Occupation and armistice:** Frankfurt MEM has occupation as enforcement mechanism; the WAR MEMs don’t generally discuss occupation law or armistice as a distinct legal step.
- **Plebiscite and cession legitimacy:** TREATY–FRANKFURT notes “cession without plebiscite” and legitimacy never accepted. That’s the only place the cluster flags the *legitimacy of the transfer* as an international-law/politics question.
- **Successor state obligation:** When the Third Republic signs Frankfurt, it’s a successor to the Second Empire. The MEM doesn’t frame that as successor-state responsibility in so many words—but it does say the Republic “inherited” the obligation. So the idea is there; the legal label isn’t.

## IV. Gaps and Recommendations (Barnes View)

One issue is that if you want to use this cluster to teach or audit *international law and politics*—who has jurisdiction, who signed, who is on the hook, what’s reversible—you’ve got one MEM that does it (TREATY–FRANKFURT) and a lot of WAR MEMs that don’t. So the cluster is lopsided. Then the second is personal liability: except for 1870–1871, you don’t get “this person signed, this person is exposed.” It’s Crown, or regime, or “France.” And the third is that treaty *mechanism*—parties, ratification, enforcement—is absent from most wars. Name me the law that says every WAR MEM has to name the peace treaty. There isn’t one. But if the point is to support a Barnes-style international law and politics audit, then the cluster would benefit from (a) naming the peace treaty and signatories in each WAR MEM where a treaty exists, or (b) adding a dedicated TREATY MEM for other major settlements (e.g., Westphalia, Utrecht, Paris 1763, Second Paris 1815) with Layer 2 treaty data and liability. Right now Frankfurt is the only one that’s got the full treatment. That’s the reality of it.

**Optional enhancements (no file changes in LEARN):**

- Add a one-line “Settlement” bullet to WAR MEMs that currently omit it: e.g., “Peace: Treaty of Paris 1763; France cedes Canada and French India; Choiseul.” Same idea for Utrecht, Westphalia (as treaty), Second Paris 1815.
- Consider MEM–FRANCIA–EMS–DISPATCH (or equivalent) to capture casus belli and responsibility for escalation—mechanism and liability in the run-up to war.
- When new TREATY MEMs are created (e.g., Westphalia, Utrecht), use TREATY–FRANKFURT as the template: parties, classification, closure capacity, who bears liability, legitimacy vs contractual.

## V. Coherence Check (International Law Lens)

| Dimension | Coherent across cluster? | Note |
|-----------|--------------------------|------|
| Jurisdiction | Partial | Only Frankfurt makes parties and signatories explicit. Others imply Crown/state. |
| Personal liability | Partial | Clear for 1870–1871 (Napoleon III vs Thiers). Elsewhere dynastic or absent. |
| Treaty as mechanism | No | Most WAR MEMs don’t name treaty or obligation chain. |
| Legitimacy of settlement | Partial | Frankfurt and Alsace–LORRAINE treat legitimacy of cession; others don’t. |
| Defection (treaty) | Largely absent | Cluster doesn’t model treaty defection or repudiation. |
| Institutional survival | Yes | MEMs encode regime/state survival or erosion; link to treaty performance only in 1871. |

So the cluster is *not* coherent as an international-law-and-politics corpus. It’s coherent as a war-and-legitimacy corpus. TREATY–FRANKFURT is the outlier that raises the bar. Period.
