I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves Waterloo as **Francia's terminal legitimacy rupture**:
the decisive moment when Bonapartist charisma, military virtuosity, and
universalist ambition finally exceeded Francia's material, diplomatic,
and moral capacity.

For Francia, Waterloo is not merely defeat.
It is **exhaustion made visible**.

Unlike Leipzig (system collapse through defection cascade), Waterloo is
fought with a reconstituted French army—no satellite forces, no extraction
from others. The defeat is Francia's own, not the collapse of a hegemonic
system. This makes it irreversible.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. STRATEGIC CONTEXT: THE HUNDRED DAYS GAMBLE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Napoleon's return from Elba is a strategic gamble with no margin for error.

Conditions:
• Coalition armies converging from all directions
• French army reconstituted but smaller (~125,000 for campaign)
• No allies—all former satellites now hostile
• Domestic support uncertain (Bourbon legitimists, war-weary populace)
• Only victory can sustain the restored regime

David G. Chandler frames the strategic imperative:

"The Waterloo campaign was Napoleon's last throw of the dice. Unlike 1813
or 1814, there would be no chance to recover from defeat. The coalition
had learned its lesson: this time there would be no negotiation, no
armistice, no return from exile. Napoleon understood this. His only
chance was to defeat the allied armies in Belgium before they could
concentrate, knock Britain out of the war, and hope that a quick victory
would fracture the coalition. It was a desperate strategy, but it was
the only strategy available."
— David G. Chandler, *The Campaigns of Napoleon* (1966)

The Hundred Days is AXIOM FRANCIA-003 (rupture enables renewal) tested
to destruction. Napoleon attempts one final rupture-to-renewal cycle;
Waterloo terminates the possibility.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. THE BATTLE: FROM THE SOLDIER'S PERSPECTIVE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
John Keegan's *The Face of Battle* provides unique insight into Waterloo's
human dimension—the experience of men under fire.

The infantry's experience:

"At Waterloo, the French infantry attacked in column, as they had done
successfully for twenty years. But at Waterloo, the columns met something
different: disciplined British line infantry that held its fire until
the last moment, then delivered devastating volleys into the dense
French formations. The mathematics were simple: a battalion in line
could bring every musket to bear; a battalion in column could fire only
with its front ranks. The French columns, which had broken Austrian and
Prussian squares across Europe, dissolved under fire they could not
effectively return."
— John Keegan, *The Face of Battle* (1976)

The cavalry's experience:

"The great French cavalry charges at Waterloo—Ney's desperate attempts
to break the British squares—represented a misunderstanding of what
cavalry could achieve against unbroken infantry. For hours, the French
horsemen rode between the squares, slashing at bayonets they could not
reach, taking fire they could not escape. The squares held because the
infantry inside them held their nerve. It was a test of collective
discipline against individual courage, and discipline won."
— John Keegan, *The Face of Battle* (1976)

Keegan reveals that Waterloo was decided not by generalship alone but
by the endurance of ordinary soldiers in formations that held.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. NEY'S CAVALRY CHARGES: TACTICAL FAILURE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The afternoon cavalry attacks represent a critical error.

Sequence:
• 4:00 PM: Ney interprets Wellington's repositioning as retreat
• 4:00-6:00 PM: Unsupported cavalry charges against intact squares
• No infantry or artillery coordination
• French cavalry exhausted without breaking British line

Andrew Roberts explains the failure:

"Ney's cavalry charges at Waterloo were tactically catastrophic. He
committed the French heavy cavalry—5,000 horsemen in the first wave,
eventually 9,000—against British infantry squares without infantry
support and with inadequate artillery preparation. The squares held.
The cavalry rode between them, around them, but could not break them.
By the time the charges ended, the French cavalry was spent, and the
decisive arm that might have exploited a breakthrough no longer existed."
— Andrew Roberts, *Napoleon: A Life* (2014)

The error is not Napoleon's—Ney acted without orders. But the system
that produced Ney's judgment is Napoleon's. Marshal quality had declined
through attrition; the Grande Armée's institutional memory was depleted.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. THE PRUSSIAN ARRIVAL: FORCE-RATIO INVERSION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The battle's outcome is determined by coalition coordination.

Timeline:
• 4:30 PM: Prussian advance guard engages French right
• 6:00 PM: Blücher's main body arrives
• 7:30 PM: Plancenoit falls to Prussians (French rear threatened)
• 8:00 PM: Final French assault on La Haye Sainte
• 8:30 PM: Imperial Guard attacks—and fails
• 9:00 PM: Prussian pressure collapses French right
• Night: French army disintegrates

T.C.W. Blanning describes the coalition coordination:

"What made Waterloo decisive was the arrival of the Prussians. Wellington
had promised to stand at Waterloo only if Blücher could support him, and
Blücher kept his word despite the defeat at Ligny two days earlier. By
late afternoon, 30,000 Prussians were engaging Napoleon's right flank,
forcing him to divert the Young Guard to Plancenoit instead of committing
it against Wellington. By evening, another 20,000 had arrived. The French
found themselves fighting two armies, and the numbers became impossible."
— T.C.W. Blanning, *The Pursuit of Glory* (2007)

This is the Trachenberg strategy perfected: avoid Napoleon alone,
combine against him with overwhelming force. At Leipzig, the coalition
needed four days; at Waterloo, one afternoon sufficed.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. COMMAND PHILOSOPHIES: NAPOLEON VS. WELLINGTON
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Waterloo is a duel between two command philosophies.

John Keegan's *The Mask of Command* contrasts them directly:

**Napoleon: "Heroic" Command**
• Personal visibility at crisis points
• Soldier recognition ("Vive l'Empereur!")
• Centralized decision—everything flows through Napoleon
• Theatrical display; bulletin control
• Charisma as force multiplier

**Wellington: "Anti-Heroic" Command**
• Controlled visibility; present but not theatrical
• Institutional discipline over personal charisma
• Delegation to trusted subordinates
• Cold professional demeanor
• System survives commander's absence

Keegan explains the contrast:

"Napoleon commanded through personal magnetism. His presence on the
battlefield was itself a weapon—troops fought harder when they knew
he watched. Wellington commanded through professional competence.
His officers knew their business; they did not need inspiration,
they needed orders. Napoleon's system required Napoleon; Wellington's
system required only that someone competent occupy the headquarters.
This difference would prove decisive at Waterloo."
— John Keegan, *The Mask of Command* (1987)

At Waterloo, the contrast is fatal:

"Wellington positioned himself at crisis points throughout the day,
riding to wherever the line was hardest pressed, but always with
the same cold demeanor. He did not inspire; he steadied. Napoleon,
by contrast, remained behind the lines for much of the battle,
possibly due to illness, certainly distant from the tactical detail.
The heroic commander who had charged at Arcole and stood at Austerlitz
was absent. His subordinates—Ney, d'Erlon—made decisions he would
not have made. The system that required Napoleon was operating
without him."
— John Keegan, *The Mask of Command* (1987)

Wellington's "anti-heroic" style produced resilience; Napoleon's
"heroic" style produced vulnerability when the hero was absent.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. THE GUARD'S FAILURE: SYMBOLIC COLLAPSE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Imperial Guard's repulse ends Napoleonic authority.

The Guard had never failed in attack. Its commitment signaled
Napoleon's final throw; its retreat signaled the end.

John Keegan captures the symbolic weight:

"When the Imperial Guard retreated—not routed, but retreated—the cry
went up across the French line: 'La Garde recule!' The Guard falls back.
It was unthinkable. The Guard had never failed. It was the embodiment
of Napoleonic invincibility, the living proof that French arms could
not be defeated. When the Guard retreated, the army knew the battle
was lost. The retreat became a rout not because of further combat but
because belief had collapsed. The Guard's failure was the end of a myth."
— John Keegan, *The Face of Battle* (1976)

Declarative authority (AXIOM FRANCIA-001) terminates when its symbolic
foundation shatters. The Guard *was* Napoleonic legitimacy made visible.
Its failure terminates the declaration's power.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Waterloo becomes Francia's **terminal reference point**.

For Francia, it encodes:
• Charisma without institutional depth collapses instantly
• Military genius cannot outpace systemic exhaustion
• Universal ambition invites overwhelming coalition response
• Revolutionary authority ends, but revolutionary memory persists

The critical distinction from Leipzig:

| Leipzig (1813) | Waterloo (1815) |
|----------------|-----------------|
| Satellite defection cascade | No satellites (French-only army) |
| Extraction system collapse | Reconstituted national force |
| System failure | Defeat in battle |
| Napoleon abdicated, returned | Napoleon abdicated, exiled permanently |

Leipzig ended the extraction system. Waterloo ended Napoleon.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VIII. POST-WATERLOO: RESTORATION WITHOUT LEGITIMACY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Bourbon Restoration lacks internal authority.

Henry Kissinger analyzes the settlement:

"The Second Restoration of 1815 was more fragile than the first.
Louis XVIII returned 'in the baggage train of the allies,' and no
amount of constitutional gestures could erase that origin. The Charter
might grant representative institutions, but the regime lacked the
legitimacy that comes from organic development. France after Waterloo
was governed by a dynasty that had been restored by foreign armies
twice in two years. The revolutionary memory was suppressed, not resolved."
— Henry Kissinger, *A World Restored* (1957)

DOCTRINE v0.4 (Post-Hegemonic Strategic Anxiety) originates here:
Francia internalizes defeat as civilizational memory, producing
defensive strategy and long-term anxiety masked by universalist rhetoric.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IX. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Charismatic authority collapses faster than dynastic authority.
• Coalition coordination (Wellington + Blücher) defeats divided response.
• Cavalry without infantry support cannot break disciplined squares.
• The Imperial Guard's symbolic failure terminates belief.
• Declarative authority ends when its visible embodiment fails.
• Waterloo is Francia's defeat, not satellite system collapse.
• Revolutionary authority ends, but revolutionary memory persists.
• Restoration lacks legitimacy; anxiety is imprinted.
• The Hundred Days proves rupture-renewal has limits.
• Military genius cannot compensate for systemic exhaustion indefinitely.

Contradictions preserved without verdict.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This MEM supports:

AXIOM FRANCIA-001 (Authority from declaration):
• Guard's failure terminates declarative authority
• Symbolic foundation shatters → authority ends

AXIOM FRANCIA-003 (Rupture enables renewal):
• Hundred Days = attempted rupture-renewal
• Waterloo = renewal fails; cycle terminates

AXIOM FRANCIA-005 (Declarative authority binds only destinationless):
• By 1815, no destinations remain for Napoleon
• Coalition unified; no defection possible
• Declaration cannot bind anyone

DOCTRINE v0.4 (Post-Hegemonic Strategic Anxiety):
• Waterloo imprints defeat as civilizational memory
• Restoration anxiety originates here
