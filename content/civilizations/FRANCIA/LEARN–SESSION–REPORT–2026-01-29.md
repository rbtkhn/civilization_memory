# SCHOLAR FRANCIA LEARN SESSION REPORT — 29 January 2026

**Mode:** SCHOLAR FRANCIA LEARN  
**Scope:** Firnhaber-Baker corpus synthesis; medieval Francia (Capet → Valois); Joan of Arc, post-Reims, Aquitaine 1453; tri-frame (Barnes, Mearsheimer, Mercouris)

---

## 1. SYNTHESIS & INGESTION

**Firnhaber-Baker corpus (ENTRY 0012 → SYNTHESIS 0007)**  
- Three works synthesized: *House of Lilies*, *The Jacquerie of 1358*, *Violence and the State in Languedoc, 1250–1400*.  
- **Primary belief:** Medieval Francia rests on (1) **consolidation by patience** (Capetians outlast rivals, absorb by inheritance/marriage); (2) **rupture from below as planned, not fury** (Jacquerie targeted, nobility targeted when prestige fails); (3) **royal expansion by cooperation** (Languedoc: elite complicity and negotiation as much as force).  
- SYNTHESIS 0007 frozen; Assumptions Box added.

**Trace: consolidation by patience (Capet → Valois)**  
- Capet: patience = outlasting rivals, marriage (Aquitaine gained then lost by annulment).  
- Valois: patience = **continuity under sustained breakdown** (same legitimacy grammar—sacral kingship, Salic Law, fleur-de-lys—through catastrophe); reabsorption of Aquitaine by war (1369–1453), not marriage.

**Mapping onto AXIOM FRANCIA-003 and SYNTHESIS 0004**  
- "Continuity under sustained breakdown" (Firnhaber-Baker) = axiom-003 **limit** (renewal requires grammar survival) + synthesis-0004 **mechanism** (renewal through myth, law, symbol; symbolic > procedural continuity).  
- **Test cases added:** AXIOM FRANCIA-003 Refinement (Valois 1328–1453); SYNTHESIS 0004 Assumption 2 BASIS (Valois, *House of Lilies*).  
- Mapping recorded in Session Activity.

**RLL–FRANCIA–0011 (CANDIDATE) proposed**  
- "Continuity under sustained breakdown" = axiom-003 limit + synthesis-0004 mechanism in medieval form.  
- Test cases: Valois 1328–1453; Joan of Arc (myth carrier); Notre-Dame / fleur-de-lys (symbol carriers).  
- Tri-frame note added (Barnes, Mearsheimer, Mercouris on Joan and post-Reims).

## 2. MYTH/SYMBOL CARRIERS & ENTRIES

**ENTRY 0013** — MEM–WAR–HUNDRED–YEARS, MEM–NOTRE–DAME  
- **Joan of Arc** = myth carrier (sacral intervention, Reims 1429, moral reversal before material recovery; belief compensates for institutional absence).  
- **Fleur-de-lys, Notre-Dame** = symbol carriers (Valois grammar; legitimacy vessel in stone).  
- Supports RLL–0011; tri-frame note added (see RLL–0011).

**ENTRY 0014** — MEM–FRANCIA–AQUITAINE  
- **1453** (Castillon, Bordeaux) = endpoint of post-Reims material recovery.  
- Aquitaine reabsorbed by war and administration; Valois restore Channel-to-Pyrenees territorial integrity.  
- Completes sequence: legitimacy shift (Reims 1429) → material conversion (1431–1453) → territorial reabsorption (1453).  
- Supports SYNTHESIS 0004 medieval extension and RLL–0011.

---

## 3. SYNTHESIS 0004 MEDIEVAL EXTENSION

**Post-Reims (1431–1453) mapped onto SYNTHESIS 0004**  
- Medieval extension block added under SYNTHESIS 0004:  
  - Hundred Years' War as **rupture**; recovery through **symbolic reassertion** (Reims, Joan, fleur-de-lys) **before** procedural continuity (standing army, taille, territorial recovery 1431–1453).  
  - Legitimacy grammar held through breakdown; material recovery follows once grammar again generates extraction and alignment.  
- References: ENTRY 0013, RLL–0011.

---

## 4. TRI-FRAME SESSION (JOAN & POST-REIMS)

**Barnes (Joan 1429)**  
- Jurisdiction: sacral vs Troyes grammar; Joan asserts higher jurisdiction (divine mandate).  
- Liability: Joan and Dauphin carry exposure; Joan steps into liability gap.  
- Defection: redefection to Valois made thinkable by Reims; Joan reverses defection calculus.  
- Irreversibility: Reims = un-coronation-proof; legitimacy move done.

**Mearsheimer (Joan & post-Reims)**  
- Moral reversal = legitimacy shift that changes **expected** force ratios and defection calculus; coalition stability on Anglo-Burgundian side depends on Valois looking like loser—Joan/Reims undermine that.  
- Post-Reims 1431–1453 = **material conversion**: Arras (1435) coalition shift, standing army, taille, territorial recovery; legitimacy shift monetized.

**Mercouris (response to Barnes and Mearsheimer)**  
- Legitimacy grammar makes defection legible as **restoration** (not only realignment).  
- Continuity under breakdown = same grammar held; post-Reims = when power catches up to grammar.  
- Narrative irreversibility: war remembered as legitimacy resurrection, not only force-ratio shift.

Tri-frame summary added to **RLL–FRANCIA–0011** and **ENTRY 0013**.
