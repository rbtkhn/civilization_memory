I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves Notre-Dame de Reims (Reims Cathedral) as **Francia's
coronation church**: the building where French kings were anointed and
crowned, where Gothic architecture and sacral kingship were fused, and
where Charles VII's coronation (1429) re-anchored Valois legitimacy
during the Hundred Years' War.

For Francia, the cathedral encodes **legitimacy in stone**—the structure
that performs the ritual without which kingship is incomplete, and that
(outside Paris) concentrates crown, church, and God at the critical
moment of royal consecration.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. ORIGIN: GOTHIC AND CORONATION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The present cathedral (Notre-Dame de Reims) is built from the early
13th century on the site of earlier churches; Clovis's baptism is
traditionally located here.

Conditions:
• Archbishopric of Reims as consecrator of French kings
• Gothic rebuilding (1211 onward) aligns with Capetian consolidation
• Cathedral becomes the fixed stage for coronation ritual—anointing,
  crowning, oath—binding king, realm, and divine favor

Verbatim scholarship (ARC-T-MODERN):

"Notre-Dame emerges from high Capetian consolidation—Paris rising as
the symbolic and administrative core of a realm that had learned to
outlast rivals. **Gothic architecture became sacral technology**: the
cathedral concentrated legitimacy, binding crown, city, and God in
stone. The building was not merely religious; it was the monarchy's
memory made visible."
— Justine Firnhaber-Baker, *House of Lilies: The Dynasty That Made
Medieval France* (London: Allen Lane, 2024) (ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-SECONDARY]

Reims Cathedral applies that logic to **coronation**: it is the monarchy's
memory made visible at the moment of royal inception. Paris's Notre-Dame
anchors the capital; Reims's Notre-Dame anchors the **ritual** that
makes the king.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. 1429: CHARLES VII AND JOAN OF ARC
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The coronation of Charles VII (July 1429) in the cathedral is the
turning point of Valois legitimacy during the Hundred Years' War.

Dynamics:
• Joan of Arc insists on Reims; the Dauphin's forces secure the route
• Coronation in the cathedral (17 July 1429) re-moralizes the war
• Legitimacy is ritually restored before material recovery (1431–1453)

The building is thus the **stage** for the sequence identified in
MEM–FRANCIA–WAR–HUNDRED–YEARS and CIV–SCHOLAR–FRANCIA: moral reversal
(preceding material recovery). The cathedral does not win battles; it
performs the act that makes Valois victory legible as restoration.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. SURVIVAL AND REINTERPRETATION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The cathedral suffers damage (e.g. World War I shelling) and is
restored; it retains symbolic centrality as coronation church and
national heritage.

Shifts:
• Post-revolution: coronation ritual lapses; building remains symbol
• 20th c.: restoration after war damage; UNESCO World Heritage
• Meaning: from active coronation site to **coronation memory**—the
  place where French kings were made, and where that grammar was
  last performed for Charles VII in 1429 (later coronations elsewhere
  or abandoned)

The structure outlasts the ritual's regular use; it remains the
**reference point** for sacral kingship in civilizational memory.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. CIVILIZATIONAL SIGNIFICANCE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
For Francia, Reims Cathedral encodes:

• **Coronation as sacral technology**—Gothic stone as the stage for
  anointing and crowning; legitimacy concentrated in one building
• **Ritual geography**—Reims (city) is the coronation city because
  the cathedral is here; building and city are inseparable for
  legitimacy grammar
• **Contrast with Notre-Dame de Paris**—Paris's cathedral anchors
  the capital and daily legitimacy; Reims's cathedral anchors the
  **moment** of royal inception. Both bind crown, city, and God;
  Reims does so at the threshold of kingship

SYNTHESIS 0004 and RLL–FRANCIA–0011: The cathedral is the **site**
where symbolic reassertion (Reims 1429) is performed—the building
that carries the myth of sacral restoration in the Hundred Years' War.
