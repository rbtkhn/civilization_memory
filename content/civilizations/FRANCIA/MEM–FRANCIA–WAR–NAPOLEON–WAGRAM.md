I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves Wagram as **Francia's demonstration that victory
can be achieved through attrition when operational brilliance fails**:
the battle that showed the Napoleonic system could still win, but at
costs that signaled systemic strain.

For Francia, Wagram represents **declarative authority sustained through
material expenditure**—victory purchased rather than manufactured.

Unlike Austerlitz (brilliance defeating mass) or Jena (operational
annihilation), Wagram is won through numerical superiority and
persistence. The system works, but the mechanism has changed.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. STRATEGIC CONTEXT: AUSTRIA'S RENEWED CHALLENGE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
In 1809, Austria rises again—reformed and emboldened.

Conditions:
• Napoleon engaged in Spain (Peninsula War draining resources)
• Austrian army reformed under Archduke Charles
• Popular war sentiment in Austria ("national awakening")
• Prussia and Russia formally neutral, Austria acts alone
• Bonaparte forced to return from Spain

David G. Chandler explains the strategic moment:

"Austria's decision to renew the war in 1809 was based on a calculation
that Napoleon was overextended. The Spanish ulcer was draining French
resources; the marshals were failing to suppress the insurrection.
Archduke Charles had spent four years reforming the Austrian army,
introducing corps organization and improving training. Austria believed
it faced Napoleon at his most vulnerable since 1800. The calculation
was wrong, but not entirely—Wagram would be the costliest victory
Napoleon had yet achieved."
— David G. Chandler, *The Campaigns of Napoleon* (1966)

Austria's reform mirrors what Prussia had done after Jena. The pattern
of defeat-reform-return is becoming visible.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. ASPERN-ESSLING: THE UNPRECEDENTED REVERSE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Before Wagram, Napoleon suffers his first major battlefield defeat.

Aspern-Essling (21-22 May 1809):
• French crossing of the Danube fails
• Austrian counterattack forces retreat
• Marshal Lannes killed
• ~20,000 French casualties
• First clear defeat of Napoleon in open battle

The psychological impact exceeds the military.

Andrew Roberts describes the significance:

"Aspern-Essling shattered the myth of Napoleon's invincibility. For the
first time in a decade, a major European army had defeated Napoleon in
open battle. Archduke Charles became a hero across Europe; congratulations
flowed from Prussia and Russia. More importantly, it demonstrated that
Napoleon could be beaten by an army that had studied his methods and
refused to be intimidated. The defeat was tactical, not strategic—Napoleon
still held Vienna—but its psychological effect was immense."
— Andrew Roberts, *Napoleon: A Life* (2014)

Wagram must now compensate for Aspern-Essling. Victory is no longer
expected; it must be proven.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. THE BATTLE: MASS AND PERSISTENCE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Wagram is won differently from Austerlitz or Jena.

Day 1 (5 July):
• French cross Danube in strength (lessons from Aspern)
• Austrian line holds
• French night attack fails with heavy casualties
• No breakthrough achieved

Day 2 (6 July):
• Austrian attack on French left achieves early success
• Napoleon commits massive artillery concentration (100+ guns)
• MacDonald's column attack breaks Austrian center
• Austrian army retreats in good order

T.C.W. Blanning describes the attritional character:

"Wagram was not a battle of maneuver but of attrition. Napoleon achieved
victory through the simple expedient of having more men and guns than his
opponent. The massive artillery bombardment that preceded MacDonald's
attack—over one hundred guns concentrated on a narrow front—represented
a new approach: substituting firepower for operational finesse. The
Austrian army was not destroyed at Wagram; it was pushed back. Charles
retreated in good order, and the armistice that followed was negotiated,
not imposed."
— T.C.W. Blanning, *The Pursuit of Glory* (2007)

The operational brilliance of Austerlitz has become the material
superiority of Wagram. The system still works, but differently.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. CASUALTY ANALYSIS: THE PRICE OF VICTORY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Wagram's casualties reveal systemic strain.

Comparative casualties:
• Austerlitz (1805): ~9,000 French casualties
• Jena (1806): ~12,000 French casualties (both battles)
• Wagram (1809): ~39,000 French casualties

The ratio changes:
• Austerlitz: French casualties ~1:3 vs coalition
• Wagram: French casualties roughly equal to Austrian

Jean Tulard identifies the warning:

"Wagram should have been a signal. The victory was real, but its cost
was unprecedented. Nearly forty thousand French casualties—more than
the entire army that fought at Marengo—suggested that the opponents
were improving faster than the empire. The Austrian army of 1809 was
not the army of 1805; it had learned from defeat. If Austria could
improve this rapidly, what of Prussia, what of Russia? The coalition
was becoming educated in Napoleonic methods."
— Jean Tulard, *Napoleon: The Myth of the Saviour* (1984)

Victory through attrition requires replacement capacity.
Replacement capacity requires continued extraction.
Extraction has costs that accumulate.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. THE HABSBUR MARRIAGE: LEGITIMACY PIVOT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Wagram's aftermath produces an extraordinary pivot.

Napoleon, the revolutionary general, marries a Habsburg princess.

Sequence:
• October 1809: Treaty of Schönbrunn signed
• December 1809: Napoleon divorces Josephine
• April 1810: Napoleon marries Marie Louise of Austria
• March 1811: Napoleon II born (King of Rome)

Henry Kissinger analyzes the legitimacy calculation:

"The marriage to Marie Louise represented Napoleon's attempt to
transcend revolutionary legitimacy through dynastic absorption. If he
could not claim the authority of ancient lineage, he would acquire it
by marriage. The great-niece of Marie Antoinette became Empress of
the French; the grandson of the Habsburgs would inherit the Napoleonic
empire. It was a brilliant solution to the problem of revolutionary
succession—and it fundamentally misunderstood the nature of Napoleonic
authority. Napoleon's legitimacy came from victory, not from bloodlines.
Purchasing Habsburg prestige could not substitute for military success."
— Henry Kissinger, *Diplomacy* (1994)

The pivot reveals anxiety about AXIOM FRANCIA-001's foundation.
If authority flows from declaration, what happens when declarations
become more expensive to enforce?

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. SYSTEMIC STRAIN: THE EXTRACTION QUESTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Wagram exposes the extraction system's sustainability problem.

The mathematics:
• Wagram costs ~39,000 casualties
• Peninsula War costs ~100,000+ annually
• Continental System enforcement diverts resources
• Satellite states provide troops, but at what quality?

By 1809, the extraction ledger is growing:
• German contingents in Spain: resented service
• Italian conscription: resistance increasing
• Dutch annexation (1810): eliminates buffer, adds obligation

SYNTHESIS 0005's preconditions are not yet met (no destination visible),
but the **extraction costs** are accumulating.

François Furet identifies the structural problem:

"After Wagram, the Napoleonic system entered a new phase. Victory still
came, but at increasing cost. The Grande Armée that would invade Russia
in 1812 would be larger than any previous force—but its quality would
be diluted by foreign contingents of uncertain loyalty. The empire had
become a machine requiring constant fuel: conscripts, taxes, and the
subordination of satellite economies. As long as victories came, the
fuel flowed. But each victory was more expensive than the last, and
each defeat—when it came—would be more dangerous."
— François Furet, *Revolutionary France 1770-1880* (1992)

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VIII. ARCHDUKE CHARLES: THE ENEMY WHO LEARNED
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Wagram demonstrates that opponents are adapting.

Archduke Charles represents the new reality:
• Studied Napoleonic methods systematically
• Reformed Austrian army on corps principles
• Accepted battle on favorable terms only (Aspern)
• Retreated in good order when beaten (Wagram)
• Preserved army as a force-in-being

Peter H. Wilson contextualizes the adaptation:

"Archduke Charles was the first opponent to successfully apply
Napoleonic principles against Napoleon. The corps organization he
introduced to the Austrian army, the improved training, the tactical
flexibility—all were learned from French example. At Aspern-Essling,
he demonstrated that these methods worked. At Wagram, he showed that
even in defeat, an army that had absorbed the lessons could survive
to fight again. The Austrian army of 1809 was not destroyed; it was
defeated. The difference would matter in 1813."
— Peter H. Wilson, *The Thirty Years War* (2009), contextual analysis

The coalition is learning. Each war teaches them more.
Eventually, they will have learned enough.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IX. CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Wagram becomes **the expensive victory**.

For Francia, it encodes:
• Victory is still possible against reformed opponents
• Material superiority can substitute for operational brilliance
• Even victories have mounting costs
• The empire requires constant expansion to sustain

But the warning signs are processed as success:
• "Napoleon won" (ignoring cost)
• "Austria submitted" (ignoring Austrian survival as force)
• "Habsburg marriage secures legitimacy" (ignoring dependence on victory)

DOCTRINE v0.5 (Legitimacy-Capacity Oscillator) is in motion:
• Claim: universal empire
• Capacity: strained by casualties and extraction
• Resolution mechanism: more war (Russia 1812)

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
X. WAGRAM IN THE NAPOLEONIC ARC
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Position in the sequence:

| Battle | Year | Character | Cost | Lesson |
|--------|------|-----------|------|--------|
| Marengo | 1800 | Near-defeat reversed | Moderate | Founding victory |
| Austerlitz | 1805 | Operational masterpiece | Low | Brilliance wins |
| Jena | 1806 | Total annihilation | Moderate | System superiority |
| **Wagram** | **1809** | **Attritional victory** | **High** | **Mass required** |
| Borodino | 1812 | Pyrrhic victory | Extreme | Victory without decision |
| Leipzig | 1813 | Decisive defeat | Catastrophic | System collapsed |

Wagram is the inflection point: still victory, but by different means.
After Wagram, each major battle becomes more costly until the system
cannot sustain the costs.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
XI. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Victory through attrition replaces victory through brilliance.
• Opponents who survive defeat return reformed and more capable.
• Casualty ratios worsen as coalition armies adapt.
• Habsburg marriage attempts legitimacy pivot from victory to dynasty.
• Extraction costs accumulate between major campaigns.
• Archduke Charles demonstrates coalition learning.
• The system still works at Wagram, but the mechanism has changed.
• Aspern-Essling proves Napoleon can be defeated in open battle.
• Wagram costs signal future sustainability problems.
• Each victory makes the next more expensive.

Contradictions preserved without verdict.
