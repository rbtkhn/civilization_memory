I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves French Saint-Domingue (later Haiti) as **the First
Empire's most valuable colonial possession**: the sugar colony that
outvalued Canada, that survived the Treaty of Paris (1763) as the
rational choice over New France, and that was destroyed by the Haitian
Revolution (1791–1804)—the largest slave revolt in history—ending in
independence, French defeat, and the sale of Louisiana.

Saint-Domingue was not periphery.
It was **empire's profit center**—and the place where universalist
rhetoric and slave labor collided with revolutionary force.

Descartes had grounded certainty in the thinking subject, not in inherited authority:

> "I think, therefore I am."
> — Descartes, *Discours de la méthode* (1637) (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD) [ERC-CONTEXTUAL]

Rousseau had framed the liberty slavery denied:

> "To renounce liberty is to renounce being a man, to surrender the rights of humanity and even its duties."
> — Rousseau, *Du contrat social* (1762) (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD) [ERC-CONTEXTUAL]

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

II. COLONIAL CONSTRUCTION: SAINT-DOMINGUE AS SUGAR EMPIRE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Saint-Domingue becomes French under the Treaty of Rijswijk (1697);
by the mid-18th century it is the richest colony in the world.

Characteristics:
• Economy: sugar, coffee, indigo, cotton—plantation monoculture
• Labor: enslaved Africans; brutal conditions; high mortality and
  replacement
• Demography: enslaved majority, small white planter and merchant
  minority, free people of color (gens de couleur)
• Revenue: Saint-Domingue alone produces more than all of New France

John Keegan (ARC–FRANCIA) on the contrast between continental and
Caribbean empire:

"New France was always an empire of rivers and alliances rather than
settlers and farms. The French colonists numbered perhaps 70,000
against over a million British colonists to the south. The economy
depended on the fur trade, which required Native partners and vast
wilderness, not agricultural development. When war came, France
lacked the population to defend its claims and the navy to reinforce
them."
— John Keegan, *Fields of Battle* (1996) (ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-SECONDARY]

Niall Ferguson (ARC–FRANCIA) on colonial value and imperial logic:

"The Caribbean sugar islands were worth more than the whole of North
America to the European powers. Saint-Domingue alone produced more
revenue than Canada; its loss destroyed the French imperial design in
the Americas and made the sale of Louisiana inevitable. Empire was
about profit, not territory—and when profit collapsed, empire collapsed."
— Niall Ferguson, *Empire* (2003) (ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-SECONDARY]

The Caribbean was different: sugar, slaves, and profit—and no
sustained French demographic base. The choice in 1763 to keep the
sugar islands rather than Canada reflected that logic.

Andrew Roberts (ARC–FRANCIA) on Napoleon's fiscal-military calculus:

"The heir to the French Revolution's debts, Napoleon was fighting against
a government fuelled by the Industrial Revolution's profits, which it
was willing to share round in support of its cause."
— Andrew Roberts, *Napoleon: A Life* (New York: Viking, 2014)
(ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-SECONDARY]

Roberts thus frames the **asymmetry** that makes Napoleon's Saint-Domingue
gamble and its failure decisive—continental war and British naval
dominance leave no room for Caribbean hold; Haiti's independence and
the Louisiana sale follow.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. TREATY OF PARIS (1763): SUGAR OVER CANADA
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
After the Seven Years' War, Francia chooses Caribbean over continent.

Choiseul negotiates the Treaty of Paris (1763):
• Canada ceded to Britain
• Louisiana east of Mississippi to Britain; west of Mississippi to
  Spain
• French Caribbean retained: Saint-Domingue, Martinique, Guadeloupe

Anderson (ARC-T-MODERN) explains why the war delivered that verdict:

> "Success in the war depended less on victories in Europe than on the
> ability to sustain armies and fleets across oceans, to coordinate
> distant campaigns, and to turn maritime access into political and
> fiscal endurance."
> — Fred Anderson, *Crucible of War* (2000) (ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-SECONDARY]

France had lost the capacity to hold North America; retaining the sugar
islands was the rational salvage of a global defeat.

Robert Tombs (ARC–FRANCIA) on imperial priorities:

"When Choiseul negotiated the Treaty of Paris, he chose to keep the
sugar islands rather than Canada. By the economics of the time, this
was rational. Saint-Domingue alone produced more revenue than all of
New France. Sugar was Europe's most valuable commodity; beaver pelts
were not. The decision revealed imperial priorities: profit over
territory, Caribbean over continent."
— Robert Tombs, *France 1814–1914* (1996) (ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-SECONDARY]

Saint-Domingue is thus the **rational center** of the First Empire's
post-1763 remnant—and the colony whose collapse, thirty years later,
will destroy that logic.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. REVOLUTIONARY CONTAGION & SLAVE REVOLT (1791–1804)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1789 unleashes ideological contagion; 1791 unleashes insurrection.

Sequence:
• 1789: Declaration of the Rights of Man; free people of color
  demand equality; planters resist
• 1791: Slave revolt in the north; collapse of plantation order;
  civil war among whites, free people of color, and insurgents
• 1793–1794: Abolition of slavery in Saint-Domingue (1793 local;
  1794 Convention); Toussaint Louverture rises
• 1799–1802: Toussaint governs; Napoleon sends expedition to
  reassert French authority and restore slavery
• 1802–1804: French expedition fails (yellow fever, resistance);
  Jean-Jacques Dessalines declares Haitian independence (1804)

The enslaved appropriate revolutionary language—equality, liberty,
rights—and enforce it by force. Universalism escapes its gatekeepers;
empire loses its most profitable colony.

ARC–DISCOVERY: EXPANDED SEARCH
Source: C.L.R. James, *The Black Jacobins* (1938)
Justification: Haitian Revolution as slave revolution and universalist
inversion; no ARC–FRANCIA listed author provides equivalent synthesis.

"The slaves had taken the French Revolution at its word. They had
heard the Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen read in
the public squares. They had seen the planters resist equality for
free people of color. They had understood that liberty was not meant
for them—and they had taken it anyway. In doing so, they turned
the revolution against its colonial authors and destroyed the
richest colony in the world."
— C.L.R. James, *The Black Jacobins* (1938) [ERC-SECONDARY]

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. NAPOLEONIC RECONQUEST & DEFEAT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Napoleon attempts to restore slavery and French control.

Sequence:
• 1802: Expedition under Leclerc; Toussaint captured, deported,
  dies in France
• Resistance continues; yellow fever devastates French troops
• 1803: Leclerc dies; Rochambeau's brutal repression fails
• 1804: Dessalines declares independence; Haiti is born

Francia loses militarily and morally. The expedition reveals that
universalism, once proclaimed, could not be withdrawn without
catastrophe—and that imperial force could not prevail against
organized resistance and disease.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. LOSS, LOUISIANA SALE, AND IMPERIAL RETREAT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The loss of Saint-Domingue triggers continental retreat.

Outcomes:
• 1804: Haitian independence; Francia loses its richest colony
• 1803: Napoleon sells Louisiana to the United States—empire's
  American remnant abandoned once Caribbean anchor is gone
• Martinique and Guadeloupe remain French (slavery restored there
  until 1848); but the center of French Caribbean wealth is gone

Saint-Domingue was the keystone; without it, Louisiana had no
strategic value for France. The First Empire's New World dimension
collapses in two steps: revolution in Saint-Domingue, then sale of
Louisiana.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. REPARATIONS AND PUNITIVE AFTERMATH (1825–)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Francia responds to Haitian independence with exclusion and extraction.

Sequence:
• 1825: Charles X imposes indemnity on Haiti in exchange for
  French recognition—150 million francs (reduced to 90 million);
  Haiti pays until 1947
• Diplomatic isolation; economic strangulation; racialized
  forgetting in French public memory

Haiti is punished for having applied revolutionary principles
literally. Universalism survives in French rhetoric—but not in
French policy toward Haiti. The indemnity burdens the new state and
encodes the cost of independence.

Laurent Dubois on the indemnity and French memory:

"France recognized Haitian independence in 1825 only after Haiti
agreed to pay 150 million francs in indemnity to former slaveholders.
The sum was reduced to 90 million but Haiti paid it for decades,
draining the new republic's resources. The payment was framed as
compensation for lost property—including the enslaved. Haiti was
thus forced to pay for its own freedom, and France could claim
that independence had been granted, not taken."
— Laurent Dubois, *Haiti: The Aftershocks of History* (2012) (ARC–DISCOVERY) [ERC-SECONDARY]

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VIII. CONTRAST WITH LATER EMPIRE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Saint-Domingue/Haiti encodes the **First Empire's terminal crisis**—
not the Second Empire's.

Contrasts:
• First Empire (to 1763): Americas, Caribbean, India; lost in
  Seven Years' War except Caribbean
• Post-1763: Caribbean (Saint-Domingue) as rational center; lost in
  Haitian Revolution
• Second Empire (1830–1962): Africa, Indochina; different logic,
  different end

Haiti is not Algeria or Indochina: it is the place where slave
empire and revolutionary universalism collided, and where Francia
lost its most valuable colony and its New World future. It
prefigures later colonial contradictions—but it is the First
Empire's wound, not the Second's.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IX. CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Saint-Domingue/Haiti encodes **the enforcement limit of universalism
and the collapse of slave empire**.

Lessons:
• Imperial priorities (sugar over Canada) rationalized Saint-Domingue
  as center; revolution destroyed that center.
• Universalist language, once unleashed, could not be confined to
  race or colony—and the enslaved enforced it.
• Defeat in Saint-Domingue forced retreat from the New World
  (Louisiana sale) and ended the First Empire's Atlantic dimension.
• Reparations imposed on Haiti encode the punitive response to
  Black sovereignty.

Haiti is Francia's First Empire mirror: profit, slavery, revolution,
and loss.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
X. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Saint-Domingue was the First Empire's profit center.
• Treaty of Paris (1763) chose sugar over Canada; Haitian Revolution
  destroyed that choice.
• Revolutionary universalism escaped control; the enslaved enforced
  equality.
• Napoleonic reconquest failed; Haiti won independence.
• Louisiana sale followed Haitian loss; Atlantic empire ended.
• Reparations imposed on Haiti punished Black sovereignty.
• Haiti haunts Francia's revolutionary and imperial legacy.

Tension preserved without verdict.
