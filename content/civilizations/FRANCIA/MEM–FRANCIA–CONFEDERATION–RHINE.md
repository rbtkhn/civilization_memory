I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves the Confederation of the Rhine as **the moment
when Francia projected power across the eastern horizon**: a
client structure that extended French hegemony east of the Rhine
and that collapsed when coalition and retreat made the river again
the limit of French reach.

For Francia, the Confederation is not merely a diplomatic arrangement.
It is **hegemony made institutional**—and then **reversed**. The river
encodes who can project across it; between 1806 and 1814, Francia
could; after 1814, it could not. That reversal becomes the structural
prelude to 1871, when the Rhine becomes wound rather than frontier.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

II. ORIGIN: NAPOLEONIC REORGANIZATION OF GERMAN SPACE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Confederation of the Rhine was founded in July 1806, after
Austerlitz and the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire. Napoleon
reorganized the German territorial map into a bloc of client states
bound to France by treaty, military obligation, and economic
alignment.

Sixteen German states initially joined; others were added. The
Confederation provided troops for Napoleon’s campaigns, closed
territory to British trade, and extended French administrative and
strategic influence to the right bank of the Rhine. In effect, the
Rhine ceased to be Francia’s eastern limit—it became the **spine of
a French-dominated system**.

David Chandler frames the structural logic:

"Napoleon's Confederation of the Rhine was designed to give France
secure strategic depth east of the river and to turn German manpower
and resources into instruments of French policy. It was hegemony by
proxy—and it lasted only as long as French military power could
enforce it."
— David Chandler, *The Campaigns of Napoleon* (ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-SECONDARY]

The Confederation is thus **contingent on force**: legitimacy flows
from French victory, not from inherited or consensual German
allegiance.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. STRUCTURE AND LEGITIMACY CLAIM
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Institutional continuity under the Confederation was thin. Member
states retained internal administration but ceded foreign policy and
military direction to French demands. Succession to the Confederation
was dictated by Napoleon; territory was reshaped to reward allies and
punish holdouts.

It seems fair to say that the Confederation lacked a stable
legitimacy grammar of its own. It rested on Napoleonic victory and
the calculation of German elites that alignment with France was
safer than resistance. When that calculation flipped—when the
balance of power shifted after the Russian campaign and the Sixth
Coalition—the structure had no independent reason to endure.

Andrew Roberts stresses the personal and contingent character of
the bond:

"The Rheinbund princes had tied their fortunes to Napoleon's star.
When he fell, they had no alternative framework. The Confederation
was Napoleon's creation; it died with his retreat."
— Andrew Roberts, *Napoleon: A Life* (2014) (ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-SECONDARY]

The river that had been **crossed** by French power was again the
line beyond which French authority did not run.

IV. WHO PROJECTS ACROSS THE RHINE: STRUCTURAL READING
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The structural observation is direct: the Rhine rewards the power
that can project across it. Between 1806 and 1814, that power was
France. The Confederation was the institutional form of that
projection—client states, troop contingents, economic closure. When
Napoleon’s army was broken in Russia and then driven back in
1813–1814, the Confederation dissolved. Defection cascaded; princes
switched sides; French troops retreated behind the Rhine, then
behind the borders of 1792.

So the Rhine in this period records **reversible hegemony**. Francia
extended across it; when coalition and defeat removed the enforcing
power, the extension collapsed. The river is the line where the
balance of power becomes visible: who holds the left bank, who holds
the right, who can cross. After 1814, Francia held the left bank
only until 1871; then it lost Alsace–Lorraine and the Rhine became
the boundary of **German** power. The Confederation is the earlier
chapter—the brief span when the direction of projection was
French.

Niall Ferguson (ARC–FRANCIA) on the fiscal and structural basis of
Napoleonic hegemony:

"French dominance in Germany rested on victory, not on credit or
institutional loyalty. When the victories stopped, the German clients
had every incentive to defect. Britain could pay for coalition;
France could only extract. That asymmetry determined the outcome."
— Niall Ferguson, *The Cash Nexus* (2001) (ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-SECONDARY]

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. COLLAPSE AND RETREAT: 1813–1814
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The War of the Sixth Coalition undid the Confederation. After
Leipzig (October 1813), French forces withdrew westward. German
Confederation members abandoned the alliance; the structure
dissolved. By 1814, French troops had retreated behind the Rhine;
Napoleon’s eastern system was gone.

The retreat re-established the Rhine as **frontier**—the line France
could not hold beyond. That frontier would hold until 1871, when
defeat in the Franco–Prussian War turned the river into **wound**:
Alsace–Lorraine lost, the Rhine as the border of the new German
Empire. So the Confederation encodes the first half of a two-act
story: projection (1806–1813) and reversal (1813–1814), with a
later act in 1871 when the frontier itself was lost.

Peter Wilson places the Confederation in the longer arc of German
territorial order:

"The Rheinbund was a Napoleonic imposition, not a German choice.
Its end in 1813–1814 restored the question of German organization—
a question resolved only in 1871 by force, under Prussian leadership,
and at French expense."
— Peter Wilson, *Iron and Blood* (2022) (ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-SECONDARY]

VI. ENCODING IN FRANCIA MEMORY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
In Francia’s civilizational memory, the Confederation tends to appear
as **episode** rather than **model**. It is the time when France
reached across the Rhine, not the template for how to do so again.
The reversal—retreat, dissolution, then 1871—looms larger than the
years of extension. Post-hegemonic anxiety (doctrine 04) is partly
memory of that reversal: the power that had projected becomes the
power that retreats, then the power that loses the left bank.

The Rhine GEO–MEM and the 19th-century audit (AUDIT–MEARSHEIMER–
FRANCIA–GEO–RIVER–CLUSTER–19C–2026–02–11) record the same structural
point: the Confederation marks the limit of French imperial reach
and the speed of its reversal. No contradiction: legitimacy narrative
(episode, loss) and structural narrative (who projects, reversal)
coexist.

VII. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• The Rhine encodes who can project across it; the Confederation was
  the institutional form of French projection (1806–1814).
• Reversal was rapid: defeat and coalition dissolved the Confederation
  and re-established the river as frontier.
• Hegemony resting on force and extraction, not credit or consent,
  collapses when the balancer can pay and the hegemon cannot.
• The Confederation is the structural prelude to 1871: first frontier
  re-established, then frontier lost (Alsace–Lorraine).
• Post-hegemonic anxiety in Francia is partly memory of projection
  followed by retreat and loss.

Tension preserved without verdict.

DEPENDS_ON:
• MEM–FRANCIA–NAPOLEON — Confederation was Napoleon’s political-military project; personality and legitimacy are prerequisite.
• MEM–FRANCIA–WAR–NAPOLEON–LEIPZIG — Collapse of the Confederation follows Sixth Coalition and retreat from Leipzig.
• MEM–FRANCIA–GEO–RHINE–RIVER — Rhine as eastern horizon and power boundary; Confederation is the period when Francia projected across it.

ENABLES:
• MEM–FRANCIA–GEO–RHINE–RIVER — Section V (Napoleonic zenith and collapse) and 1871 wound narrative; Confederation supplies “zenith” and “reversal.”
• MEM–FRANCIA–ALSACE–LORRAINE — 1871 loss is the second act after Confederation collapse; frontier re-established then lost.
• MEM–FRANCIA–WAR–FRANCO–PRUSSIAN — Franco–Prussian War completes the Rhine story: German power to the river, French loss of left bank.

PARALLELS:
• MEM–GERMANIA–BISMARCK — Later German unification and Prussian dominance over German space invert the direction of projection (German power west to the Rhine).

GEOGRAPHIC:
• MEM–FRANCIA–GEO–RHINE–RIVER — Confederation operated east of the Rhine; collapse re-established river as French frontier.

TEMPORAL_BEFORE:
• MEM–FRANCIA–WAR–FRANCO–PRUSSIAN — Confederation precedes 1870–1871; same river, reversed power.
• MEM–FRANCIA–ALSACE–LORRAINE — Confederation era precedes annexation of Alsace–Lorraine.

TEMPORAL_AFTER:
• MEM–FRANCIA–WAR–NAPOLEON–LEIPZIG — Confederation dissolution follows Leipzig and retreat.
• MEM–FRANCIA–WAR–NAPOLEON–WATERLOO — Final defeat follows collapse of eastern system.
