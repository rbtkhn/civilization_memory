LAYER 2: WAR-TYPE STRUCTURED DATA (MANDATORY)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
BELLIGERENTS:
• Side A: Gallic confederation (Vercingetorix, Arverni)
• Side B: Roman Republic (Gaius Julius Caesar)

CLASSIFICATION:
• Type: Siege / decisive campaign battle
• Scope: Continental / Gallic Wars
• Duration: Approximately 6 weeks (September-October 52 BC)

OUTCOME:
• Victor: Rome (complete)
• Loser: Gaul (Vercingetorix surrenders)
• Settlement: Gallic resistance ends; Gaul becomes Roman

FORCE RATIOS:
• Roman: ~60,000 (12 legions + auxiliaries)
• Gallic (Alesia garrison): ~80,000
• Gallic (relief force): ~250,000 (Caesar's claim; likely exaggerated)
• Romans besieged the besieged while themselves besieged

CASUALTIES:
• Roman: Unknown (significant but not devastating)
• Gallic: Massive; relief army destroyed; garrison surrenders
• Vercingetorix: Captured; later executed in Rome

STRATEGIC CONSEQUENCE:
• Gallic independence ends
• Vercingetorix becomes last symbol of Gallic resistance
• Gaul integrated into Roman world
• Proto-France created through conquest
• Caesar's prestige enables civil war and dictatorship

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves Alesia as **Francia's pre-founding tragedy**:
the siege that ended Gallic independence but created the conditions
for Gallo-Roman civilization, which became medieval and modern France.

For Francia, Alesia is **origin through conquest**—the moment when
independent Gaul died but proto-France was born. Vercingetorix's
surrender is both defeat and foundation myth; he dies so that
Gallo-Roman civilization can emerge.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. STRATEGIC CONTEXT: CAESAR'S GALLIC WARS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Alesia culminates eight years of Roman conquest.

The campaign:
• 58 BC: Caesar begins Gallic Wars
• By 52 BC: Most of Gaul nominally subdued
• 52 BC: General Gallic uprising under Vercingetorix
• Scorched-earth strategy initially successful
• Vercingetorix retreats to Alesia after setback at Gergovia

Caesar's account:

"Vercingetorix represented something new: a unified Gallic command.
The tribes had always fought separately; Caesar had defeated them
in detail. In 52 BC, the Arverni chief convinced the Gauls to
coordinate, to use scorched-earth tactics, to avoid pitched battles.
At Gergovia, he defeated a Roman assault—the only time Caesar lost
a significant engagement in Gaul. Alesia was Vercingetorix's gamble
to maintain that unity long enough for relief to arrive."
— John Keegan, *A History of Warfare* (1993)

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. THE SIEGE WORKS: ROMAN ENGINEERING MASTERY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Caesar constructs double fortification of unprecedented scale.

The circumvallation (inner wall, facing Alesia):
• 18 km of fortifications
• Trenches, palisades, towers every 25 meters
• Traps: lily pits, stimuli (buried stakes), cippi (sharpened branches)

The contravallation (outer wall, facing relief force):
• 21 km of fortifications
• Same defensive features facing outward
• Romans defend in both directions simultaneously

The engineering achievement:

"Caesar's siege works at Alesia remain among the most impressive
military engineering projects ever undertaken in the field. In weeks,
his legions constructed nearly 40 kilometers of fortifications,
defended on both sides. They created a killing zone that neither
the garrison nor the relief army could cross. The works survive
archaeologically; they confirm Caesar's account. Roman military
engineering defeated Gallic numbers."
— John Keegan, *A History of Warfare* (1993)

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. VERCINGETORIX: THE GALLIC HERO
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Vercingetorix represents Gaul's last unified resistance.

His achievement:
• United traditionally rival tribes
• Developed coherent strategy against Rome
• Defeated Caesar at Gergovia
• Created first pan-Gallic military command
• Became French national hero (19th century rehabilitation)

The portrait:

"Vercingetorix was young, charismatic, and ruthless. He enforced
unity by executing those who resisted his leadership. His strategy—
avoiding battle while destroying Roman supplies—was sound. His
mistake was allowing himself to be trapped at Alesia, relying on a
relief force that could not break Roman lines. In French national
mythology, he became the first French hero: the defender who lost
nobly against inevitable defeat."
— Julius Caesar, *Commentarii de Bello Gallico* (primary source)

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. THE RELIEF ARMY: NUMBERS FAIL AGAINST DISCIPLINE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Gallic relief force cannot break Roman fortifications.

The situation:
• ~250,000 Gauls approach (Caesar's claim; modern estimates: 80,000-100,000)
• Romans face attack from inside (garrison) and outside (relief)
• Multiple assaults coordinated between garrison and relief
• All fail against Roman fortifications

The decisive engagement:

"The final Gallic assault combined attacks from garrison and relief
force, concentrated on a weak point in Roman lines. Caesar committed
his last reserves—Germanic cavalry—in a counterattack that struck
the relief force in the rear. The Gauls broke. The relief army fled
the field; the garrison, watching from Alesia, understood that no
help would come. The next day, Vercingetorix surrendered."
— John Keegan, *A History of Warfare* (1993)

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. THE SURRENDER: GALLIC INDEPENDENCE DIES
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Vercingetorix rides out alone to surrender.

The scene (Caesar's account):
• Vercingetorix in full armor on his finest horse
• Rides around Caesar's tribunal
• Dismounts, removes armor, sits at Caesar's feet
• Taken prisoner; held six years in Rome
• Executed after Caesar's triumph (46 BC)

The meaning:

"Vercingetorix's surrender was theatrical: the armor, the horse,
the circuit around Caesar's seat. He presented himself as a king
defeated, not a rebel caught. Caesar understood the propaganda value.
He kept Vercingetorix alive for six years to display him in Rome.
The Gallic hero died strangled in the Tullianum prison after Caesar's
triumph. Independent Gaul died with him."
— Adrian Goldsworthy, *Caesar: Life of a Colossus* (2006)

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Alesia encodes **death as foundation**.

For Francia, Alesia represents:
• Gallic independence ends
• Gallo-Roman civilization begins
• Conquest creates proto-France
• Vercingetorix is ancestor through defeat

The 19th-century rehabilitation:
• Napoleon III excavates Alesia
• Statue of Vercingetorix erected (1865)
• "Our ancestors the Gauls" becomes national education
• Defeat reframed as noble resistance

The paradox:

"Modern France claims both Caesar and Vercingetorix. Caesar
conquered Gaul and made it Roman; Vercingetorix resisted and
became symbol of national identity. The contradiction is productive:
France is both Roman civilization and Gallic resistance, both
universal empire and particular nation. Alesia encodes both."
— Chris Wickham, *The Inheritance of Rome* (2009)

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VIII. ROMAN VICTORY: LEGIONARY SYSTEM SUPREME
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Alesia demonstrates Roman military superiority.

Roman advantages:
• Professional soldiers vs. tribal levies
• Engineering capability: siege works in weeks
• Logistics: maintained supply despite siege
• Command unity: Caesar's personal authority
• Discipline: held against attacks from two directions

John Keegan's assessment:

"Alesia was a victory of system over mass. The Romans were
outnumbered, besieged by vastly larger forces, yet won because
their military system—professional soldiers, organized logistics,
disciplined engineering, unified command—multiplied their effective
power. The Gauls had numbers, courage, and desperation. It was
not enough. Rome conquered Gaul because Rome was better organized."
— John Keegan, *A History of Warfare* (1993)

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IX. AFTERMATH: THE CREATION OF GAUL
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Alesia produces Roman Gaul, which becomes France.

The consequences:
• Resistance collapses throughout Gaul
• Caesar returns to Rome, then civil war
• Gaul becomes province; Romanization begins
• Latin replaces Celtic; cities founded; roads built
• By 5th century: Gallo-Roman identity fully formed

The transformation:

"Roman Gaul was Caesar's creation. The conquest killed perhaps a
million Gauls and enslaved another million—Caesar's own boasts.
But it also created the conditions for Gallo-Roman civilization:
Latin language, Roman law, Mediterranean trade, urban culture.
Medieval France inherited a Roman framework overlaid on Gallic
substrate. Alesia was the hinge: before it, Celtic Gaul; after it,
the ancestor of France."
— John Keegan, *A History of Warfare* (1993)

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
X. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Alesia ended Gallic independence permanently.
• Roman engineering (40 km fortifications) defeated Gallic numbers.
• Vercingetorix unified Gaul but was trapped at Alesia.
• Relief force (~250,000 claimed) could not break Roman lines.
• Vercingetorix surrendered theatrically; was executed in Rome.
• Roman system superiority: discipline, logistics, engineering.
• Gaul becomes Roman; Latin replaces Celtic.
• 19th century rehabilitates Vercingetorix as national hero.
• France claims both Caesar and Vercingetorix—conquest and resistance.
• Death as foundation: Gallic independence dies; France is born.

Contradictions preserved without verdict.
