I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves the French Foreign Legion as **Francia's
expeditionary arm and civilizational paradox**: the military
institution that recruits foreigners to fight for France, that
served empire in Algeria, Mexico, Indochina, and Africa, and that
encodes loyalty to the Legion itself—"Legio Patria Nostra"—as a
substitute for national identity.

The Legion is not the nation-in-arms.
It is **France's army of the other**—foreign bodies, French purpose.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. FOUNDING: LOUIS-PHILIPPE AND ALGERIA
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Legion is created by royal ordinance of 10 March 1831, under
Louis-Philippe, to absorb foreign refugees and unemployed soldiers
after the 1830 Revolution and to supply troops for the conquest of
Algeria without drawing down metropolitan units.

Context:
• Post-1830 instability; foreign nationals in France (Polish, Italian,
  Swiss, German, Spanish)
• Algerian conquest (1830); need for expeditionary manpower
• Prohibition on foreign troops in metropolitan line units (sensitivity
  after Revolution and Napoleonic wars)

Douglas Porch (ARC-compatible scholar) frames the founding logic:

"The Legion was created to solve two problems at once: what to do
with the foreign refugees who had flocked to France after the 1830
revolutions, and how to find troops willing to serve in Algeria
without draining the metropolitan army. It was from the start an
instrument of colonial expansion and social control."
— Douglas Porch, *The French Foreign Legion* (1991) (ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-SECONDARY]

The Legion is **colonial by design**—Algeria is its first and
defining theatre.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. IDENTITY: "LEGIO PATRIA NOSTRA"
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Legionnaires adopt the Legion as fatherland. Anonymity (enlisted
name change) and the five-year first contract reinforce rupture
from prior identity; the Legion becomes family, country, and fate.

Motto and creed:
• "Legio Patria Nostra" (The Legion is our fatherland)
• "Honneur et Fidélité" (Honour and Fidelity)—to the Legion
• Marching pace: 88 steps per minute (slower than line army);
  identity through ritual

The Legion does not ask where you come from—it asks only that you
serve. In return, it offers belonging. The civilizational paradox:
**Francia's most "French" loyalty is enacted by foreigners.**

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. CAMERONE (30 APRIL 1863): FOUNDING MYTH
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
At Camerone (Camarón), Mexico, a company of the Legion (Captain
Danjou, ~65 men) holds a hacienda against several thousand Mexican
troops. The last survivors fix bayonets and charge. The wooden hand
of Captain Danjou (lost earlier) becomes a relic; Camerone is
celebrated annually as the Legion's founding myth.

Porch on Camerone's function:

"Camerone gave the Legion its myth: sacrifice to the last, loyalty
to the mission, death before surrender. It did not matter that the
campaign in Mexico was a failure—the Legion had proved its worth
in the only currency that counted: blood. Every 30 April, the Legion
celebrates Camerone; every legionnaire knows the story."
— Douglas Porch, *The French Foreign Legion* (1991) (ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-SECONDARY]

The myth encodes **sacrifice without political stake**—legionnaires
die for the Legion and for France, not for their own nation.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. EMPIRE: ALGERIA, INDOCHINA, AFRICA
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Legion serves in every major French colonial campaign: Algeria
(1831–1962), Mexico (1863–1867), Tonkin and Indochina (1883–1954),
Morocco, Syria, Madagascar, and post-colonial Africa (Chad, Djibouti,
etc.).

Key theatres:
• Algeria: conquest and pacification; Sidi Bel Abbès as Legion
  headquarters (until 1962)
• Indochina: Dien Bien Phu (1954)—Legion units in the garrison;
  defeat and captivity
• Africa: continued presence (Djibouti, Sahel, etc.) after
  decolonization

The Legion is **empire's sharp edge**—deployed where France will
not or cannot send conscripts; casualties borne by foreigners.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. DIEN BIEN PHU AND DECOLONIZATION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
At Dien Bien Phu (1954), Legion units form part of the besieged
garrison. Defeat ends French Indochina and signals the end of
colonial empire. The Legion survives—redeployed to Algeria, then
(with Algerian independence, 1962) relocated to metropolitan France
and remaining overseas bases.

The Legion outlives empire—but it is **the child of empire**. Its
identity is forged in Algeria, Indochina, and Africa; its myth
(Camerone) is colonial. Post-1962, the Legion serves France in
expeditionary and overseas roles without a colony to call home.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Legion encodes **Francia's use of the foreign to serve the
national**: loyalty purchased through belonging, sacrifice without
political stake, and empire fought by those who have no nation.

Lessons:
• France can mobilize foreigners to fight for French interests.
• Identity can be institutional—"Legio Patria Nostra"—not ethnic
  or civic in the republican sense.
• The Legion is empire's instrument and empire's heir; it survives
  decolonization by relocating, not by disappearing.

IX. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Legion founded 1831 for Algeria; colonial by design.
• "Legio Patria Nostra"; identity through institution, not nation.
• Camerone (1863): founding myth; sacrifice to the last.
• Empire's sharp edge: Algeria, Indochina, Africa; Dien Bien Phu.
• Legion outlives empire; post-1962 relocated, expeditionary.

Tension preserved without verdict.
