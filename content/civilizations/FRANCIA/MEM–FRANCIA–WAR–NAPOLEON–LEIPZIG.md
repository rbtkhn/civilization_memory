I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves Leipzig as **Francia's demonstration that extraction-based
hegemonic systems collapse through defection cascade**: the battle where
Napoleon's satellite forces transferred to the coalition, producing force-ratio
inversion that exceeded attrition arithmetic.

For Francia, Leipzig represents **the limit of declarative authority**—the
moment when AXIOM FRANCIA-005 becomes visible: declarative authority binds
only the destinationless, and by October 1813, destinations had appeared.

For GERMANIA, Leipzig represents liberation and legitimacy restoration—the
Völkerschlacht that ended French domination and enabled national awakening.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. STRATEGIC CONTEXT: EXTRACTION SYSTEM UNDER STRESS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
By autumn 1813, Napoleon's extraction system is failing.

Conditions:
• Russia 1812: ~600,000 entered, ~27,000 effective survivors
• German satellite forces in Russia: ~90% casualties
• Extraction costs now visible to satellite elites
• Austria joins coalition (August 1813)
• Prussia and Russia already engaged (since February 1813)

David A. Bell frames the strategic situation:

"The catastrophe in Russia did not merely destroy an army; it revealed the
true costs of the Napoleonic system to all who participated in it. The
German princes who had supplied contingents to the Grande Armée now faced
the arithmetic of their losses. The Bavarians sent 30,000 men to Russia;
3,000 returned. The Saxons, the Württembergers, the Westphalians—all
suffered proportionally. By 1813, the question was not whether to remain
loyal to Napoleon, but whether defection could be accomplished safely."
— David A. Bell, *The First Total War* (2007)

The liability ledger is now visible. SYNTHESIS 0005's preconditions align.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. INTELLIGENCE DEGRADATION: THE SYSTEM FAILS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Leipzig shows Napoleon's intelligence apparatus in decline.

John Keegan's *Intelligence in War* traces the degradation:

The 1806 system vs. 1813 reality:
• 1806: Elite light cavalry provided continuous reconnaissance
• 1813: Cavalry losses in Russia unrecovered
• 1806: Napoleon concentrated faster than enemy could react
• 1813: Coalition used his own methods against him

"By 1813, Napoleon's intelligence system was a shadow of itself.
The light cavalry that had screened his movements, located the
enemy, and prevented surprise—most had died in Russia. The bataillon
carré required cavalry to function; without it, Napoleon moved
blind. At Leipzig, he did not know the coalition's full strength
until the armies were already concentrated against him. The
intelligence advantage that had produced Jena was now reversed."
— John Keegan, *Intelligence in War* (2003)

The coalition learned:
• Trachenberg Plan used Napoleon's concentration principle
• Multiple armies avoided battle until combined
• Coalition cavalry now provided superior intelligence
• The student had surpassed the master

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. FORCE RATIO DYNAMICS: COALITION CONCENTRATION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Leipzig inverts the force-ratio logic that served Francia since Austerlitz.

The coalition achieves what Napoleon had achieved at Austerlitz:
• Strategic coordination (Trachenberg Plan)
• Operational concentration at decision point
• Avoidance of Napoleon directly until mass achieved
• Convergence of multiple armies on single objective

T.C.W. Blanning explains the Trachenberg strategy:

"The Trachenberg Plan, agreed by the allies in July 1813, was the antithesis
of Napoleon's preferred approach. Instead of seeking decisive battle, the
coalition armies were to avoid engagement with Napoleon personally,
attacking only his marshals. When Napoleon moved against one army, it
would retreat while the others advanced. Only when all three main armies—
Schwarzenberg's Bohemian, Blücher's Silesian, and Bernadotte's Northern—
could converge would they accept battle. At Leipzig, this strategy reached
its culmination: Napoleon was fixed by one army while the others completed
the encirclement."
— T.C.W. Blanning, *The Pursuit of Glory* (2007)

The coalition learned concentration from Napoleon and applied it against him.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. THE FOUR-DAY BATTLE: ATTRITION AND CONVERGENCE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Leipzig unfolds as progressive coalition advantage.

Day 1 (16 October): Initial engagement
• Both sides attack; French hold but cannot break through
• Coalition suffers higher casualties but has reserves
• French ~177,000 vs Coalition ~257,000

Day 2 (17 October): Operational pause
• Both sides consolidate
• Coalition reinforcements arrive
• French cannot be reinforced

Day 3 (18 October): Coalition convergence complete
• Bernadotte's Northern Army arrives (former French marshal)
• Coalition now ~365,000 vs French ~150,000 (attrition + no reinforcement)
• French line contracts

Day 4 (19 October): Collapse and retreat
• Saxon contingent defects mid-battle (critical moment)
• Premature bridge demolition traps French rearguard
• Napoleon retreats toward Rhine

Andrew Roberts describes the defection:

"The Saxon defection on October 18-19 was the visible manifestation of the
system's collapse. As the Saxon cavalry and artillery crossed to coalition
lines during the battle, they demonstrated what the entire campaign had
revealed: the satellite forces were never truly French. They had fought
for Napoleon while no alternative existed; the moment a viable alternative
appeared, they calculated their interests and acted accordingly."
— Andrew Roberts, *Napoleon: A Life* (2014)

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. DEFECTION CASCADE: BARNES MECHANISM IN ACTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Leipzig demonstrates SYNTHESIS 0005's compound mechanism.

The sequence:
1. **Extraction costs visible** (Russia 1812 casualties)
2. **Legitimacy destination appears** (Coalition membership offered)
3. **Satellite forces calculate** (paper divisions → defection decision)
4. **Defection produces transfer** (2x swing: subtract from Napoleon, add to coalition)
5. **Cascade outpaces coercion** (Napoleon cannot punish while retreating)

Force ratio swing from defection:
• Saxon cavalry defection: ~3,000 troops = ~6,000 effective swing
• Württemberg units: additional thousands
• Post-battle German dissolution: Confederation of Rhine collapses entirely

Henry Kissinger analyzes the legitimacy dimension:

"Leipzig ended not just a battle but a system. The Confederation of the
Rhine, which had given legal form to French hegemony in Germany, simply
dissolved. Its members rushed to join the coalition, each seeking to
preserve as much as possible by arriving before the final settlement.
What had been Napoleon's greatest diplomatic achievement—the reorganization
of Germany under French sponsorship—became his greatest liability as
former clients calculated that their futures lay with his enemies."
— Henry Kissinger, *Diplomacy* (1994)

RLL–FRANCIA–0010 (satellite state defection threshold) is validated:
states with pre-existing legitimacy (Bavaria, Saxony) could defect;
pure Napoleonic creations (Westphalia) collapsed instead.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. DECLARATIVE AUTHORITY LIMIT: AXIOM FRANCIA-005
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Leipzig demonstrates AXIOM FRANCIA-005's core claim:
*Declarative authority binds only the destinationless.*

Before Russia 1812:
• Satellite princes had no destination
• Coalition weak, Austria neutral, Russia distant
• Napoleonic condemnation carried real threat
• Declaration bound because alternatives absent

After Russia 1812:
• Coalition offers membership terms
• Defection = survival; loyalty = continued extraction
• Napoleonic condemnation cannot reach defectors
• Declaration fails because destinations exist

Jean Tulard explains the legitimacy collapse:

"Leipzig revealed that Napoleonic authority in Germany had always rested
on a foundation of coercion rather than consent. The German princes had
accepted French hegemony because resistance seemed futile and accommodation
profitable. The moment resistance became viable—and profitable—they
abandoned Napoleon with the same calculation that had led them to submit.
The system had no reserves of loyalty to draw upon."
— Jean Tulard, *Napoleon: The Myth of the Saviour* (1984)

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. INVERSE AUSTERLITZ: STRUCTURAL MIRROR
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Leipzig is Austerlitz's structural inverse.

| Dimension | Austerlitz (1805) | Leipzig (1813) |
|-----------|-------------------|----------------|
| Force ratio | French inferior globally, superior locally | French inferior globally and locally |
| Concentration | Napoleon concentrates | Coalition concentrates |
| Coalition | Aggregates, doesn't coordinate | Coordinates (Trachenberg Plan) |
| Defection | Coalition armies disagree | French satellites defect |
| Outcome | Coalition shattered | French hegemony shattered |
| Legitimacy | Napoleon's authority validated | Napoleon's authority collapsed |

At Austerlitz, Napoleon manufactured local superiority from global inferiority.
At Leipzig, the coalition manufactured the same—using Napoleon's own methods.

The lesson Napoleon taught at Austerlitz (concentration defeats aggregation)
was learned and applied against him at Leipzig.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VIII. CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Leipzig becomes **the warning ignored**.

For Francia, it encodes:
• Extraction systems have limits
• Satellite loyalty is transactional
• Declarative authority fails when destinations appear
• The coalition learned Francia's own methods

But Francia's axiom structure (declarative legitimacy, rupture-as-renewal)
processes Leipzig as external failure, not systemic limit:
• "Napoleon overextended" (contingent, not structural)
• "The marshals failed" (individual, not systemic)
• "The coalition cheated" (unfair, not logical)

DOCTRINE v0.5 (Legitimacy-Capacity Oscillator) predicts this:
Francia resolves claim-capacity divergence through defeat and reset,
not through systemic learning.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IX. CROSS-CIVILIZATIONAL DIVERGENCE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
FRANCIA encodes Leipzig as: external defeat requiring renewal.
GERMANIA encodes Leipzig as: liberation, Völkerschlacht, national awakening.
RUSSIA encodes Leipzig as: validation of 1812 endurance strategy.

The divergence structures post-Napoleonic memory:
• Francia: Leipzig is humiliation to be avenged (→ 1870 anxiety)
• Germania: Leipzig is liberation to be celebrated (national holiday until 1871)
• Russia: Leipzig is partnership in victory (Vienna settlement partner)

SDI implication: Same battle, three civilizational readings.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
X. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Extraction systems collapse when liability becomes visible and destinations appear.
• Defection produces force transfer (2x swing), not mere attrition.
• Coalition learned concentration from Napoleon and applied it against him.
• Satellite loyalty is transactional; it ends when alternatives appear.
• Declarative authority binds only the destinationless (AXIOM FRANCIA-005).
• The same battle produces opposite memory functions across civilizations.
• Francia's axiom structure prevents systemic learning from Leipzig.
• Leipzig inverts Austerlitz structurally: same mechanism, opposite outcome.
• Mid-battle defection (Saxony) demonstrates cascade timing.
• The coalition's Trachenberg Plan represents organizational learning.

Contradictions preserved without verdict.

This MEM directly grounds:

SYNTHESIS 0005 (Extraction Collapse Mechanism):
• Leipzig validates compound mechanism: visibility → destination → defection → transfer
• Saxon defection is paradigm case of mid-battle force transfer
• Force-ratio inversion exceeds attrition arithmetic

• Napoleon's preconditions (interior lines, unified command, extraction) all failed

RLL–FRANCIA–0010 (Satellite State Defection Threshold):
• Saxony (pre-existing legitimacy) → defected, partitioned
• Bavaria (pre-existing) → defected early, preserved
• Westphalia (Napoleonic creation) → collapsed entirely
