I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves Pepin III (the Short) as **Francia's dynastic-transfer
moment**: the ruler whose anointing (751) by papal sanction replaced the
Merovingian line with the Carolingian while reusing the same sacral
channel—Church recognition of the ruler—that Clovis had established.
Legitimacy is **re-authored, not destroyed**.

For Francia, Pepin encodes **dynastic replacement as continuity**: the
mayor who becomes king not by conquest alone but by ecclesiastical
conferral. The ritual chain (Clovis baptism → Pepin anointing →
Charlemagne coronation → Capetian/Valois at Reims) passes through him.
AXIOM FRANCIA-003 and doctrine 03 (rupture enables renewal when grammar
survives) have in Pepin their first full dynastic test.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. CONTEXT: MAYORAL POWER AND MEROVINGIAN DECAY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
By the mid-8th century, Merovingian kings retain sacral symbolism but
real power rests with the mayors of the palace. Pepin's father, Charles
Martel, had secured military prestige (notably Tours 732); Pepin and his
brother Carloman run the realm.

Structural conditions:
• Last Merovingian (Childeric III) is a figurehead
• Papacy seeks a reliable Frankish protector against Lombard pressure
• Anointing as king would convert de facto power into sacral legitimacy
• The Church alone can confer that conversion without inventing a new grammar

John Keegan frames the succession in terms of demonstrated capacity:

> "Charles Martel earned his epithet—Martellus, the Hammer—at Tours.
> That victory gave him the prestige to dominate Francia despite not
> being king. His son Pepin could depose the Merovingians because the
> family had proven themselves militarily."
> — John Keegan, *A History of Warfare* (1993) (ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-SECONDARY]

Military proof is necessary but not sufficient. Pepin seeks **papal
sanction** so that the new dynasty is legible as legitimate, not merely
strong.

III. 751: ANOINTING AND DYNASTIC REPLACEMENT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
In 751 Pepin is anointed king of the Franks; the last Merovingian is
deposed (and often tonsured). The act is performed with ecclesiastical
authority—sources attribute the anointing to Saint Boniface or to papal
legates, and the Pope (Zacharias or his successor Stephen II) is
understood to have authorized the transfer of royal dignity to the
Carolingian line.

The critical civilizational move: **the same channel that had sustained
Merovingian legitimacy (Church endorsement) is used to transfer it**.
No new source of legitimacy is invented; the grammar (sacral recognition
of the ruler) is reused. Legitimacy is re-authored, not destroyed—the
template already present in MEM–FRANCIA–DYNASTY–MEROVINGIAN (dynastic
transfer sanctified) is executed.

From a structural perspective, papal sanction resolves the coordination
problem: elites and Church align on a single claimant, and the former
dynasty is retired without prolonged civil war. The ritual concentrates
authority in one act, one moment.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. RITUAL CHAIN: CLOVIS → PEPIN → CHARLEMAGNE → CAPETIAN/VALOIS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Pepin occupies the second link in the ritual chain that other Francia
MEMs record. Clovis's baptism (Reims, tradition) established that one
ritual in one place could confer legitimacy; Pepin's anointing (751)
establishes that the **same type of act** (ecclesiastical recognition
of the ruler) can **transfer** legitimacy from one dynasty to another.
Charlemagne's imperial coronation (800) then extends the same logic to
empire; Capetian and Valois coronations at Reims continue the chain.

Reims is the fixed site for later coronations; 751 may be associated
with Soissons or another site in the sources, but the **type** of act—
anointing by Church authority—is consistent. The channel persists.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Dynastic replacement can be sanctified through the same sacral channel
  that sustained the previous dynasty.
• Legitimacy re-authored, not destroyed: Pepin as first full dynastic
  test for AXIOM FRANCIA-003 / doctrine 03.
• Papal sanction resolves coordination; one ritual concentrates authority.
• Pepin links military proof (Tours, Martel) to sacral legitimacy (anointing).
• Ritual chain: Clovis (baptism) → Pepin (anointing 751) → Charlemagne
  (800) → Capetian/Valois (Reims).

Tension preserved without verdict.
