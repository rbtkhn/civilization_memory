I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves the French Navy as **Francia's demonstration
that continental powers cannot sustain maritime competition with
island nations**: the institution that repeatedly approached naval
greatness only to be sacrificed to continental priorities.

For Francia, the Navy encodes **the impossibility of dual identity**—
the recurring discovery that France cannot simultaneously be Europe's
dominant land power and a global maritime empire. Each generation
relearns this lesson.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. RICHELIEU'S FOUNDATION: THE CONTINENTAL PARADOX
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Cardinal Richelieu creates the modern French Navy (1624).

The vision:
• France must have Atlantic AND Mediterranean fleets
• Naval power essential for colonial expansion
• Compete with Dutch and English maritime trade
• Protect French coasts from Habsburg naval threat

The paradox emerges immediately:

"Richelieu understood that France needed a navy, but he also
understood that France was primarily a land power. The armies
that fought the Habsburgs in Germany, Italy, and Spain consumed
resources that might have built ships. Every crisis on the continent
drained the naval budget. The French Navy was always the residual—
what remained after the armies were fed."
— John Keegan, *The Price of Admiralty* (1988)

The structural constraint is permanent: France's continental borders
demand priority; naval power is a luxury affordable only in peace.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. COLBERT'S NAVY: THE ZENITH (1669-1690)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Jean-Baptiste Colbert builds France's greatest fleet.

Colbert's achievement:
• Fleet expands from 20 to 270 ships
• Arsenals at Brest, Toulon, Rochefort
• Professional officer corps established
• Inscription maritime (conscription system)
• By 1690: French Navy matches combined Anglo-Dutch

The Battle of Beachy Head (1690):

"At Beachy Head, the French fleet under Tourville defeated the
combined English and Dutch fleets—the only time in the age of sail
that France achieved clear naval superiority in the Channel. For
a moment, invasion of England seemed possible. Louis XIV did not
exploit the victory; the army was committed elsewhere. Within two
years, the moment had passed forever."
— N.A.M. Rodger, *The Command of the Ocean* (2004)

Colbert's navy proved that France *could* compete. It also proved
that France *would not* sustain the competition.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. LA HOUGUE AND DECLINE (1692)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Battle of La Hougue ends French naval primacy.

29 May – 4 June 1692:
• Tourville attacks with 44 ships against 82 Anglo-Dutch
• Tactical defeat; 15 French ships destroyed
• Louis XIV never again attempts Channel battle
• Shift to guerre de course (commerce raiding)

The strategic retreat:

"After La Hougue, France abandoned the battle fleet strategy.
Building and maintaining ships-of-the-line was ruinously expensive;
the armies always needed money more urgently. Louis XIV turned to
commerce raiding—privateers attacking English trade. It was cheaper,
less decisive, and acknowledged that France could not match British
sea power in fleet action. The decision shaped French naval strategy
for a century."
— John Keegan, *The Price of Admiralty* (1988)

Guerre de course becomes Francia's naval identity: the weapon of
the weaker maritime power.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. THE SEVEN YEARS' WAR: NAVAL COLLAPSE (1756-1763)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Naval inferiority loses Francia's first colonial empire.

The sequence:
• Lagos (1759): Mediterranean fleet destroyed
• Quiberon Bay (1759): Atlantic fleet destroyed
• Quebec (1759): Canada lost (no fleet to relieve)
• Treaty of Paris (1763): colonial empire ceded

The calculation:

"The Seven Years' War demonstrated the consequences of naval
inferiority. British fleets swept French trade from the seas,
blockaded French ports, and prevented reinforcement of the colonies.
France chose to prioritize the German war—subsidies to Frederick's
enemies, armies on the Rhine—over fleet construction. The result
was predictable: France won battles in Germany and lost an empire
in America."
— John Keegan, *Fields of Battle* (1996)

Continental priority produces colonial loss—the pattern is established.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. YORKTOWN: THE EXCEPTIONAL MOMENT (1781)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
De Grasse achieves what French admirals rarely achieve.

The Battle of the Chesapeake (5 September 1781):
• De Grasse defeats British Admiral Graves
• French fleet controls Chesapeake Bay
• Cornwallis cannot be evacuated
• Yorktown siege becomes possible

The exception that proves the rule:

"Yorktown required naval supremacy, and for once, France achieved it.
De Grasse's fleet, larger than any France had deployed in American
waters, caught the British at a moment of division and defeated them.
It was the decisive moment of the war—and it was unrepeatable. The
financial cost of maintaining such a fleet bankrupted the monarchy.
France would not again achieve naval superiority over Britain until
the age of nuclear submarines."
— John Keegan, *Fields of Battle* (1996)

Yorktown demonstrates capability; it also demonstrates the cost.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. TRAFALGAR: NAVAL DEATH (1805)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Trafalgar destroys French naval power for a century.

21 October 1805:
• Franco-Spanish fleet annihilated
• 22 ships lost; British lost none
• Naval invasion of Britain impossible forever
• Napoleon forced to Continental System

The permanent consequence:

"Trafalgar did not merely destroy a fleet; it destroyed the will
to rebuild one. For the remainder of the nineteenth century, France
never seriously attempted to challenge British naval supremacy.
Colonial expansion in Africa and Asia was conducted with British
acquiescence; any conflict with Britain meant naval defeat. The
memory of Trafalgar constrained French policy for a hundred years."
— John Keegan, *The Price of Admiralty* (1988)

After Trafalgar, France is permanently a continental power that
happens to have a coastline.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VIII. WORLD WAR II: TRAGEDY AT MERS-EL-KÉBIR (1940)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The French fleet is destroyed by its former ally.

3 July 1940:
• France has surrendered; fleet at Mers-el-Kébir (Algeria)
• Britain fears fleet will fall to Germany
• Churchill orders attack
• ~1,300 French sailors killed
• French fleet largely destroyed

The trauma:

"Mers-el-Kébir was one of the most painful episodes in Franco-British
relations. Churchill ordered the attack believing—correctly or not—
that the French fleet might be used by Germany. The French, already
humiliated by defeat, now saw their ships destroyed by their ally.
Admiral Darlan, who had promised the fleet would never fall to
Germany, felt betrayed. The memory poisoned Vichy-British relations
and echoed in French strategic culture for decades."
— Robert Tombs and Isabelle Tombs, *That Sweet Enemy* (2006)

27 November 1942: Fleet scuttled at Toulon
• Rather than fall to Germany (occupying Vichy zone)
• 77 ships sunk by their own crews
• Final act of the surface fleet

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IX. NUCLEAR RENAISSANCE: FORCE DE FRAPPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The submarine force provides strategic independence.

Post-1945 transformation:
• Surface fleet reduced to secondary status
• Nuclear submarines (SSBN) become strategic deterrent
• Force océanique stratégique: 4 ballistic missile submarines
• Independence from NATO/US nuclear umbrella

The new role:

"De Gaulle understood that nuclear weapons transformed naval power.
A fleet of surface ships would always be inferior to the American
or British; but four nuclear submarines carrying strategic missiles
made France an independent nuclear power. The Marine Nationale
became the platform for strategic autonomy—not through fleet battles
but through deterrence. The centuries-old problem of maritime
inferiority was solved by going underwater."
— Philip H. Gordon, *A Certain Idea of France* (1993)

The submarine force achieves what Colbert's fleet could not:
permanent strategic relevance independent of British/American power.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
X. CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Navy encodes **continental identity confirmed by maritime failure**.

For Francia, the Navy demonstrates:
• France cannot sustain maritime competition with island nations
• Continental priorities always drain naval resources
• Exceptional moments (Beachy Head, Yorktown) are unrepeatable
• Colonial empire requires naval power France cannot maintain
• Nuclear submarines solve the problem through asymmetry

The recurring pattern:
1. Investment in fleet during peace
2. Continental crisis drains resources
3. Naval defeat confirms inferiority
4. Colonial losses follow
5. Reset; pattern repeats

DOCTRINE v0.4 (Post-Hegemonic Strategic Anxiety) includes maritime:
France's inability to match Anglo-Saxon sea power produces anxiety
about global reach, masked by universalist rhetoric.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
XI. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Continental powers cannot sustain maritime competition with islands.
• French naval excellence (Colbert, Beachy Head) could not be maintained.
• Guerre de course (commerce raiding) = strategy of the weaker power.
• Every continental crisis drained the naval budget.
• Seven Years' War proved naval inferiority loses colonies.
• Yorktown was exceptional, expensive, and unrepeatable.
• Trafalgar ended fleet ambitions for a century.
• Mers-el-Kébir and Toulon = WWII trauma.
• Nuclear submarines solved the problem through asymmetry.
• France is continental; maritime identity is aspiration, not reality.

Contradictions preserved without verdict.
