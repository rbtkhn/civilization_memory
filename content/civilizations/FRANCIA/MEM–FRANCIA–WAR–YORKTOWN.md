I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves Yorktown as **Francia's revenge for Quebec**:
the battle where French arms secured American independence and
humiliated Britain, reversing the verdict of the Seven Years' War.

For Francia, Yorktown is **vindication**—proof that France could
still project power across the Atlantic, defeat Britain, and reshape
the world order. The victory was also financially ruinous, contributing
to the fiscal crisis that produced 1789.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. STRATEGIC CONTEXT: REVENGE AND REVOLUTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
France intervenes to weaken Britain, not for ideological solidarity.

French motivations:
• Revenge for Seven Years' War humiliation
• Weaken British commercial and naval power
• Restore French prestige and influence
• No ideological commitment to republicanism

Vergennes's calculation:

"The French intervention in America was not about liberty; it was
about revenge. Vergennes, Louis XVI's foreign minister, saw the
American rebellion as an opportunity to weaken Britain, France's
great rival. Every ship Britain sent to America was one not facing
France in the Channel. Every pound spent on the American war was
one not spent on the British fleet. The Americans were useful
instruments; their cause was secondary."
— John Keegan, *Fields of Battle* (1996)

The intervention would succeed strategically and fail financially.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. THE FRENCH CONTRIBUTION: DECISIVE FORCE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
French forces provide the margin of victory.

French contributions:
• Rochambeau's army: 5,500 regulars (expanded to 8,800)
• De Grasse's fleet: 28 ships of the line
• Siege artillery and engineering expertise
• Financial subsidies to Continental Army
• Naval control of Chesapeake (critical)

The quality differential:

"The French army at Yorktown was the best-trained, best-equipped
force in the campaign. Rochambeau's regiments were regulars of
the Royal Army—professionals with decades of European warfare
experience. Washington's Continentals, while battle-hardened, lacked
the siege expertise the French provided. The French engineers
directed the siege works; French artillery breached the British
defenses. Without the French, Yorktown could not have happened."
— John Keegan, *Fields of Battle* (1996)

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. DE GRASSE AND NAVAL SUPREMACY: THE CRITICAL FACTOR
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
French naval control enables the siege.

The Battle of the Chesapeake (5 September 1781):
• De Grasse defeats British Admiral Graves
• British fleet withdraws to New York
• Cornwallis cannot be evacuated or reinforced
• French control of sea makes siege possible

Keegan emphasizes the naval dimension:

"Yorktown was decided at sea before the siege began. When de Grasse's
fleet defeated Graves at the Battle of the Chesapeake, Cornwallis
was doomed. He had retreated to Yorktown expecting the Royal Navy
to evacuate him or bring reinforcement. The navy failed; the French
controlled the bay. Cornwallis sat trapped between Washington and
Rochambeau on land and de Grasse at sea. The siege was formality;
the battle at sea was decisive."
— John Keegan, *Fields of Battle* (1996)

For Francia, this naval victory was exceptional—French sea power
rarely matched British. Yorktown proved it could be done.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. THE SIEGE: EUROPEAN WARFARE IN AMERICA
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Yorktown is a classic European siege operation.

The sequence:
• 28 September: Allied forces arrive, begin investment
• 6-9 October: First parallel (trenches) completed
• 9 October: Allied artillery bombardment begins
• 11 October: Second parallel begun
• 14 October: Redoubts 9 and 10 stormed
• 16 October: Cornwallis's sortie fails
• 17 October: Cornwallis requests terms
• 19 October: British surrender

The French engineering role:

"The siege of Yorktown was a textbook operation, conducted by men
who had read the textbook. French engineers—trained in the Vauban
tradition of siege warfare—directed the construction of parallels
and batteries. The British defenses, hastily constructed, could
not withstand systematic bombardment. When Redoubts 9 and 10 fell
on October 14—stormed by French and American troops respectively—
the siege was effectively over. Cornwallis could not hold without
those outworks."
— John Keegan, *Fields of Battle* (1996)

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. THE SURRENDER: BRITISH HUMILIATION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Cornwallis surrenders 7,000 men—Britain's main southern army.

The ceremony (19 October 1781):
• British march out with colors cased
• Band allegedly plays "The World Turned Upside Down"
• Cornwallis claims illness; sends deputy
• French and Americans form parallel lines
• British surrender arms

The symbolic weight:

"Cornwallis's surrender was more than tactical defeat; it was
strategic catastrophe. Britain had lost an entire field army in
America. The will to continue the war evaporated in Parliament.
Lord North, receiving the news, reportedly exclaimed, 'Oh God!
It is all over!' Within months, the British government had opened
peace negotiations. Yorktown did not merely end a campaign; it
ended a war and an empire."
— John Keegan, *Fields of Battle* (1996)

For Francia, the humiliation of Britain was the objective achieved.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. FRENCH COSTS: VICTORY THAT BANKRUPTED THE KINGDOM
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The American war drains the French treasury.

The financial burden:
• Total French expenditure: ~1.3 billion livres
• Annual French revenue: ~475 million livres
• Debt service becomes unsustainable
• Necker's loans defer crisis but deepen it
• By 1788, debt service consumes 50% of revenue

The unintended consequence:

"France won the American war and lost its monarchy. The financial
cost of intervention—the fleet, the army, the subsidies to America—
pushed the already strained French treasury past breaking point.
Vergennes got his revenge on Britain; Louis XVI got the Revolution.
The American officers who served with Rochambeau—Lafayette above
all—brought home ideas that would prove fatal to the regime that
had sent them."
— Simon Schama, *Citizens: A Chronicle of the French Revolution* (1989)

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VIII. CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Yorktown encodes **revenge achieved at self-destructive cost**.

For Francia, Yorktown demonstrates:
• France can still project global power
• Britain can be humbled through coalition
• Naval supremacy can be achieved (temporarily)
• BUT: victory's cost can exceed victory's value

The paradox:
• Quebec (1759): France loses colony, survives as kingdom
• Yorktown (1781): France wins war, monarchy collapses (1789)

AXIOM FRANCIA-002 (Universalism-Capacity Divergence) manifests:
France's claim to great power status (defeating Britain) exceeds
capacity to sustain the effort. The gap between claim and capacity
produces internal collapse.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IX. LAFAYETTE AND THE REVOLUTIONARY VECTOR
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
French officers return with revolutionary ideas.

The transmission:
• Lafayette serves 1777-1781
• Returns as hero; commands National Guard (1789)
• American example cited in revolutionary debates
• Declaration of Rights of Man echoes Declaration of Independence

The ideological contamination:

"Lafayette came to America a young nobleman seeking glory; he
returned a convinced republican. He was not alone. The French
officers who served in America saw a society without aristocratic
privilege, without royal absolutism, without the weight of centuries.
When they returned to France, they brought ideas that proved
incompatible with the regime that had sent them. Yorktown was
France's military victory; it was also the vector by which
revolutionary ideas entered the French elite."
— John Keegan, *Fields of Battle* (1996)

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
