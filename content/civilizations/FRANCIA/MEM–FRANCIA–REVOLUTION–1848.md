I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves the Revolution of 1848 as **Francia’s archetypal
universalist shock without material resolution**: a moment when moral
authority, popular legitimacy, and republican declaration surged faster
than administrative capacity, coercive coherence, or economic stability.

Descartes had supplied the rationalist ground on which revolutionary certainty would later stand:

> "Never to accept anything as true that I did not know evidently to be so."
> — Descartes, *Discours de la méthode* (1637) (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD) [ERC-CONTEXTUAL]

Rousseau had supplied the grammar 1848 would invoke:

> "Man is born free; and everywhere he is in chains."
> — Rousseau, *Du contrat social* (1762) (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD) [ERC-CONTEXTUAL]

1848 is not a successful revolution.
It is a **revealed mismatch**.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

II. FEBRUARY COLLAPSE OF THE JULY MONARCHY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The July Monarchy collapses rapidly under legitimacy erosion.

Drivers:
• Electoral exclusion
• Economic distress
• Banquet campaign politicization
• Symbolic exhaustion of bourgeois monarchy

Alphonse de Lamartine captures the moral tone:

> “The monarchy had ceased to be believed in before it ceased to be
> obeyed. Power fell because it no longer represented either justice
> or the future.”  
> — Lamartine, *Histoire de la Révolution de 1848*

Legitimacy evaporates faster than force is applied.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. REPUBLICAN DECLARATION AS MORAL ASSERTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Second Republic is proclaimed immediately.

Characteristics:
• Universal male suffrage
• Symbolic fraternity
• Moral language precedes policy
• Institutions improvised under pressure

Lamartine again emphasizes declaration over consolidation:

> “The Republic was not established by force of arms but by the
> irresistible force of public opinion, which proclaimed it before
> it could be organized.”  
> — Lamartine, speech at the Hôtel de Ville, February 1848

Authority is asserted before it is structured.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. SOCIAL REPUBLIC & CAPACITY FAILURE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Republic promises social transformation without fiscal base.

Policies:
• National Workshops
• Right to work rhetoric
• State-backed employment guarantees

Alexis de Tocqueville warns of instability:

> “The people believed they were founding a society of equality, while
> the government was only improvising expedients. From this confusion
> arose fear, then hatred, and finally civil war.”  
> — Tocqueville, *Souvenirs*, written 1850–51

Universalism outruns administration.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. JUNE DAYS: INTERNAL WAR
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Closure of National Workshops triggers uprising.

Outcomes:
• Class conflict replaces republican unity
• Army restores order through force
• Moral authority fractures irreversibly

General Cavaignac reports bluntly:

> “It was necessary to choose between society and insurrection. The
> Republic defended itself against those who claimed to act in its
> name while destroying its foundations.”  
> — Cavaignac, National Assembly address, July 1848

Republic survives by negating its own rhetoric.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. FROM UNIVERSALISM TO AUTHORITY SUBSTITUTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Post-1848 dynamics:
• Fear of mass politics
• Demand for order
• Rise of plebiscitary legitimacy

Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte exploits exhaustion:

> “France desires repose, and it will find it only in authority.”  
> — Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte, presidential address, 1849

Universal suffrage delivers personal power.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1848 encodes **the trauma of universalism without capacity**.

Lessons:
• Moral declaration accelerates expectation.
• Social promises require coercive and fiscal backing.
• Failure imprints long-term anxiety toward mass politics.
• Francia oscillates from idealism to authority substitution.

1848 teaches fear, not confidence.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VIII. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Declaration precedes capacity in French revolutions.
• Universalism generates internal escalation pressure.
• Social republic collapses under fiscal reality.
• Order is restored through personal authority.
• 1848 hardens post-hegemonic strategic anxiety.

Tension preserved without verdict.
