I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves Languedoc as **Francia's medieval southern frontier**:
first the site of crusade and Cathar suppression (1209–1229), then the
theatre in which royal authority expanded through negotiation and
cooperation as much as through force (1250–1400).

For Francia, Languedoc encodes **legitimacy through incorporation**—by
crusade and inquisition, then by local elite complicity with royal
administration. The south enters the kingdom by rupture and is held by
cooperation.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

II. CONTEXT: THE MIDI BEFORE THE CRUSADE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Before the Albigensian Crusade, the Midi was a distinct cultural and
political space.

Conditions (12th c.):
• Occitan culture; weak central authority
• Cathar (Albigensian) heresy widespread among nobility and towns
• Counts of Toulouse and other lords; no Capetian direct rule
• Papacy and northern nobility frame heresy as existential threat

The crusade is called (1208–1209) after the murder of a papal legate;
Innocent III authorizes war against heretics and their protectors.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. THE ALBIGENSIAN CRUSADE (1209–1229)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Northern French and papal forces invade the Midi.

Key dynamics:
• Simon de Montfort leads crusader army; Béziers and Carcassonne fall
• Massacre and dispossession; Cathar strongholds reduced
• Treaty of Paris (1229): Raymond VII of Toulouse cedes much to crown;
  inquisition established
• Royal domain extends into Languedoc; Capetian presence permanent

The crusade **ruptures** the old order. Legitimacy is imposed by force
and religious sanction—heretic elimination and feudal forfeiture. The
south is incorporated by conquest, then administered.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. POST-CRUSADE: ROYAL AUTHORITY AND LOCAL COOPERATION (1250–1400)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Verbatim scholarship (ARC-T-MODERN):

"Although it is often assumed that resurgent royal government eliminated
so-called 'private warfare', the French judicial archives reveal nearly
one hundred such wars waged in Languedoc and the Auvergne between the
mid-thirteenth and the end of the fourteenth century. Royal
administrators often intervened in these wars, but not always in order
to suppress 'private violence' in favour of 'public justice'. They
frequently recognised elites' own power and legitimate prerogatives,
and elites were often fully complicit with royal intervention. Much of
the engagement between royal officers and local elites came through
informal processes of negotiation and settlement, rather than through
the imposition of official justice. The expansion of royal authority
was due as much to local cooperation as to conflict, a fact that
ensured its survival during the fourteenth-century crises."
— Justine Firnhaber-Baker, *Violence and the State in Languedoc,
1250–1400* (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2014), abstract
(ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-SECONDARY]

Royal authority in Languedoc after the crusade thus grows **with** local
elites as much as against them. Seigneurial violence persists; royal
officers negotiate, settle, and recognise prerogatives—so that
fourteenth-century crises (Hundred Years' War, plague) do not strip the
crown of the south.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. CIVILIZATIONAL SIGNIFICANCE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
For Francia, Languedoc encodes:

• Rupture by crusade: legitimacy through religious war and forfeiture
• Incorporation by cooperation: post-crusade expansion of royal authority
  via negotiation and elite complicity, not suppression alone
• Regional distinction preserved within the kingdom (Occitan, law, elites)
• Precedent for later royal treatment of periphery (Richelieu, Louis XIV):
  force to break autonomy, then negotiation to hold it

AXIOM FRANCIA-003 (Rupture enables renewal): The crusade **is** rupture;
renewal is the Capetian south. But the renewal that lasts (1250–1400) is
the one built on local cooperation—Firnhaber-Baker's correction to the
narrative of royal monopoly by force alone.
