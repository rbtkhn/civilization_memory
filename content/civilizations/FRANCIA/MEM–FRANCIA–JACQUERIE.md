I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves the Jacquerie of 1358 as **Francia's major medieval
peasant revolt**: a post-Poitiers legitimacy crisis in which rural and
urban rebellion converged, nobles were targeted as a class, and royal
authority reasserted itself through suppression.

For Francia, the Jacquerie is **rupture as popular corrective**—and then
rupture suppressed. It encodes the moment when military defeat (Poitiers),
royal captivity, and fiscal collapse produced not only noble dominance but
popular refusal.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

II. CONTEXT: POST-POITIERS VACUUM
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The revolt erupts in the wake of catastrophic royal defeat.

Conditions (1356–1358):
• King John II captured at Poitiers (1356)
• Ransom and territorial cession (Brétigny 1360) not yet settled
• Estates-General and Parisian reform movement (Étienne Marcel)
• Dauphin Charles struggling for control
• Free Companies ravaging the countryside
• Noble prestige shattered; peasant and urban resentment high

The Jacquerie is not isolated. It is one node in a **constellation of
events**—Paris uprising, noble reaction, royal reconsolidation.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. THE REVOLT: PLANNING AND TARGETS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Verbatim scholarship (ARC-T-MODERN):

"The Jacquerie was not an irrational explosion of peasant fury that
came out of nowhere, but rather carefully planned and executed. It
has to be understood as a constellation of many events that evolved
over time, involving thousands of people with different understandings
of their actions. It was their social status—with its odour of military
failure, material excess, unearned privilege, and moral treachery—that
made the nobility targets."
— Justine Firnhaber-Baker, *The Jacquerie of 1358: A French Peasants'
Revolt* (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2021) (ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-SECONDARY]

The initial massacre of nine noblemen at Saint-Leu-d'Esserent (28 May 1358)
was aimed at keeping those men from garrisoning a castle that would have
threatened Paris—tactical, not random. Ecclesiastical lordships were
largely spared; violence was directed at nobles identified with military
failure and extraction.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. PARIS AND MARCEL: CONVERGENCE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Jacquerie coincides with the Parisian uprising led by Étienne Marcel.

Dynamics:
• Marcel's faction sought constitutional and fiscal reform
• Peasant revolt in the Île-de-France and Beauvaisis
• Temporary alignment of urban and rural grievance against noble and
  royal authority
• Nobles and royal forces (Dauphin, Charles of Navarre) eventually
  crush both Parisian and peasant revolt

The Dauphin suppresses both. Royal authority is reasserted through
violence—legitimacy restored by force.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. SUPPRESSION AND MEMORY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The revolt is crushed within weeks.

Outcomes:
• Mass reprisals against rebels
• Marcel assassinated (July 1358)
• Jacquerie suppressed by noble coalition
• No institutional gain for peasants; no lasting reform

Memory: The Jacquerie enters French historiography as **peasant fury**—
until modern scholarship (Firnhaber-Baker) reframes it as planned, targeted,
and part of a broader legitimacy crisis. DOCTRINE v0.3 (Rupture as Renewal)
applies inversely here: rupture was attempted from below; renewal came from
above, through reassertion of crown and nobility.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. CIVILIZATIONAL SIGNIFICANCE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
For Francia, the Jacquerie encodes:

• Legitimacy crisis following military defeat (Poitiers → vacuum)
• Popular and urban revolt as rupture option—then closed
• Noble status as target when prestige fails (military failure, moral
  treachery)
• Royal-noble coalition restoring order by force

The revolt does not produce renewal from below. It produces **renewal from
above**: the Dauphin and nobility reconsolidate. AXIOM FRANCIA-003 (Rupture
enables renewal) holds for the regime that suppresses the revolt, not for
the rebels.
