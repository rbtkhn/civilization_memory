I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves Paris as **Francia's symbolic and administrative
core**: the capital that rose with the Capetians, was lost to the
English (Treaty of Troyes 1420) and recovered by the Valois (1436),
and became the stage for revolution, Commune, and enduring centralization.

Descartes had relocated certainty from tradition to the thinking subject—a move that would later center Paris as the seat of rationalist authority:

> "I think, therefore I am."
> — Descartes, *Discours de la méthode* (1637) (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD) [ERC-CONTEXTUAL]

Rousseau had framed the citizen-body Paris would claim to embody:

> "The real meaning of the word citizen has been almost wholly lost in modern times; most people mistake a town for a city, and a townsman for a citizen. They do not know that houses make a town, but citizens a city."
> — Rousseau, *Du contrat social* (1762) (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD) [ERC-CONTEXTUAL]

For Francia, Paris encodes **legitimacy through centrality**—the city
that binds crown, administration, and national identity, and whose
loss or capture signifies legitimacy crisis (1420, 1871, 1940).

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

II. CONTEXT: PARIS AND THE CAPETIANS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Paris rises as the Capetian seat and the realm's symbolic center.

Verbatim scholarship (ARC-T-MODERN):

"Notre-Dame emerges from high Capetian consolidation—Paris rising as
the symbolic and administrative core of a realm that had learned to
outlast rivals. Gothic architecture became sacral technology: the
cathedral concentrated legitimacy, binding crown, city, and God in
stone. The building was not merely religious; it was the monarchy's
memory made visible."
— Justine Firnhaber-Baker, *House of Lilies: The Dynasty That Made
Medieval France* (London: Allen Lane, 2024) (ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-SECONDARY]

Paris is thus **legitimacy made spatial**: the city where crown, God,
and administration are concentrated. When the Capetians consolidate,
Paris consolidates with them—symbolic and administrative core of the
realm.

III. HUNDRED YEARS' WAR: LOSS AND RECOVERY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Paris falls to the English and Burgundians (Treaty of Troyes 1420);
the Dauphin withdraws to Bourges. Paris is recovered by Charles VII (1436).

Dynamics:
• Troyes (1420) disinherits the Dauphin; Paris under Anglo-Burgundian control
• Paris as **contested legitimacy arena**—authority exists where it can
  be ritually and militarily defended (Peter Wilson, *Europe's Tragedy*)
• Relief of Orléans (1429), Reims (1429), then gradual recovery of the north
• Paris restored to Valois (1436)—capital again under the anointed king

Paris encodes **loss and recovery**: when the capital is lost, legitimacy
is contested; when it is recovered, the crown's narrative is restored.
The city is the **prize** of the Hundred Years' War's closing phase—as
much as Aquitaine is the territorial stake, Paris is the symbolic one.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. REVOLUTION, COMMUNE, AND CENTRALIZATION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Paris remains the stage for rupture and reassertion.

Events:
• French Revolution (1789)—Paris as cradle (Estates-General, Bastille,
  Jacobins)
• Paris Commune (1871)—Paris as insurgent; then reassertion of central
  authority
• 20th c.: capital of Republic; occupation (1940–1944); liberation

Paris encodes **centrality as vulnerability**: the city that must be
held if the regime is to be legitimate, and that becomes the site of
revolt when legitimacy fractures. Henry Kissinger identifies the
Hundred Years' War period as the foundation of France's later insistence
that **authority must never again be allowed to fragment** (*Diplomacy*)—
Paris is the node that must not be lost.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. CIVILIZATIONAL SIGNIFICANCE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
For Francia, Paris encodes:

• Symbolic and administrative core—the city that binds crown, God, and
  state (Firnhaber-Baker, House of Lilies)
• Loss as legitimacy crisis (1420, 1871, 1940); recovery as legitimacy
  restoration (1436, Commune suppressed, Liberation)
• Centralization as civilizational choice—Paris as the node that must
  hold; authority must not fragment

SYNTHESIS 0004 and RLL–FRANCIA–0011: Paris is the **symbol carrier**
in spatial form—when the Valois hold only the south (Bourges, Orléans),
Paris is lost; when they recover Paris (1436), the legitimacy grammar
is again anchored in the capital. The city outlasts regime change
(Notre-Dame, MEM–FRANCIA–PARIS–NOTRE–DAME) while remaining the indispensable
locus of legitimacy.
