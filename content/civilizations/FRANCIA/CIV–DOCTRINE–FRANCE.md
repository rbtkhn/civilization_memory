I. PURPOSE & AUTHORITY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file is the **exclusive registry of doctrines that guide and
govern the actions of the French state**.

Doctrine guides state action; civilizations are not unified actors
and do not "follow" doctrine. The state (France) is the actor that
is guided by these doctrines. The doctrines are derived from the
FRANCIA civilizational corpus (CIV–SCHOLAR–FRANCE, MEMs).

It contains:
• Doctrines explicitly frozen in CIV–SCHOLAR–FRANCE
• Definitions suitable for CIV–CORE citation
• No learning chronology
• No beliefs
• No rejected or provisional artifacts

This file:
• Does NOT learn
• Does NOT synthesize
• Does NOT evolve autonomously

Authority Flow:
CIV–MEM–CORE → CIV–CORE–FRANCIA → DIB–FRANCIA → CIV–DOCTRINE–FRANCE

Only doctrines listed here may be treated as **authoritative** for
the French state.

II. DOCTRINE REGISTRY (AUTHORITATIVE)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

DOCTRINE 01
Name: DECLARATIVE LEGITIMACY
Status: ACCEPTED · LOCKED · CANONICAL
Source: CIV–SCHOLAR–FRANCE (SYNTHESIS 0001)

Definition:
Francia generates authority through articulated universal claims,
law, symbolism, and moral framing rather than procedural endurance
or administrative patience.

Operational Meaning:
• Legitimacy is asserted before it is enforced
• Law and rhetoric precede capacity
• Authority flows from declaration, not survival

Hard Constraints:
• Declarative legitimacy collapses if enforcement lags symbolism
• Moral claims without capacity accelerate loss of authority
• Narrative strength cannot substitute for material control

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

DOCTRINE 02
Name: UNIVERSALISM–CAPACITY DIVERGENCE
Status: ACCEPTED · LOCKED · CANONICAL
Source: CIV–SCHOLAR–FRANCE (SYNTHESIS 0002)

Definition:
When Francia's universal claims exceed its material, fiscal,
or military capacity, legitimacy decays faster than territory
or institutions.

Operational Meaning:
• Universalism creates escalation pressure
• Capacity shortfalls expose moral claims
• Decline is reputational before territorial
• Historical maximum territorial extent correlates with fragmentation or
  revolution risk; in the Francia corpus, the dynasties with greatest peak
  extent (Carolingian, Bourbon) ended in fragmentation or revolution; the
  dynasty remembered as consolidator (Capetian) ranked third by extent.
• The Napoleonic arc (1799–1815) is the canonical test: Continental System
  and Trafalgar encode universalism without maritime capacity; maximum
  continental extent preceded Leipzig defection and Waterloo.

Hard Constraints:
• Overextension produces elite fracture
• Capacity gaps convert victory into exhaustion
• Universal missions require disproportionate enforcement

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

DOCTRINE 03
Name: RUPTURE AS RENEWAL
Status: ACCEPTED · LOCKED · CANONICAL
Source: CIV–SCHOLAR–FRANCE (SYNTHESIS 0001 / 0003)

Definition:
Francia treats regime collapse, revolution, or systemic rupture
as legitimate corrective mechanisms for restoring moral coherence
and civilizational purpose.

Operational Meaning:
• Collapse is reframed as purification
• Defeat enables ideological reset
• Continuity is moral, not institutional

Hard Constraints:
• Repeated rupture degrades institutional memory
• Reset culture undermines long-term endurance
• Renewal without consolidation invites recurrence

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

DOCTRINE 04
Name: POST-HEGEMONIC STRATEGIC ANXIETY
Status: ACCEPTED · LOCKED · CANONICAL
Source: CIV–SCHOLAR–FRANCE (SYNTHESIS 0003)

Definition:
After hegemonic defeat, Francia internalizes loss as civilizational
memory, producing defensive strategy, alliance dependence, and
structural rigidity masked by universalist rhetoric.

Operational Meaning:
• Strategy becomes loss-avoidant
• Alliances substitute for sovereignty
• Past defeat governs present posture
• Napoleon/Themistocles encodes structural reversal: would-be hegemon
  becomes supplicant to balancer; post-hegemonic anxiety is partly memory
  of that reversal

Hard Constraints:
• Anxiety hardens doctrine
• Rigidity replaces adaptation
• Universal language persists without hegemonic capacity

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

DOCTRINE 05
Name: LEGITIMACY–CAPACITY OSCILLATOR
Status: ACCEPTED · LOCKED · CANONICAL
Source: CIV–SCHOLAR–FRANCE (SYNTHESIS 0006)

Definition:
Francia exhibits a recurrent oscillation between asserted legitimacy
and enforceable capacity, in which divergence is periodically resolved
through external war, defeat, or regime reset rather than gradual
institutional correction.

Operational Meaning:
• War is used as legitimacy correction
• Victory restores credibility; defeat enables reset
• The Revolution → Consulate → Empire → defeat sequence (1799–1815) is the
  canonical full oscillation; Leipzig and Waterloo as reset.
• Conflict frequency rises independently of necessity

Hard Constraints:
• Oscillation increases cumulative war exposure
• Externalization substitutes for internal reform
• Repeated cycles erode long-term strategic patience

IV. CITATION RULES
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
CIV–CORE–FRANCIA may reference doctrines from this file only.

Required citation format:
• Doctrine Name
• CIV–DOCTRINE–FRANCE version
• Doctrine number

Example:
"Per DOCTRINE 05 (LEGITIMACY–CAPACITY OSCILLATOR),
external conflict frequency increases as divergence widens."

Silent doctrine usage is prohibited.

V. VERSIONING & LOCK
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file is LOCKED.

• Additions require DIB–FRANCIA approval
• Modifications require version bump
• Deletions are forbidden

Supersedes:
• CIV–DOCTRINE–FRANCIA v1.1 (pre-rename)
• CIV–DOCTRINE–FRANCIA v1.0 (pre-rename)

v1.2: Typo correction — DOCTRINE 02 name "DIVERGENAD" → "DIVERGENCE".
v3.0: Rename CIV–DOCTRINE–FRANCIA → CIV–DOCTRINE–FRANCE (doctrine governs state action; civilizations are not unified actors).
v3.1: DOCTRINE 02 — additive operational meaning: historical maximum territorial extent correlates with fragmentation or revolution risk; Carolingian/Bourbon (largest by extent) ended in fragmentation/revolution; Capetian (third) remembered as consolidator. Derivation: dynasty extent ordering, RLL–FRANCIA–0016 (CANDIDATE).
v3.2: DOCTRINE 02 and 05 — additive operational meaning: Napoleonic arc (1799–1815) as canonical test (Continental System, Trafalgar, Leipzig, Waterloo; full oscillation). Derivation: ENTRY 0016, gated spiral session Napoleonic France.
v3.3: DOCTRINE 04 — additive operational meaning: Napoleon/Themistocles encodes structural reversal (would-be hegemon becomes supplicant to balancer); post-hegemonic anxiety partly memory of that reversal. Derivation: Second-pass Mearsheimer, BENEFIT–NAPOLEONIC–STRUCTURAL–READINGS–2026–02–11.
