I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves Poitiers as **Francia's demonstration that
learning nothing from Crécy produces worse catastrophe**: the battle
that captured the French king and nearly destroyed the kingdom.

For Francia, Poitiers is **humiliation magnified**—not merely defeat
but the capture of the sovereign. Ten years after Crécy, France
charged English archers again, with the same result but worse
consequences. The king's ransom bankrupted the kingdom; his
absence unleashed chaos.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. STRATEGIC CONTEXT: THE BLACK PRINCE'S RAID
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Edward, the Black Prince, raids from Aquitaine.

Campaign context:
• Black Prince raids from English Aquitaine
• Chevauchée through central France (1356)
• John II pursues with royal army
• Black Prince seeks escape, not battle
• John II forces engagement near Poitiers

The tactical situation:

"The Black Prince did not want to fight at Poitiers. His army was
laden with plunder, exhausted from marching, and outnumbered at
least two to one. He sought to negotiate passage back to Aquitaine.
John II refused; he saw an opportunity to avenge Crécy and destroy
the English field force. The Black Prince, cornered, did what his
father had done ten years before: chose defensive ground, deployed
his archers, and waited."
— Jonathan Sumption, *The Hundred Years War, Vol. II* (1999)

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. THE FRENCH APPROACH: CRÉCY LESSONS MISAPPLIED
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
John II attempts to counter longbow tactics.

French adaptations:
• Knights ordered to dismount and advance on foot
• Horses too vulnerable to arrows; men-at-arms walk
• Heavy armor to resist arrows at range
• Crossbowmen to provide covering fire

The problem:

"John II learned the wrong lesson from Crécy. He understood that
cavalry could not charge through arrow storms, so he ordered his
knights to fight on foot. But dismounted men-at-arms in sixty
pounds of armor, walking uphill through plowed fields, were
exhausted before they reached the English. The arrows still fell;
men still died at range. When survivors finally closed with the
English line, they were too tired to fight effectively. The
adaptation addressed symptoms, not causes."
— John Keegan, *A History of Warfare* (1993)

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. THE BATTLE: ARROW STORM REDUX
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Poitiers repeats Crécy with additional disasters.

The sequence:
• French advance in three divisions ("battles")
• First division advances on foot, suffers heavily from arrows
• Second division, seeing first's losses, retreats without fighting
• Third division under King John advances
• King John's division reaches English line but cannot break it
• English cavalry counterattack catches French exhausted
• King John captured fighting on foot

The critical moment:

"The second French battle, led by the Dauphin, retreated before
engaging. They had watched the first division walk into arrows
and die. Rather than reinforce disaster, they withdrew—abandoning
their king, who was advancing with the third division behind them.
When John II's battle finally reached the English, they had already
absorbed casualties from archery and were exhausted from the march.
The English counterattack broke them. John II, fighting on foot
with an axe, was surrounded and captured."
— Barbara Tuchman, *A Distant Mirror* (1978)

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. THE KING'S CAPTURE: SOVEREIGNTY LOST
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
John II's capture creates constitutional crisis.

The capture:
• John II fights until surrounded
• Surrenders to avoid death
• Taken to England as prisoner
• Held for four years (1356-1360)
• Dies in captivity (1364) after returning voluntarily

The ransom:

"The ransom demanded for John II was three million gold écus—
roughly twice France's annual royal revenue. The kingdom, already
impoverished by war and plague, could not pay. The Treaty of
Brétigny (1360) required the ransom plus cession of Aquitaine,
Calais, and other territories in full sovereignty. France lost
a third of its territory to free its king. When John II returned
to England in 1364—voluntarily, because hostages left as surety
had escaped—he died there. His honor exceeded his kingdom's capacity."
— Jonathan Sumption, *The Hundred Years War, Vol. II* (1999)

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. THE TREATY OF BRÉTIGNY: TERRITORIAL DISMEMBERMENT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
France pays catastrophic price.

Treaty terms (1360):
• Ransom: 3 million écus
• Aquitaine ceded in full sovereignty
• Calais and Ponthieu ceded
• English renounce claim to French throne
• France renounces suzerainty over ceded lands

The territorial loss:

"The Treaty of Brétigny represented France's lowest point in the
Hundred Years' War. A third of the kingdom passed to English
sovereignty. Aquitaine, which had been held under French suzerainty
since 1259, became English outright. The principle that had
sustained French claims—that the English king held Aquitaine as
a vassal of France—was abandoned. France was not merely defeated;
it was dismembered."
— John Keegan, *A History of Warfare* (1993)

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. DOMESTIC CONSEQUENCES: JACQUERIE AND CHAOS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The king's absence unleashes social collapse.

Consequences:
• Estates-General attempts to govern (1357)
• Étienne Marcel leads Parisian uprising
• Dauphin Charles (future Charles V) struggles for control
• Jacquerie (peasant revolt) erupts (1358)
• Free Companies (unemployed mercenaries) ravage countryside

The breakdown:

"John II's captivity created a power vacuum that France nearly did
not survive. The Estates-General, led by Étienne Marcel, attempted
to impose constitutional constraints on the monarchy. When that
failed, Paris revolted. Simultaneously, peasants in the Île-de-France
rose in the Jacquerie, slaughtering nobles. The Dauphin suppressed
both, but France's central authority was shattered. Mercenary
companies, unpaid and uncontrolled, became the kingdom's real
rulers in many regions."
— Barbara Tuchman, *A Distant Mirror* (1978)

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VIII. CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Poitiers encodes **catastrophe from refusal to adapt**.

For Francia, Poitiers demonstrates:
• Crécy's lessons were not learned
• Tactical modification without strategic understanding fails
• The king's person can be lost to military incompetence
• Defeat produces social collapse, not merely military setback

The memory compounds:
• Crécy (1346): disaster
• Poitiers (1356): catastrophe
• Sixty more years of failure before Agincourt (1415)

AXIOM FRANCIA-002 (Universalism-Capacity Divergence) intensifies:
France's self-image as military exemplar prevents genuine adaptation.
John II's honor—fighting to capture rather than retreating—embodies
the disconnect between chivalric ideal and tactical reality.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IX. JOHN II "THE GOOD": HONOR WITHOUT WISDOM
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
John II's epithet reveals medieval values.

"The Good" means:
• Brave in battle
• Loyal to chivalric code
• Generous to followers
• It does NOT mean "competent"

The assessment:

"John II was called 'the Good' because he embodied chivalric virtues:
courage, generosity, fidelity. He fought at Poitiers when he could
have fled; he returned to English captivity when his hostages escaped.
His honor was impeccable. His judgment was catastrophic. He forced
battle when he should have maneuvered; he advanced when he should
have retreated; he returned to captivity when France needed its king.
Medieval 'goodness' had nothing to do with political competence."
— Barbara Tuchman, *A Distant Mirror* (1978)

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
X. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Poitiers repeated Crécy with the king's capture added.
• Dismounting knights addressed symptoms, not causes.
• The Dauphin's division retreating mid-battle was rational but dishonorable.
• King John's ransom was twice annual royal revenue.
• Treaty of Brétigny ceded a third of France.
• Domestic collapse (Jacquerie, Marcel, Free Companies) followed.
• John II returned to captivity voluntarily—honor over kingdom.
• "The Good" meant brave, not wise.
• Same tactical system defeated France at 10-year intervals.
• France would not learn until Joan of Arc.

Contradictions preserved without verdict.
