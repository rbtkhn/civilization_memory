I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves Reims as **Francia's coronation city**: the place
where French kings were anointed and crowned, where Clovis was baptized
(tradition), and where Charles VII's coronation (July 1429) re-anchored
Valois legitimacy during the Hundred Years' War.

For Francia, Reims encodes **legitimacy through ritual geography**—the
city that could not be bypassed if kingship was to be legitimate, and
whose capture by the Dauphin's party (with Joan of Arc) turned the
moral and symbolic balance of the war.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. CONTEXT: REIMS AND SACRAL KINGSHIP
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Reims becomes the fixed site of French royal coronation through the
fusion of Frankish baptismal tradition and Capetian consolidation.

Conditions:
• Tradition of Clovis's baptism at Reims (late 5th c.)—foundational
  narrative of Frankish-Christian kingship
• Archbishop of Reims as consecrator; cathedral as ritual stage
• Capetian adoption of Reims as sole coronation site (with few
  exceptions); anointing and crowning bind king to realm and God

Verbatim scholarship (ARC-T-MODERN):

"The Capetians consolidated a fragmented realm into the most powerful
monarchy of the Middle Ages, adopting the fleur-de-lys as the emblem of
divine favor and royal continuity. They did not conquer by explosion but
by patience—outlasting rivals, absorbing fiefs, and **fusing anointing
with hereditary succession** so that the king embodied the state."
— Justine Firnhaber-Baker, *House of Lilies: The Dynasty That Made
Medieval France* (London: Allen Lane, 2024) (ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-SECONDARY]

Reims is where that fusion is performed: the city where anointing and
hereditary claim are ritually united. To be uncrowned at Reims is to
lack the sacral stamp; to be crowned there is to enter the legitimacy
grammar of Francia.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. HUNDRED YEARS' WAR: REIMS AS CONTESTED PRIZE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
After the Treaty of Troyes (1420), the Dauphin Charles holds the south
but has not been crowned. Reims lies in contested or Anglo-Burgundian
space; to reach it, the Dauphin must break through militarily and
symbolically.

Dynamics:
• Relief of Orléans (May 1429) opens the route; Joan insists on Reims
• July 1429: Charles VII crowned at Reims Cathedral—legitimacy re-anchored
• Coronation does not win the war but **re-moralizes** it; defection to
  Valois becomes thinkable; material recovery (1431–1453) follows

Reims thus encodes the **sequence Orléans → Reims → recovery**: the city
where legitimacy is ritually restored before administrative and
military consolidation. Without Reims, the Dauphin remains a claimant;
with Reims, he is the anointed king.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. CIVILIZATIONAL SIGNIFICANCE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
For Francia, Reims encodes:

• **Ritual geography of legitimacy**—kingship requires Reims; the city
  is the indispensable stage for anointing and coronation
• **Moral reversal before material recovery**—Charles VII's coronation
  (1429) precedes standing army, taille, and territorial reabsorption
  (1431–1453); belief and ritual lead, institutions follow
• **Contrast with Paris**—Paris is the administrative and symbolic
  capital; Reims is the **sacral** capital where the king becomes king.
  Loss of Paris (1420) is catastrophic; recovery of Reims (1429) is
  the precondition for legitimacy narrative

SYNTHESIS 0004 medieval extension and RLL–FRANCIA–0011: Reims is the
**site** where "moral reversal preceding material recovery" is
ritually performed—the coronation that makes Valois recovery legible
as restoration rather than mere conquest.
