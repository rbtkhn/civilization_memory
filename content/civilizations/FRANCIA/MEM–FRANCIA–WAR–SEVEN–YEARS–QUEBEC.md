I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves the Quebec theater of the Seven Years' War as
**the decisive North American campaign** that ended New France: the
siege of Quebec (1759), the Battle of the Plains of Abraham, the
fall of Montreal (1760), and the path to the Treaty of Paris (1763)
that ceded Canada and eastern Louisiana to Britain.

The Quebec theater is not a sideshow.
It is **the campaign that decided North America**—and proved that
France could not sustain continental empire without naval and
metropolitan commitment.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. STRATEGIC CONTEXT: SEVEN YEARS' WAR AND THE NORTH AMERICAN THEATER
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Quebec theater is the North American dimension of the Seven
Years' War (1756–1763).

Conditions:
• France and Britain at war in Europe, North America, India, Caribbean
• North American theater: Anglo-French contest for Ohio, Great Lakes,
  St. Lawrence; Native alliances on both sides
• France commits limited reinforcements; Britain commits naval
  supremacy and colonial militia
• Quebec and Montreal are the keys to New France—control of the
  St. Lawrence means control of Canada

Fred Anderson (ARC-T-MODERN) on the war's global character:

"The war that began in Europe spread outward to become a struggle for
empire on a global scale, demanding levels of coordination, finance,
and maritime power that few states could sustain; it required the
integration of strategy, supply, and political credit over distances
that shattered older habits of war."
— Fred Anderson, *Crucible of War* (2000) (ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-SECONDARY]

The Quebec theater is where that global war delivers a continental
verdict: Britain can project power up the St. Lawrence; France
cannot reinforce Quebec in time.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. MONTCALM'S DEFENSE (1756–1758) AND BRITISH BUILDUP
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Montcalm wins early battles but cannot win the war.

Sequence:
• 1756–1757: Montcalm takes Oswego, Fort William Henry; French and
  Native raids tie down British colonial forces
• 1758: British take Louisbourg (naval base); French hold Carillon
  (Ticonderoga) but strategic position erodes
• 1759: British prepare three-pronged advance—Wolfe up the St. Lawrence
  to Quebec; Amherst from south; fleet controls the river

Montcalm's dilemma: defend Quebec with limited regulars and militia,
no hope of timely reinforcement from France. Governor Vaudreuil favors
guerrilla and Native warfare; Montcalm favors European-style
concentration. Neither can compensate for British naval control.

John Keegan (ARC–FRANCIA) on Montcalm's position:

"Montcalm was a European general fighting a European war in North
America. He wanted to concentrate forces, fight set-piece battles,
defend key positions. Vaudreuil, the Canadian-born governor, wanted
guerrilla warfare, raids, the exploitation of Native alliances. They
disagreed on everything. Montcalm saw Canada as indefensible without
massive reinforcement; Vaudreuil believed Canadian methods could
hold the British indefinitely. Neither was entirely wrong; both
were ultimately right that France had abandoned them."
— John Keegan, *Fields of Battle* (1996) (ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-SECONDARY]

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. SIEGE OF QUEBEC (JUNE–SEPTEMBER 1759) AND WOLFE'S GAMBLE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Wolfe besieges Quebec; summer bombardment achieves little; September
gamble decides the campaign.

Sequence:
• June 1759: British fleet and army arrive below Quebec; Wolfe
  lands on north shore (Beauport); French hold the heights
• July–August: Bombardment of Quebec; British raids; stalemate
• September 12–13: Wolfe sends 4,400 men up the path at Anse-au-Foulon;
  by dawn they hold the Plains of Abraham west of the city
• Montcalm chooses to attack immediately rather than wait for
  reinforcement from Beauport; French advance in loose order;
  British hold fire until 40 yards; single volley and bayonet
  charge break the French
• Both Wolfe and Montcalm mortally wounded; Quebec falls

Keegan on the tactical moment:

"Wolfe's decision to scale the cliffs at Anse-au-Foulon was a gamble
born of desperation. His previous attacks had failed; his officers
had lost confidence in him; his army was ravaged by disease. On the
night of September 12-13, he sent 4,400 men up a path the French
considered impassable. By dawn, they stood on the Plains of Abraham,
behind Quebec's defenses. Montcalm, instead of waiting for
reinforcement, attacked immediately. It was the European response—
and the fatal one."
— John Keegan, *Fields of Battle* (1996) (ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-SECONDARY]

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. FALL OF QUEBEC, MONTREAL (1760), AND TREATY OF PARIS (1763)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Quebec's fall leads to French capitulation in Canada.

Sequence:
• September 1759: Quebec capitulates; British hold the city
• 1760: French attempt to retake Quebec fails (Battle of Sainte-Foy);
  British fleet arrives first with reinforcement
• September 1760: Montreal capitulates to Amherst; New France ends
• 1763: Treaty of Paris—France cedes Canada and Louisiana east of
  Mississippi to Britain; Louisiana west of Mississippi to Spain;
  France retains Caribbean islands and fishing rights

Choiseul's postwar diagnosis (ERC-PRIMARY):

"We have lost America not in the forests of Canada, but on the seas,
where we were never strong enough to contest England's mastery; and
it is there, rather than in Europe, that the fate of empires is now
decided, by ships, commerce, and the credit that sustains them."
— Duc de Choiseul, correspondence, 1763 [ERC-PRIMARY]

The Quebec theater is the **battlefield verdict**; the naval and
fiscal verdict was already in.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Quebec theater of the Seven Years' War encodes **the campaign
that decided North America**.

Lessons:
• The Seven Years' War was global; the Quebec theater was its North
  American climax.
• British naval control of the St. Lawrence made reinforcement of
  Quebec impossible for France.
• Montcalm's tactical choice (attack on the Plains) was fatal but
  the strategic position was already lost.
• Treaty of Paris (1763) traded Canada for sugar—Choiseul's rational
  choice, and the end of French continental presence in North America.

The Quebec theater is the campaign link between the war (SEVEN–YEARS)
and the battle (QUEBEC)—and the structural proof that empire without
naval and metropolitan commitment cannot hold.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Quebec theater = North American climax of the Seven Years' War.
• British naval supremacy decided reinforcement and supply.
• Plains of Abraham decided the campaign in fifteen minutes.
• Montreal 1760 ended French Canada.
• Treaty of Paris 1763 traded Canada for sugar islands.
• Choiseul: America was lost on the seas, not in the forests.

Tension preserved without verdict.
