I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves the French Colonial Empire as **Francia's
demonstration that universalist mission and imperial extraction
cannot be reconciled**: the enterprise that claimed to spread
civilization while practicing domination, and that required naval
power France could never sustain.

For Francia, the Empire encodes **the contradictions of republican
imperialism**—the belief that French culture was universal and
liberating, deployed to justify conquest and exploitation.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. FIRST COLONIAL EMPIRE: NEW FRANCE (1534-1763)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The first empire is built on fur, fish, and faith.

Characteristics:
• Population sparse (~70,000 Europeans by 1760)
• Economy: fur trade, fishing
• Alliance with Native peoples central
• Catholic missionary dimension
• Vast territory, minimal settlement

The structural weakness:

"New France was always an empire of rivers and alliances rather
than settlers and farms. The French colonists numbered perhaps
70,000 against over a million British colonists to the south.
The economy depended on the fur trade, which required Native
partners and vast wilderness, not agricultural development.
When war came, France lacked the population to defend its claims
and the navy to reinforce them."
— John Keegan, *Fields of Battle* (1996)

The Treaty of Paris (1763) ends the first empire:
• Canada ceded to Britain
• Louisiana east of Mississippi to Britain
• Louisiana west of Mississippi to Spain
• Only Caribbean islands retained

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. THE CARIBBEAN EXCEPTION: SUGAR AND SLAVERY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Caribbean colonies survive because they are profitable.

The sugar islands:
• Saint-Domingue (Haiti): richest colony in the world
• Martinique, Guadeloupe: sugar, coffee, cotton
• Economy entirely based on slave labor
• More valuable to France than Canada

"When Choiseul negotiated the Treaty of Paris, he chose to keep
the sugar islands rather than Canada. By the economics of the
time, this was rational. Saint-Domingue alone produced more
revenue than all of New France. Sugar was Europe's most valuable
commodity; beaver pelts were not. The decision revealed imperial
priorities: profit over territory, Caribbean over continent."
— Robert Tombs, *France 1814-1914* (1996)

The Haitian Revolution (1791-1804) destroys this:
• Largest slave revolt in history
• French army destroyed by disease and resistance
• Saint-Domingue becomes Haiti (1804)
• Napoleon sells Louisiana (1803)—empire's American remnant

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. SECOND COLONIAL EMPIRE: AFRICA AND ASIA (1830-1962)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
France builds a new empire after losing the first.

The conquest of Algeria (1830):
• Begins as punitive expedition
• Becomes settlement colony
• Eventually "integral part of France" (legally)
• One million European settlers by 1954

Expansion under Third Republic:
• Tunisia (1881)
• Indochina (1862-1893): Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos
• West Africa (1880s-1900s): vast territorial claims
• Madagascar (1896)
• Morocco (1912)

The scale:

"By 1920, France ruled the second-largest colonial empire in the
world. From Dakar to Saigon, from Algiers to Brazzaville, French
administrators, soldiers, and missionaries governed 110 million
people. The empire was rationalized as mission civilisatrice—
the duty to spread French culture, language, and institutions
to peoples deemed less advanced. The reality was extraction,
forced labor, and systematic racial hierarchy."
— Robert Aldrich, *Greater France* (1996)

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. MISSION CIVILISATRICE: IDEOLOGY AND CONTRADICTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
France claims a universal civilizing mission.

The ideology:
• French culture is universal, not particular
• Colonialism spreads Enlightenment values
• Subjects can become French through assimilation
• Unlike British "indirect rule," France offers citizenship

The reality:

"The mission civilisatrice was simultaneously sincere and
hypocritical. French republicans genuinely believed their culture
was universal—that education and assimilation could transform
'natives' into Frenchmen. They also maintained a colonial system
based on racial hierarchy, forced labor, and legal inequality.
The Code de l'Indigénat subjected colonial subjects to arbitrary
punishment without trial. Assimilation was promise; domination
was practice."
— Alice Conklin, *A Mission to Civilize* (1997)

AXIOM FRANCIA-002 (Universalism-Capacity Divergence) applies:
The claim to universal mission exceeds the capacity (and will)
to deliver genuine equality.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. THE WORLD WARS: EMPIRE AS RESOURCE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Both world wars reveal the empire's military dimension.

World War I:
• ~600,000 colonial troops serve
• Tirailleurs sénégalais, North African units
• Colonial labor in French factories
• Sacrifice used to justify continued colonialism

World War II:
• Free French forces based in Africa
• Brazzaville = Free French capital
• Colonial troops in liberation armies
• 1944 Sétif massacre prefigures Algeria

"The colonial contribution to both world wars was substantial.
Hundreds of thousands of African and Asian soldiers fought and
died for France. Their sacrifice was used to justify empire—
proof that the colonies were 'part of France.' But it also
generated expectations. Men who had fought for French liberty
returned home to colonial subjugation. The contradiction would
explode after 1945."
— Frederick Cooper, *Citizenship between Empire and Nation* (2014)

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. DECOLONIZATION: INDOCHINA (1946-1954)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The first major colonial war ends in defeat.

The sequence:
• 1945: Ho Chi Minh declares Vietnamese independence
• 1946-1954: First Indochina War
• 1954: Dien Bien Phu — French army destroyed
• Geneva Accords: France withdraws

Dien Bien Phu:

"Dien Bien Phu was the first time a European colonial power was
defeated decisively by Asian forces in pitched battle. The French
had established a fortified base in a valley, expecting to draw
the Viet Minh into conventional battle they would lose. Instead,
General Giap brought artillery through terrain the French thought
impassable and besieged the besiegers. After 57 days, 11,000
French troops surrendered. The empire's military mystique was
broken."
— Bernard Fall, *Hell in a Very Small Place* (1966)

Indochina's loss prefigures Algeria's trauma.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VIII. DECOLONIZATION: ALGERIA (1954-1962)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Algeria produces France's deepest colonial trauma.

Why Algeria was different:
• Legally "part of France," not colony
• One million European settlers (pieds-noirs)
• 130 years of colonization
• Algerian independence = amputation

The war:

"The Algerian War was France's most traumatic decolonization.
Unlike Indochina, Algeria was legally French territory; its loss
meant redrawing France itself. Unlike sub-Saharan Africa, Algeria
had a million settlers who considered themselves French. The
war lasted eight years, killed perhaps 300,000 Algerians, produced
systematic torture, and nearly destroyed the Fourth Republic.
De Gaulle ended it by accepting what seemed unthinkable: Algerian
independence."
— Alistair Horne, *A Savage War of Peace* (1977)

1962: Algeria independent
• One million pieds-noirs flee to France
• Harkis (Algerian loyalists) largely abandoned
• Trauma shapes French politics for decades

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IX. POST-COLONIAL: FRANÇAFRIQUE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Informal empire replaces formal colonialism.

Françafrique characteristics:
• Military bases retained in former colonies
• French troops intervene regularly (40+ times since 1960)
• CFA franc zone: monetary control
• Support for friendly (often authoritarian) regimes
• Economic relationships persist

The continuation:

"France did not abandon Africa when the flags came down. The
network known as Françafrique maintained French influence through
military agreements, monetary control, and personal relationships
between French and African leaders. French troops intervened
regularly to sustain friendly governments or evacuate French
citizens. Formal empire ended; informal influence persisted."
— François-Xavier Verschave, *La Françafrique* (1998)

The universalist mission becomes strategic interest.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
X. CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Empire encodes **universalism's colonial contradiction**.

For Francia, the Empire demonstrates:
• Universal mission claimed, racial hierarchy practiced
• Naval power required, naval power lacking
• Assimilation promised, domination delivered
• Colonial sacrifice exploited, colonial equality denied

The memory is contested:
• Some French remember mission civilisatrice positively
• Others acknowledge exploitation and violence
• 2005 law mandating teaching "positive role" of colonialism
  (repealed after controversy)
• Memory remains politically charged

DOCTRINE v0.4 (Post-Hegemonic Strategic Anxiety) includes colonial:
The loss of empire contributes to French anxiety about global
status, compensated by Francophonie and cultural diplomacy.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
XI. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• First Empire lost to naval inferiority (1763).
• Caribbean sugar was more valued than Canadian fur.
• Haitian Revolution destroyed the profitable remnant.
• Second Empire built on Algeria, expanded across Africa/Asia.
• Mission civilisatrice = universalism masking domination.
• Colonial troops fought world wars; expected equality afterward.
• Dien Bien Phu broke military mystique.
• Algeria was trauma—legally France, violently separated.
• Françafrique maintains informal influence post-independence.
• Colonial memory remains contested and politically charged.

Contradictions preserved without verdict.
