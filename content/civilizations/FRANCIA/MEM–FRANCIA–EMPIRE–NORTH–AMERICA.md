I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves French North America (New France) as **the First
Empire's continental dimension**: Canada and Louisiana—the vast
territory built on fur, fish, faith, and Native alliances, whose
sparse settlement and dependence on maritime reinforcement made it
vulnerable, and whose loss in 1763 (Canada, Louisiana east of
Mississippi) and 1803 (Louisiana sale) ended Francia's New World
continental presence.

New France was not periphery by choice.
It was **empire of rivers and alliances**—and the place where
demographic and naval weakness met British pressure and Choiseul's
rational choice: sugar over Canada.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

II. COLONIAL CONSTRUCTION: CARTIER TO CHAMPLAIN (1534–1608)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Francia enters North America in the 16th century; Quebec is founded
in 1608.

Sequence:
• 1534–1542: Cartier explores the St. Lawrence; claims Canada for
  France
• 1608: Champlain founds Quebec; New France becomes a going concern
• 17th century: Expansion along St. Lawrence, Great Lakes, Mississippi
  (La Salle 1682); fur trade and missionary presence
• Alliance with Native peoples central to trade and war (e.g.
  Huron, Algonquin; later conflict with Iroquois)

The model is not settlement but **trade and alliance**: few
colonists, vast claims, dependence on Indigenous partners and
wilderness. Population remains sparse—~70,000 Europeans by 1760
against over a million British colonists to the south.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. STRUCTURAL WEAKNESS: RIVERS AND ALLIANCES, NOT SETTLERS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
New France is an empire of reach, not density.

Characteristics:
• Economy: fur trade, fishing; little agricultural colonization
• Demography: sparse European population; no demographic parity with
  British colonies
• Governance: limited administrative penetration; reliance on
  Native alliances
• Military: dependence on sea lanes for reinforcement; inland
  depth meaningless without naval control

John Keegan (ARC–FRANCIA) on the structural limit:

"New France was always an empire of rivers and alliances rather than
settlers and farms. The French colonists numbered perhaps 70,000
against over a million British colonists to the south. The economy
depended on the fur trade, which required Native partners and vast
wilderness, not agricultural development. When war came, France
lacked the population to defend its claims and the navy to reinforce
them."
— John Keegan, *Fields of Battle* (1996) (ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-SECONDARY]

The weakness is structural: empire without circulation cannot endure
when the adversary controls the sea and outnumbers the colonists.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. SEVEN YEARS' WAR & TREATY OF PARIS (1763)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Seven Years' War (1756–1763) destroys New France.

Sequence:
• French and British (and Native) conflict in North America;
  Quebec falls 1759; Montreal 1760
• 1763: Treaty of Paris—Choiseul negotiates
• Canada ceded to Britain
• Louisiana east of Mississippi to Britain
• Louisiana west of Mississippi to Spain (to compensate Spanish
  loss of Florida)
• French Caribbean retained: Saint-Domingue, Martinique, Guadeloupe

Robert Tombs (ARC–FRANCIA) on imperial priorities:

"When Choiseul negotiated the Treaty of Paris, he chose to keep the
sugar islands rather than Canada. By the economics of the time, this
was rational. Saint-Domingue alone produced more revenue than all of
New France. Sugar was Europe's most valuable commodity; beaver pelts
were not. The decision revealed imperial priorities: profit over
territory, Caribbean over continent."
— Robert Tombs, *France 1814–1914* (1996) (ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-SECONDARY]

North America is thus **sacrificed** for Caribbean profit—rational
at the time, but it ends Francia's continental presence in the
New World.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. LOUISIANA: SPANISH INTERLUDE & FRENCH RETURN (1763–1800)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Louisiana west of the Mississippi passes to Spain in 1763; France
regains it in 1800 (Treaty of San Ildefonso).

Sequence:
• 1763–1800: Louisiana (Spanish): administratively separate from
  British Canada; New Orleans and lower Mississippi under Spanish
  control
• 1800: Napoleon secures retrocession of Louisiana from Spain—part
  of his American design (restore French presence, link to
  Saint-Domingue)
• 1801–1803: French attempt to reassert authority in Saint-Domingue
  fails (Haitian Revolution); Napoleon's American strategy collapses

Louisiana is recovered only to become surplus once the Caribbean
anchor is lost.

ARC–DISCOVERY: EXPANDED SEARCH
Source: W.J. Eccles, *France in America* (1972)
Justification: New France as empire of trade and alliance; no
ARC–FRANCIA listed author provides equivalent synthesis of colonial
structure.

"New France was not a settlement colony in the English sense. It was
a commercial and missionary enterprise sustained by the fur trade and
by alliances with Indigenous nations. The French population remained
small because the economy did not require large numbers of settlers—
it required wilderness, Native trappers, and access to European markets.
When Britain committed greater resources to North America and
controlled the sea, New France could not be reinforced or defended.
The colony was not lost because it was worthless; it was lost because
France could not sustain it."
— W.J. Eccles, *France in America* (1972) [ERC-SECONDARY]

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. LOUISIANA SALE (1803) & END OF CONTINENTAL EMPIRE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Napoleon sells Louisiana to the United States in 1803.

Sequence:
• 1803: Louisiana Purchase—France sells the entire Louisiana
  territory to the United States
• Rationale: Haitian defeat makes Louisiana indefensible and
  uneconomic; war with Britain imminent; cash needed
• Outcome: Francia's continental presence in North America ends
  definitively

The sale encodes the **double loss**: first Canada and eastern
Louisiana in 1763 (for sugar); then western Louisiana in 1803
(because sugar empire had collapsed). New France is gone; the
American remnant is sold.

Niall Ferguson (ARC–FRANCIA) on empire and naval-financial constraint:

"Empires require not only territory but the means to hold it—naval
power to control sea lanes, fiscal capacity to fund garrisons and
fleets, and the will to prioritize colonial defense over continental
ambition. France in the eighteenth century repeatedly chose
continental war over colonial investment. The result was that when
Britain applied naval and financial pressure, French overseas empire
collapsed—first in North America, then in the Caribbean. The sale of
Louisiana was the logical conclusion: without Saint-Domingue, the
American remnant had no strategic value, and Napoleon needed cash for
war in Europe."
— Niall Ferguson, *Empire* (2003) (ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-SECONDARY]

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. CONTRAST WITH CARIBBEAN: CONTINENT VS. SUGAR
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
French North America and French Caribbean encode opposite imperial
logics.

Contrasts:
• North America: vast territory, sparse settlement, fur trade,
  alliances—lost in 1763 (Canada, eastern Louisiana) and 1803
  (Louisiana sale)
• Caribbean: small islands, sugar, slaves, profit—retained in 1763;
  Saint-Domingue lost in 1804 (Haitian Revolution)
• 1763: Choiseul chooses Caribbean over continent; North America
  is the price
• 1803: Louisiana sale follows Haitian collapse; continental
  remnant has no strategic value without Caribbean anchor

North America is thus the **twice-lost** dimension of the First
Empire—first traded away for sugar, then sold when sugar empire
fell.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VIII. CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
French North America encodes **empire of reach without the means
to hold it**.

Lessons:
• Territorial extent (rivers, alliances) did not substitute for
  demographic and naval strength.
• Choiseul's choice (sugar over Canada) was economically rational
  but ended continental presence.
• Louisiana's recovery (1800) was brief; Haitian defeat made the
  sale (1803) inevitable.
• New France remains in memory as lost possibility—and as proof
  that empire without circulation cannot endure.

North America is Francia's First Empire continental mirror: vast
claim, sparse hold, rational abandonment, then sale.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IX. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• New France was empire of rivers and alliances, not settlers.
• 1763: Canada and eastern Louisiana lost; sugar retained.
• 1803: Louisiana sold after Haitian collapse.
• North America was twice lost—traded for sugar, then sold when
  sugar empire fell.
• Empire without demographic and naval strength cannot hold
  continental territory.
• New France remains lost possibility in French memory.

Tension preserved without verdict.
