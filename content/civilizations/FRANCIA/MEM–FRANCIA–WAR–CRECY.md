I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves Crécy as **Francia's first demonstration that
chivalric cavalry cannot overcome disciplined infantry with missile
weapons**: the battle that opened the Hundred Years' War disasters
and revealed the obsolescence of French military culture.

For Francia, Crécy is **the beginning of humiliation**—the first
of three catastrophic defeats (Crécy, Poitiers, Agincourt) that
would nearly destroy the kingdom. The flower of French chivalry
charged into arrow storms and died without closing with the enemy.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. STRATEGIC CONTEXT: EDWARD III'S CHEVAUCHÉE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Edward III raids northern France seeking battle.

Campaign context:
• English claim to French throne (1337)
• Edward lands in Normandy (July 1346)
• Chevauchée (raid) across northern France
• Philip VI pursues with feudal army
• Edward seeks defensive position to receive attack

John Keegan places Crécy in military evolution:

"Crécy belongs to a moment of transition in the history of warfare.
The armored knight, supreme on European battlefields for three
centuries, confronted a weapon system—the English longbow—that
could destroy him at range. The French refused to recognize this.
They charged as their ancestors had charged, trusting to armor
and élan. They died as their ancestors had not: at distance,
without closing, killed by yeomen they considered social inferiors."
— John Keegan, *A History of Warfare* (1993)

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. THE ENGLISH POSITION: DEFENSIVE EXCELLENCE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Edward III chooses his ground carefully.

The position:
• Ridge near Crécy-en-Ponthieu
• Flanks protected by terrain
• Longbowmen in V-formation ("harrows")
• Dismounted men-at-arms in center
• Wagons protect rear

The tactical system:

"Edward III's tactical system at Crécy was not improvised. It
combined elements the English had developed over decades: the
longbow's killing power, the dismounted man-at-arms as anchor,
the defensive position that forced the enemy to attack. The
archers were placed to create converging fields of fire. Any
cavalry charge would be struck from front and both flanks
simultaneously. The mathematics were simple: arrows faster
than horses, and more arrows than horses."
— John Keegan, *A History of Warfare* (1993)

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. THE FRENCH ATTACK: CHIVALRIC SUICIDE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Philip VI cannot prevent his nobles from charging.

The sequence:
• Genoese crossbowmen advance first (exhausted from march)
• English longbows outrange and outshoot crossbows
• Genoese retreat; French cavalry rides them down
• French cavalry charges uphill into arrow storm
• Multiple charges; all fail
• Fighting continues until nightfall

The disorder:

"The French army at Crécy was not an army in any modern sense. It
was a collection of noble retinues, each commanded by a great lord
who owed service to the king but took orders from no one. When the
Genoese crossbowmen faltered under English arrows, French knights
rode them down to get at the English—killing their own allies.
Subsequent charges were uncoordinated; each lord attacked when his
honor demanded, not when tactics required. The English killed them
in waves, like wheat before a scythe."
— Jonathan Sumption, *The Hundred Years War, Vol. I* (1990)

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. THE LONGBOW: TACTICAL REVOLUTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The English longbow dominates the battlefield.

Capabilities:
• Rate of fire: 10-12 arrows per minute
• Range: 250 yards effective
• 7,000 archers = ~70,000 arrows per minute
• Bodkin points penetrate mail at range; plate at close range
• Horses especially vulnerable

The effect on cavalry:

"The longbow was not merely a weapon; it was a system. It required
archers trained from childhood, a social class that provided them,
and tactics that used their capabilities. England had all three;
France had none. At Crécy, the arithmetic was pitiless: ten thousand
arrows per minute falling on cavalry that took several minutes to
close the distance. Horses fell, threw riders, panicked. Men in
armor, dismounted, struggled uphill through mud and corpses toward
an enemy they could not reach."
— John Keegan, *A History of Warfare* (1993)

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. THE BLIND KING: CHIVALRIC IDEAL'S DEATH
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
King John of Bohemia's death encapsulates chivalric tragedy.

John of Bohemia:
• Blind but insisted on fighting
• Retainers tied their horses to his
• Led into the English lines
• Killed with all his companions
• Edward III's son takes his crest ("Ich Dien")

The symbolism:

"John of Bohemia, blind and elderly, had no business on a battlefield.
But chivalric honor demanded presence. He ordered his knights to lead
him into combat; they tied their horses to his so he could charge
with them. All died together in the English lines. It was magnificent
and it was stupid. The Black Prince took John's crest—three feathers
with 'Ich Dien' (I serve)—as a trophy. Chivalry's self-image died
with the blind king."
— Barbara Tuchman, *A Distant Mirror* (1978)

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. CASUALTY ANALYSIS: ARISTOCRATIC DECAPITATION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
French losses concentrate in the nobility.

Dead nobles include:
• King John of Bohemia (ally)
• Duke of Lorraine
• Count of Flanders
• Count of Blois
• Count of Alençon (Philip's brother)
• 1,500+ knights and nobles

The class dimension:

"Crécy killed not merely soldiers but the military leadership of
France. The nobles who died at Crécy would have commanded French
armies for a generation. Their loss was not just tactical but
institutional. The survivors learned nothing; they would charge
again at Poitiers, and again at Agincourt. French military culture
could not adapt because adaptation required admitting that yeomen
with bows were more valuable than knights with swords."
— John Keegan, *A History of Warfare* (1993)

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VIII. CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Crécy encodes **technological transition refused**.

Medieval voice (ARC-T-MODERN):

"Fourteenth-century France was still a realm of noble retinues and
chivalric honor—not yet a state that could impose tactical discipline
on its aristocracy. Crécy exposed the gap: the English had developed
a system (longbow, position, coordination); the French had a culture
(charge, glory, individual valor). The Capetian-Valois monarchy had
consolidated legitimacy; it had not yet consolidated command."
— Justine Firnhaber-Baker, *House of Lilies: The Dynasty That Made
Medieval France* (London: Allen Lane, 2024) (ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-SECONDARY]

For Francia, Crécy reveals:
• Chivalric cavalry cannot overcome disciplined archery
• Social structure prevents military adaptation
• English yeomen defeat French nobility
• Individual valor is worthless against system

The failure to learn:
• Crécy (1346) → same tactics
• Poitiers (1356) → same tactics
• Agincourt (1415) → same tactics
• Seventy years of repeated failure

This rigidity demonstrates AXIOM FRANCIA-002 (Universalism-Capacity
Divergence): France's self-conception as military exemplar prevents
acknowledgment of tactical inferiority. The kingdom that leads
Christendom in war cannot learn from island barbarians.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IX. AFTERMATH: CALAIS AND CONTINUED WAR
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Crécy opens the path to Calais.

Consequences:
• Edward besieges Calais (September 1346 - August 1347)
• Calais falls; English hold it until 1558
• Black Death arrives (1348); war pauses
• Poitiers follows (1356); pattern repeats

The strategic effect:

"Crécy did not end the war; it defined it. England would fight
defensively, choosing ground, inviting French attacks, destroying
them with archery. France would attack because honor demanded it,
and because no French king could allow English armies to ravage
his kingdom unanswered. The pattern repeated until Joan of Arc
broke it—not by defeating English tactics but by restoring French
morale and forcing the English to attack."
— Jonathan Sumption, *The Hundred Years War, Vol. I* (1990)

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
X. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Longbow arithmetic: 70,000 arrows/minute vs. cavalry that takes
  minutes to close.
• French chivalric culture prevented tactical adaptation.
• English combined arms (archers + dismounted men-at-arms) dominated.
• Noble casualties decapitated French military leadership.
• King John of Bohemia's death symbolizes chivalry's obsolescence.
• Crécy → Poitiers → Agincourt: seventy years without learning.
• Social structure (yeoman archers impossible in France) constrained
  adaptation.
• Calais became English for 200 years.
• Defensive tactics won; French had to attack.
• Same battle fought three times; France lost all three.

Contradictions preserved without verdict.
