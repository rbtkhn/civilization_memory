I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves the Treaty of Frankfurt as **the instrument that
codified French defeat and territorial amputation** in 1871: the
cession of Alsace–Lorraine, the indemnity, and the conditions that
turned the Franco–Prussian War into a lasting legitimacy and
strategic wound for Francia.

For Francia, the treaty is not merely a diplomatic document. It is
**humiliation made contractual**—signed by a government that had
inherited defeat, under occupation, with no power to refuse the core
terms. Who signed, who bore obligation, and how the settlement
lasted until 1918 (and beyond in memory) are central to how both
Francia and Germania encode 1871.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

II. CONTEXT: DEFEAT AND OCCUPATION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The treaty was negotiated and signed after the fall of the Second
Empire, the siege of Paris, and the establishment of the Government
of National Defence and then the Third Republic. France had been
defeated in the field; Napoleon III was captured at Sedan; Paris
had capitulated after a prolonged siege. German armies occupied
parts of eastern France. The French government faced the choice
between continued resistance and a settlement that would end
occupation at the price of territory and money.

Adolphe Thiers led the French delegation. The German side was
represented by Bismarck and others. The terms had been largely
fixed by the preliminary peace of February 1871; Frankfurt
formalized them.

Henry Kissinger frames the structural reality:

"The Treaty of Frankfurt was not a negotiation between equals. France
had lost; Germany had won. The terms reflected that fact—territory,
indemnity, and symbolic submission. The French signed because the
alternative was continued occupation and possible dismemberment.
Legitimacy of the settlement was contested from the day it was signed."
— Henry Kissinger, *Diplomacy* (1994) (ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-SECONDARY]

III. TREATY STRUCTURED DATA (LAYER 2)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

PARTIES:
| Party        | Role    | Signature Date | Ratification Date |
|-------------|---------|-----------------|-------------------|
| French Republic (Thiers government) | Defeated | 10 May 1871 | 1871 (provisional assembly) |
| German Empire                    | Victor   | 10 May 1871 | 1871 (Reichstag) |

SETTLEMENT CLASSIFICATION:
| Field                 | Value |
|-----------------------|-------|
| CLOSURE_TYPE          | Path B (Rupture) — territorial transfer and indemnity imposed on defeated party; no inclusion of France in new order. |
| SETTLEMENT_TYPE       | Diktat (imposed peace) |
| ENFORCEMENT_MECHANISM | Occupation (phased withdrawal tied to indemnity payments) |
| DURATION              | 47 years (until Versailles 1919 superseded territorial provisions) |
| TERMINATED_BY         | Treaty of Versailles (1919); Alsace–Lorraine restored to France |

CLOSURE CAPACITY ALIGNMENT:
| Dimension  | Aligned? | Evidence |
|------------|----------|----------|
| Incentive  | No       | French revanche psychology and refusal to accept loss as final; German consolidation of gain. |
| Power      | Partial  | Terms reflected power balance in 1871; enforcement via occupation and indemnity. |
| Legitimacy | No       | Cession without plebiscite; French legitimacy narrative never accepted the transfer. |

TERRITORIAL PROVISIONS:
| Territory      | From   | To     | Status   |
|----------------|--------|--------|----------|
| Alsace–Lorraine (specified departments) | France | German Empire | Ceded (annexed) |
| Belfort        | —      | France | Retained by France (negotiated exception) |

Other: Indemnity of 5 billion francs; phased German withdrawal from occupation as payments made; commercial and legal provisions.

IV. TERMS AND OBLIGATIONS: WHO BEARS LIABILITY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The treaty imposed on France: (1) cession of Alsace and part of
Lorraine to the German Empire; (2) payment of an indemnity of five
billion francs; (3) acceptance of German occupation of eastern
departments until the indemnity was paid; (4) commercial and legal
clauses. The French state—the Third Republic, represented by Thiers
and his government—assumed these obligations. Successor governments
inherited them; the indemnity was paid ahead of schedule; occupation
ended in 1873. The territorial transfer lasted until 1918.

Liability is clear at the level of the state: the French Republic
signed and performed. At the level of persons and institutions:
Thiers and the negotiators acted in the name of the state; the
Assembly that ratified accepted the outcome. The question of
**legitimacy** of the cession—whether the French state had the
moral or constitutional right to cede Alsace–Lorraine—remained
open in French memory. So one can distinguish: **legal and
contractual liability** (French state bound by signature and
performance) from **legitimacy liability** (who is blamed for
accepting defeat and loss in civilizational narrative). The treaty
does not resolve the second; it enshrines the first.

Niall Ferguson on the indemnity and its political meaning:

"The five billion franc indemnity was not only a transfer of
resources; it was a symbol of submission. France paid it—and paid
it early—to get the occupiers out. The payment proved French
capacity to mobilize fiscally; it did not prove acceptance of the
territorial loss. Revanche was deferred, not abandoned."
— Niall Ferguson, *The Pity of War* (1998) (ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-SECONDARY]

V. CROSS-CIVILIZATIONAL ENCODING: FRANCIA VS GERMANIA
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The same treaty is encoded differently by the two civilizations.
For Francia, the Treaty of Frankfurt is **loss and humiliation**:
territory torn away, legitimacy wounded, revanche as latent doctrine.
For Germania, 1871 is **unification and victory**: the Rhine as
imperial frontier, Alsace–Lorraine as recovered German land, and
Bismarck’s settlement as the moment when Germany “knew when to stop”
(Fried). The treaty text is one; the memory is two. ENTRY 0017
(CIV–SCHOLAR–FRANCE) records this divergence: Francia has no
Path A (inclusion) from 1871—only wound; Germania encodes closure
and strategic restraint.

That divergence is structural, not merely cultural. The victor
records the settlement as order-building; the defeated records it
as imposition. Neither encoding is “false”; they reflect different
positions in the power distribution and different legitimacy
grammars.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. LEGITIMACY AND INSTITUTIONAL CONTINUITY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Third Republic was born in defeat. It inherited the obligation
to execute a treaty it had not designed. It seems reasonable to say
that the regime’s legitimacy was from the start burdened by the
memory of 1871: the Republic was the regime that had signed, that
had paid, that had lost Alsace–Lorraine. Recovery of the lost
provinces became a tacit condition of full legitimacy—achieved only
in 1918, and then contested again in 1940.

The treaty thus binds **institutional continuity** to **territorial
trauma**. The Republic endured; the wound endured. Neither the
payment of the indemnity nor the eventual recovery of the territory
in 1918 erased the memory of the treaty as the moment when France
was forced to sign away land and pay for defeat.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• The Treaty of Frankfurt codified defeat and territorial amputation;
  liability rests with the French state as signatory and performer.
• Legitimacy of the cession was never accepted in French civilizational
  memory; revanche remained latent until 1914.
• Cross-civilizational encoding splits on the same text: Francia =
  wound and imposition; Germania = victory and closure.
• The settlement was Path B (Rupture); it lasted until Versailles 1919
  superseded territorial provisions.
• Indemnity payment proved fiscal capacity and ended occupation; it
  did not resolve legitimacy deficit.

Tension preserved without verdict.

VIII. MEM CONNECTIONS (TYPED)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

DEPENDS_ON:
• MEM–FRANCIA–WAR–FRANCO–PRUSSIAN — Treaty ends the war; campaign outcome and defeat are prerequisite.
• MEM–FRANCIA–GEO–RHINE–RIVER — Rhine as wound and power boundary; treaty transfers left-bank territory to Germany.
• MEM–FRANCIA–GEO–MEUSE–RIVER — Sedan and invasion corridor led to defeat that made the treaty inevitable.

ENABLES:
• MEM–FRANCIA–ALSACE–LORRAINE — Treaty is the legal instrument of transfer; Alsace–Lorraine MEM records the territorial and symbolic wound.
• MEM–FRANCIA–WAR–FRANCO–PRUSSIAN — Treaty formalizes war outcome; both MEMs required for full picture of 1870–1871.

PARALLELS:
• MEM–GERMANIA–WAR–FRANCO–PRUSSIAN — Same war and treaty; Germania encodes victory and “knowing when to stop” (Fried).
• MEM–GERMANIA–BISMARCK — Bismarck as architect of settlement and German unification at French expense.

GEOGRAPHIC:
• MEM–FRANCIA–GEO–RHINE–RIVER — Treaty moves the Rhine from contested to German-held frontier; Alsace–Lorraine cession.
• MEM–FRANCIA–ALSACE–LORRAINE — Treaty is the mechanism of transfer; geography is the object.

TEMPORAL_BEFORE:
• MEM–FRANCIA–WAR–FRANCO–PRUSSIAN — Treaty follows war.
• MEM–FRANCIA–CONFEDERATION–RHINE — 1871 is the second act (frontier lost) after Confederation collapse (frontier re-established).

TEMPORAL_AFTER:
• MEM–FRANCIA–ALSACE–LORRAINE — Treaty creates the 1871–1918 status of the region.
• MEM–FRANCIA–WAR–FIRST–WORLD–VERDUN (and 1918) — Versailles supersedes Frankfurt territorially.
