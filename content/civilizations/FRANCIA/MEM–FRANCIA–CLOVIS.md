I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves Clovis I as **Francia's foundational moment of
ritual-conferred legitimacy**: the ruler whose baptism (traditionally
at Reims, by Bishop Remigius) established the template that one
ecclesiastical act in one place could convert Frankish kingship into
Christian–Frankish legitimacy.

For Francia, Clovis encodes **ritual confers legitimacy at origin**—
the first clear case in the corpus where a single ritual (baptism) at
a fixed site (Reims) is treated as the act that makes royal authority
legible and binding. Pepin's anointing (751), Charlemagne's coronation
(800), and Capetian/Valois coronation at Reims extend this same grammar.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. CONTEXT: POST-ROMAN GAUL AND FRANKISH RISE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Clovis inherits a landscape of Roman collapse and competing barbarian
kingdoms (Visigoths, Burgundians, Alemanni). Frankish power is one
among several; legitimacy is contested.

Structural conditions:
• Church retains moral and institutional reach across former Roman space
• Baptism as political signal: alignment with Catholic hierarchy (vs Arian rivals)
• Reims already an archiepiscopal see; Remigius (Saint Remi) as consecrator

Gregory of Tours (6th c.), in his *Historia Francorum*, records Clovis's
conversion and baptism: the king is instructed in the faith and baptized
by Remigius. Tradition fixes the site at Reims. The act fuses secular
authority with ecclesiastical sanction in a single ritual.

> "Then the king confessed his belief in God Almighty, three in one. He was baptized in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, and anointed with chrism with the sign of the cross. More than three thousand of his army were baptized with him."
> — Gregory of Tours, *Historia Francorum*, II.31 (ARC-T-MEDIEVAL) [ERC-PRIMARY]

The baptism is thus **one ritual, one place, one moment**: the ruler and
his following are made legible as Christian. Legitimacy is not inherited
from Rome alone; it is **conferred** by the Church at Reims.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. REIMS AS FIXED RITUAL SITE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Reims becomes the place where Frankish–Christian kingship is inaugurated.
Later coronations (Pepin, Charlemagne, Capetians, Valois) reuse the same
geography: the archbishop of Reims as consecrator, the site as mandatory
for legitimate royal inception.

Continuity insight:
• Clovis baptism (late 5th / early 6th c.) → Pepin anointing (751) →
  Charlemagne imperial coronation (800) → Capetian/Valois coronation
  at Reims. A single ritual chain: **one ritual in one place confers
  legitimacy**; the channel (Church) and the type of act (sacramental
  recognition of the ruler) persist.

The structural constraint is that legitimacy requires the ritual to be
performed at the designated site by the designated authority. Without
it, later Carolingian and Capetian claims to "legitimacy re-authored,
not destroyed" would lack a template.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. CIVILIZATIONAL FUNCTION: TEMPLATE FOR RUPTURE-AS-RENEWAL
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Clovis does not invent sacral kingship from nothing. He **receives** it
through ritual. The Merovingian dynasty that follows relies on the same
Church as "legitimacy stabilizer" (MEM–FRANCIA–DYNASTY–MEROVINGIAN).
When the Carolingians replace the Merovingians, papal sanction re-uses
the same grammar: dynasty replaced without rupture because legitimacy
is "re-authored" through the same sacral channel.

For AXIOM FRANCIA-003 (rupture enables renewal) and doctrine 03 (CIV–
DOCTRINE–FRANCE): the **deep precedent** for "renewal requires grammar
survival" is that the grammar itself—sacral sanction, ritual site—
is established here. Clovis is the first link in the chain that makes
later dynastic replacement (751, 1328) legible as continuity rather
than rupture.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• One ritual in one place can confer legitimacy on a ruler and dynasty.
• Reims becomes the fixed site for Frankish–French royal inception.
• Church mediation establishes the channel later used for dynastic transfer.
• Legitimacy is re-authored through the same channel, not invented anew.
• Clovis is the origin node for the ritual chain (baptism → anointing →
  coronation) that underpins Francia's rupture-as-renewal grammar.

Tension preserved without verdict.
