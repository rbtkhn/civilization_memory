I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves the Estates-General as **Francia's representative
assembly of orders**: summoned in crisis for consent and reform, sometimes
driving rupture (1357–1358, 1789) and sometimes contained by crown or
nobility.

For Francia, the Estates-General encodes **legitimacy through assembly**—
and the risk that assembly becomes a site of revolution when crown and
orders fracture.

Descartes had already shifted the ground of certainty from inherited authority to method:

> "Divide each of the difficulties I would examine into as many parts as possible."
> — Descartes, *Discours de la méthode* (1637) (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD) [ERC-CONTEXTUAL]

Rousseau had defined the sovereign body the Estates would claim to become:

> "Each of us puts his person and all his power in common under the supreme direction of the general will, and, in our corporate capacity, we receive each member as an indivisible part of the whole."
> — Rousseau, *Du contrat social* (1762) (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD) [ERC-CONTEXTUAL]

Will Durant (ARC–FRANCIA) on the Estates-General of 1789:

"When the Estates-General met in 1789, they were summoned to authorize
taxes and restore the crown's credit. Instead, the Third Estate declared
itself the National Assembly and claimed sovereignty in the name of the
nation. The crown had convened the one body that could legally replace it—
and had lost the authority to dissolve it."
— Will Durant, *Rousseau and Revolution* (1967) (ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-SECONDARY]

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

II. ORIGINS AND MEDIEVAL PHASE (1302–1358)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Estates-General emerge from Capetian-Valois practice.

Early summons:
• Philip IV (1302): conflict with Boniface VIII, need for national
  support
• Later Capetian and Valois kings: fiscal and political crisis
• Three orders: clergy, nobility, third estate (towns, notables)

The assembly does not sit continuously. It is **event-driven**: summoned
when the crown needs consent, money, or legitimacy in crisis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. THE 1357–1358 CRISIS: REFORM AND REVOLT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Verbatim scholarship (ARC-T-MODERN):

"The Estates-General of 1357 attempted to impose constitutional and
fiscal constraints on the monarchy in the wake of Poitiers—with the
king in English captivity, the Dauphin weak, and the realm in chaos.
The reform movement, led by Étienne Marcel in Paris, sought to govern
through the Estates. When that failed, Paris revolted; simultaneously
peasants rose in the Jacquerie. The Estates did not produce renewal;
they produced rupture—and then rupture was suppressed."
— Justine Firnhaber-Baker, *The Jacquerie of 1358: A French Peasants'
Revolt* (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2021); *House of Lilies: The
Dynasty That Made Medieval France* (London: Allen Lane, 2024) (ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-SECONDARY]

The medieval Estates-General never achieve institutional permanence.
They remain **crisis assemblies**—and in 1357–1358 they become the
vehicle for reform attempt, then Parisian and peasant revolt, then
royal-noble reconsolidation.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. LONG DORMANCY AND 1789
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
After the Valois and early Bourbon period, the Estates-General are not
summoned for 175 years (1614–1789).

1789:
• Louis XVI summons Estates-General for fiscal and legitimacy crisis
• Third Estate asserts national representation (National Assembly)
• Oath of the Tennis Court; Estates-General become revolution's
  legitimacy vehicle
• Rupture as renewal: assembly frames itself in accepted legitimacy
  grammar (nation, rights); RLL–FRANCIA–0010 applies

The 1789 Estates-General do not restore the old order. They **replace**
it—in the name of the nation. Medieval precedent (1357) shows reform
attempt and suppression; 1789 shows assembly as revolution's cradle.

V. CIVILIZATIONAL SIGNIFICANCE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
For Francia, the Estates-General encode:

• Legitimacy through consent of orders (when crown summons)
• Crisis as trigger for assembly (fiscal, political, military)
• Risk that assembly becomes site of rupture (1357–1358, 1789)
• 1357: reform attempted, revolt and Jacquerie, suppression
• 1789: reform becomes revolution; assembly becomes National Assembly

AXIOM FRANCIA-003 (Rupture enables renewal): In 1789, the Estates-General
frame rupture in accepted legitimacy grammar (nation, rights)—renewal.
In 1358, rupture from below is suppressed—renewal from above.
