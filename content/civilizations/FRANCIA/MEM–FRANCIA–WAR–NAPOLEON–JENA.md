I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves Jena-Auerstädt as **Francia's demonstration that
operational brilliance can annihilate a Great Power in a single day**:
the double battle that destroyed Prussian military power and established
Napoleonic hegemony over Central Europe.

For Francia, Jena represents **declarative authority made irresistible
through decisive operational success**.

For GERMANIA, Jena represents catastrophic education—the defeat that
produced the Prussian Reform Movement and eventual recovery. The same
event; opposite civilizational meanings.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. STRATEGIC CONTEXT: PRUSSIAN ISOLATION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Prussia enters the 1806 campaign strategically isolated.

Conditions:
• Austria defeated at Austerlitz (1805), not yet recovered
• Russia distant and slow to mobilize
• Britain limited to subsidies and maritime operations
• Prussia's neutrality policy exhausted

David G. Chandler frames the strategic situation:

"Prussia's decision to go to war in 1806 was taken in the worst possible
circumstances. Austria, humiliated at Austerlitz, was in no position to
assist. Russia, though nominally allied, was distant and distracted.
Frederick William III finally resolved on war only after Napoleon's
establishment of the Confederation of the Rhine made Prussian neutrality
untenable—but by then, Prussia faced Napoleon alone, with an army
organized on principles unchanged since Frederick the Great."
— David G. Chandler, *The Campaigns of Napoleon* (1966)

Prussia chooses war when alternatives are exhausted.

The choice appears irrational only in retrospect. In Prussian memory,
Frederick the Great's army remained invincible. In reality, that army
was ossified, its leadership aged, its doctrine frozen in 1763.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. INTELLIGENCE MASTERY: THE BATAILLON CARRÉ
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Jena demonstrates Napoleon's intelligence system at peak performance.

John Keegan's *Intelligence in War* contrasts Jena with Marengo:

Napoleon's reconnaissance system:
• Light cavalry screens advance in all directions
• Daily intelligence reports synthesized at headquarters
• Bataillon carré: army advances in square, can concentrate anywhere
• Enemy located before enemy locates French

"The 1806 campaign showed what Napoleon had learned since Marengo.
His cavalry screen extended fifty miles in every direction; no
Prussian movement escaped observation. The bataillon carré—the
army advancing in a square formation of corps—meant he could
concentrate overwhelming force at any point within 24 hours.
The Prussians, by contrast, moved blind. They did not know where
Napoleon was until his columns struck them."
— John Keegan, *Intelligence in War* (2003)

The asymmetry was total:
• Napoleon knew Prussian locations, strength, intentions
• Prussians did not know Napoleon's main axis
• Auerstädt occurred because Napoleon thought Davout faced a flank guard
• Even Napoleon's errors could not prevent victory

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. THE DOUBLE BATTLE: JENA AND AUERSTÄDT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
14 October 1806 produces two simultaneous battles with opposite
force ratios—both French victories.

At Jena:
• Napoleon commands directly
• French numerical superiority (1.8:1)
• Prussian force is secondary army under Hohenlohe
• French victory is expected and achieved

At Auerstädt:
• Davout commands III Corps alone
• French numerical inferiority (0.54:1)
• Prussian main army under Brunswick and the King
• French victory is unexpected and devastating

Andrew Roberts explains the Auerstädt achievement:

"Davout's victory at Auerstädt was one of the greatest feats of arms of
the entire revolutionary and Napoleonic period. With only 27,000 men
he defeated the main Prussian army of 50,000, killing or wounding the
Prussian commander-in-chief Brunswick in the process. Napoleon initially
refused to believe reports of the victory, assuming Davout had faced only
a detachment. When the truth emerged, it demonstrated that the French
system—decentralized corps capable of independent action—could triumph
even against numerical superiority."
— Andrew Roberts, *Napoleon: A Life* (2014)

The double victory reveals that Francia's operational system exceeds
individual genius. Davout was not Napoleon; he won anyway.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. PRUSSIAN COLLAPSE: CATASTROPHE BEYOND BATTLEFIELD
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The campaign's aftermath exceeds the battle damage.

Sequence:
• 14 October: Double battle, ~23,000 Prussian casualties
• 15-25 October: Pursuit; Prussian army disintegrates
• 27 October: Napoleon enters Berlin
• October-November: Fortress after fortress surrenders
• Campaign total: ~140,000 Prussian prisoners

The collapse is institutional, not merely military.

T.C.W. Blanning describes the psychological dimension:

"What was most striking about the Prussian collapse was its totality.
Fortress commandants surrendered without a shot; entire regiments laid
down their arms; the civic authorities of town after town capitulated
without resistance. It was as if the entire Prussian state had lost the
will to resist. The defeat at Jena-Auerstädt had shattered not just an
army but a system's confidence in itself."
— T.C.W. Blanning, *The French Revolutionary Wars* (1996)

For FRANCIA, this validates the extraction model: a single decisive
blow can eliminate a Great Power's capacity to resist.

For GERMANIA, this becomes the foundational trauma that produces
the Reform Movement—Stein, Hardenberg, Scharnhorst, Gneisenau.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. DECLARATIVE AUTHORITY AT MAXIMUM EXTENSION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Jena represents Francia's declarative legitimacy (AXIOM FRANCIA-001)
operating at peak effectiveness.

Napoleon does not merely defeat Prussia—he *unmakes* it:
• Occupation of all major cities
• Elimination of traditional officer corps
• Continental System imposed
• Prussian sovereignty reduced to dependence

The declaration becomes fact through military success.

Henry Kissinger analyzes the legitimacy dimension:

"After Jena, Napoleon's reorganization of Germany proceeded without
effective opposition. The Holy Roman Empire, abolished months earlier,
was replaced by French satellite states whose legitimacy derived entirely
from Napoleon's will. Prussia, reduced to a rump state, survived only
because Napoleon chose to preserve it as a buffer. Authority in Central
Europe now flowed from Paris, not from any traditional source."
— Henry Kissinger, *Diplomacy* (1994)

Declarative authority binds—but only while enforcement capacity holds.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. HIDDEN COSTS: EXTRACTION ACCELERATION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Jena's success accelerates the extraction system that will later fail.

Post-Jena extraction:
• Prussian war indemnity: 120 million francs
• Prussian territory: Westphalia created for Jérôme
• Prussian army: capped at 42,000 men
• Continental System: enforced compliance

The extraction appears costless to Francia in 1806.

But SYNTHESIS 0005 (Extraction Collapse) identifies the mechanism:
extraction costs become visible over time, legitimacy destinations
eventually appear, and defection cascades follow.

Prussia in 1806-1812 represents the **pre-visibility phase**:
• Extraction costs borne but not yet calculated against alternatives
• No legitimacy destination available (Austria weak, Russia distant)
• Reform Movement building capacity within constraints

By 1813, all three conditions for defection align.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. THE REFORM MECHANISM: GERMANIA'S RESPONSE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Jena produces opposite effects in victor and vanquished.

Francia concludes:
• Decisive battle wins
• Operational brilliance defeats institutional mass
• Declaration creates reality

Prussia concludes:
• The old system failed
• Reform is existential necessity
• The nation must be mobilized

Johannes Fried contextualizes the reform imperative:

"The catastrophe of 1806 shattered every assumption on which the
Frederician state had rested. The officer corps, the bureaucracy, the
social order—all were implicated in the defeat. What followed was the
most intensive program of state reform in German history: emancipation
of the serfs, municipal self-government, educational reform, and above
all, military reorganization. Prussia after Jena was not the same state
that had been defeated."
— Johannes Fried, *The Middle Ages* (2015), contextualized

The same event produces complacency in the victor and transformation
in the vanquished. This asymmetry structures the 1813 outcome.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VIII. CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Jena becomes **proof of system superiority**.

For Francia, it encodes:
• Decisive battle wins campaigns
• Operational brilliance defeats numbers
• Declaration backed by victory creates authority
• Great Powers can be eliminated quickly

But these lessons contain their own limits:
• Decisive battle wins only when the enemy accepts battle
• Brilliance requires functioning corps system
• Declaration fails when enforcement lapses
• Eliminated powers may reform and return

Jena validated AXIOM FRANCIA-001 (authority flows from declaration)
in the short term. In the long term, it demonstrated AXIOM FRANCIA-005's
limit: declarative authority binds only the destinationless.

Prussia after Jena had no destination—until 1812-1813, when Russia
provided one. Then the reforms enabled the reversal.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IX. CROSS-CIVILIZATIONAL DIVERGENCE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
FRANCIA encodes Jena as: validation of operational superiority.
GERMANIA encodes Jena as: catastrophic education requiring response.

The divergence is grammatically irreconcilable:
• Francia sees victory as confirmation
• Germania sees defeat as transformation catalyst

This divergence prefigures the Napoleonic Wars' ultimate outcome.
Francia's confidence is validated by each victory until the system
breaks; Germania's humiliation produces the reforms that enable 1813.

SDI implication: Same battle, opposite memory functions.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
X. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Decisive operational victory can annihilate a Great Power temporarily.
• Institutional collapse exceeds battlefield casualties in strategic effect.
• Corps system enables victory even at numerical disadvantage (Davout).
• Extraction follows victory; extraction costs accumulate invisibly.
• Defeat may produce reform; victory may produce complacency.
• Declarative authority reaches maximum extent at Jena, then faces limits.
• The reforms Jena produced in Prussia became the instruments of 1813.
• Francia's Jena lesson (decisive battle wins) is validated until it fails.
• Germania's Jena lesson (reform or perish) is validated at Leipzig.

Contradictions preserved without verdict.
