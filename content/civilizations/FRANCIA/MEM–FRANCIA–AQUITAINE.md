I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves Aquitaine as **Francia's medieval territorial
stake**: the duchy that passed from Capetian marriage to Plantagenet
hold and became the cause and theatre of the Hundred Years' War—ceded
in full sovereignty at Brétigny (1360), partially recovered by the
Valois, and finally reabsorbed by the French crown with the end of the
war (1453).

For Francia, Aquitaine encodes **legitimacy through suzerainty versus
sovereignty**—the French claim that the English king held the duchy as
vassal, and the rupture when that principle was abandoned at Brétigny.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. CONTEXT: THE DUCHY BEFORE ELEANOR
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Before the 12th century, Aquitaine was the largest and richest ducal
domain in western Francia—nominally under the king but in practice
autonomous.

Conditions (11th–early 12th c.):
• Dukes of Aquitaine rule from Poitiers; Occitan culture; weak royal
  control
• William X dies (1137); his daughter Eleanor is heir
• Capetian Louis VI marries her to his son (Louis VII) to bind Aquitaine
  to the crown

The marriage is **legitimacy through union**. The Capetians do not
conquer Aquitaine; they absorb it by inheritance and marriage—until
the annulment (1152) returns the duchy to Eleanor and then to the
Plantagenets.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. PLANTAGENET HOLD (1152–1259)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Eleanor's remarriage to Henry II (1152) makes Aquitaine part of the
Angevin empire—England, Normandy, Anjou, Aquitaine.

Dynamics:
• French crown retains formal suzerainty over Aquitaine (the English
  king holds it as duke and French vassal)
• Repeated conflicts over homage, jurisdiction, and confiscation
• Treaty of Paris (1259): Henry III does homage for Aquitaine; French
  suzerainty confirmed—but the duchy remains in English hands

The principle that **sustains French claims**—that the English king
holds Aquitaine as a vassal of France—is thus established. So is the
structural tension: the king of England is also duke of Aquitaine and
vassal of the king of France.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. HUNDRED YEARS' WAR AND BRÉTIGNY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The war turns on Aquitaine: English base, French objective.

Verbatim scholarship (ARC-T-MODERN):

"The Treaty of Brétigny represented France's lowest point in the
Hundred Years' War. A third of the kingdom passed to English
sovereignty. Aquitaine, which had been held under French suzerainty
since 1259, became English outright. The principle that had sustained
French claims—that the English king held Aquitaine as a vassal of
France—was abandoned. France was not merely defeated; it was
dismembered."
— John Keegan, *A History of Warfare* (London: Hutchinson, 1993)
(ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-SECONDARY]

Poitiers (1356) and the captivity of John II force the settlement.
Brétigny (1360) cedes Aquitaine in **full sovereignty**—no homage, no
suzerainty. The French crown renounces the principle that had framed
the conflict; the duchy becomes English territory in law.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. RECOVERY AND REABSORPTION (1369–1453)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Charles V reopens the war (1369); French recovery begins.

Dynamics:
• English hold on Aquitaine weakens; Black Prince's rule provokes
  rebellion
• French reconquest of much of the duchy over decades
• Final English defeat at Castillon (1453); Bordeaux falls; Aquitaine
  returns to French crown

Aquitaine is **reabsorbed**—not by marriage this time but by war and
administrative incorporation. The Valois restore the territorial
integrity that Eleanor's annulment had cost the Capetians.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. CIVILIZATIONAL SIGNIFICANCE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
For Francia, Aquitaine encodes:

• Territorial stake of Anglo-French conflict (cause and theatre of the
  Hundred Years' War)
• Legitimacy through suzerainty—and the rupture when suzerainty is
  abandoned (Brétigny)
• Duchy as object of dynastic marriage, war, and treaty—not yet "nation"
  but the prize over which crowns fight
• Recovery as reabsorption: Valois success in reclaiming the south
  completes the Capetian-Valois project of a kingdom from Channel to
  Pyrenees

AXIOM FRANCIA-003 (Rupture enables renewal): Brétigny **is** rupture—
Aquitaine lost in full sovereignty. Renewal is Charles V's war of
recovery and the eventual reabsorption of the duchy (1453). Aquitaine
thus frames both collapse and reconstitution.
