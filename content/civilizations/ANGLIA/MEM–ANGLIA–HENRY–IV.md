I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves Henry IV as **Anglia’s usurper-king**:
the ruler who seized the throne from Richard II (1399), ruled under
permanent legitimacy deficit, and bequeathed to his son (Henry V) the
need to “redeem” the line through war and discipline.

Henry IV does not invent rebellion.
He **embodies** the cost of deposition: the head that wears the crown
lies uneasy. Legitimacy must be earned or displayed—it cannot be
assumed.

This file does not moralize Henry’s seizure. It preserves *usurper
insecurity* as a structural condition: the king who took the crown by
parliamentary and baronial action must face continuous rebellion and
doubt, and the heir must refashion himself (Hal’s “redemption”) to
restore the line’s credibility.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

II. USURPATION & LEGITIMACY DEFICIT (PRIMARY + SECONDARY)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Henry of Bolingbroke deposes Richard II in 1399 and rules as Henry IV.
His claim rests on parliamentary acceptance and baronial support—not on
undisputed hereditary right. The result is **permanent legitimacy
deficit**: rebellion (Hotspur, Glyndŵr, the Percys) and the constant
fear that the crown can be lost as it was won.

Structural consequence: the Lancastrian dynasty carries a birth defect.
Henry V will later “redeem” it through martial success—Agincourt,
discipline, and French claims—but the father’s reign encodes the cost
of taking the crown by force.

Shakespeare encodes usurper insecurity: “Uneasy lies the head that
wears a crown” (*Henry IV Part 2*, 3.1). The line fixes the moment in
Anglian memory: the king who took the throne cannot rest.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. HAL’S SELF-FASHIONING & REDEMPTION (LITERARY)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Henry V’s emergence as “redeemed” heir is prefigured in Shakespeare’s
*Henry IV* plays: Hal’s “I know you all” (1.2) and his promise to “redeem
time” and “throw off” his loose behaviour. The father’s legitimacy
deficit creates the **need** for the son to refashion himself—through
war, discipline, and visible virtue.

The structural point is not moral. It is that usurper-kingship demands
a successor who can display legitimacy rather than inherit it
unchallenged. Henry V becomes that successor; Henry IV is the king who
made that display necessary.

SOURCE — *Henry IV Part 1*, 1.2 (Prince Hal) (literary) [ERC-SECONDARY]:
> I know you all, and will awhile uphold
> The unyoked humour of your idleness…
> I’ll so offend to make offence a skill,
> Redeeming time when men think least I will.
> — William Shakespeare, *Henry IV Part 1*, 1.2 (literary) [ERC-SECONDARY]

IV. CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Henry IV encodes **usurper insecurity** and **heir redemption**. The
king who took the crown by force cannot rest; the son must redeem the
line through war and discipline.

Lessons:
• Usurpation creates permanent legitimacy deficit.
• “Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown” encodes the cost of taking the throne by force.
• The heir’s “redemption” (Hal → Henry V) is the structural response to that deficit.
• Lancastrian legitimacy is repaired by Henry V, not by Henry IV.

Henry IV is Anglia’s usurper-king—the figure who made Henry V’s
martial legitimacy necessary.

V. MEM CONNECTIONS (STRUCTURAL)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Internal (ANGLIA):
1) MEM–ANGLIA–RICHARD–II
   — Deposition (1399); Henry IV’s accession creates legitimacy deficit.
2) MEM–ANGLIA–HENRY–V
   — Son’s “redemption” through war and discipline; Agincourt as legitimacy repair.
3) MEM–ANGLIA–DYNASTY–LANCASTER
   — Lancastrian legitimacy-fracture dynasty; Henry IV as founder.
4) MEM–ANGLIA–MAGNA–CARTA
   — Constraint precedent; deposition and parliamentary justification extend the logic of bounded kingship.
5) MEM–ANGLIA–ENGLAND
   — Usurper insecurity as civilizational theme; legitimacy must be displayed.

Cross-Civilizational (structural parallel):
6) MEM–ROME–AUGUSTUS
   — Succession after civil conflict; heir must consolidate legitimacy (contrast: Henry V by war, Augustus by settlement).

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Usurpation creates legitimacy deficit that cannot be solved by law alone.
• “Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown” encodes the cost of taking the throne by force.
• The heir’s redemption (Hal → Henry V) is the structural response.
• War becomes the solvent of doubt for the next generation.

Tension preserved without verdict.
