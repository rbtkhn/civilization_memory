I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves Edward I as **Anglia’s institutional consolidator**:
the king who developed Parliament as a permanent national institution,
curbed baronial and ecclesiastical autonomy, and fixed the “path
between despotism and anarchy” that England would make characteristically
its own—while extending royal authority into Wales and failing to
subdue Scotland.

Edward I does not invent Parliament.
He **regularizes** it.

This file records law-giving and estate-cooperation as civilizational
durability: the crown as national king, not merely feudal lord.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

Winston Churchill, in *A History of the English-Speaking Peoples*, Vol. 1 (*The Birth of Britain* [1956]), Ch. 18 (“King Edward I”), and in his earlier essay “The Great Reigns, Part 3: Edward I” (Evening Standard, 1937), identifies Edward I as “the greatest law-giver since Henry II, the greatest parliamentarian until Henry VIII.” Churchill frames Edward’s conception of the State as “based on the cooperation of the three Estates, the barons, the clergy and the Commons of England, on respect for their legal rights, and a firm suppression of mutual infringements.” “That path was found between despotism and anarchy which England has made characteristically her own. The prime impulse along this narrow but sure way she owes to Edward I” (ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-SECONDARY].

II. NATIONAL KINGSHIP & ESTATE COOPERATION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Edward transforms royal authority from feudal apex to **national** king.

Dynamics include:
• Direct knight-service demanded in war, irrespective of feudal obligations to immediate overlords
• Curbing of the Church and her courts
• Alliance with the merchant class; encouragement of trade
• Destruction of the absolute control of the barons over their tenants

The crown becomes the coordinator of estates, not merely the greatest lord.

Edward’s Model Parliament (1295) summons clergy, knights, and burgesses with the principle that what touches all should be approved by all:

> “As a most righteous law of the emperors ordains that what touches
> all should be approved by all, so it evidently appears that common
> dangers should be met by remedies agreed upon in common.”
> — Edward I, summons to Model Parliament, 1295 (Latin tradition)

Consent and representation are **procedural**, not democratic; they bind the crown to consultation while expanding who is consulted.

III. WALES & SCOTLAND: LIMITS OF PROJECTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Edward succeeds in Wales and fails in Scotland.

Wales:
• Statute of Rhuddlan (1284); English law and administration extended
• Principality absorbed; Welsh princes subdued
• Castles and towns as instruments of control

Scotland:
• Claim to overlordship; intervention in succession
• Resistance under William Wallace and later Robert the Bruce
• Edward I dies en route to yet another Scottish campaign (1307)
• Structural defeat at Bannockburn (1314) under Edward II confirms the limit

Edward I encodes **expansion of royal authority** and **limit of that expansion**: Scotland remains outside.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Edward I encodes **institutional kingship** and **path between despotism and anarchy**.

Lessons:
• Parliament can be regularized by the crown without being invented by it.
• Cooperation of the three estates becomes a durability technology.
• National kingship demands direct obligation to the crown, not only through lords.
• Expansion has limits; Scotland defines one of them.

Edward I is Anglia’s law-giver and parliamentarian king—and the king who could not hold Scotland.

VI. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Edward I regularizes Parliament and the cooperation of the three estates.
• The path between despotism and anarchy is institutional, not ideological.
• National kingship requires direct obligation and estate coordination.
• Wales is absorbed; Scotland is not—Bannockburn confirms the limit.

Tension preserved without verdict.
