I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves **Clive's role in establishing the British Empire
in India**: the moment when Company power crosses the threshold from
trader to territorial sovereign, and Anglia's imperial presence in
India becomes structurally irreversible.

Clive does not invent British India.
He **accelerates** it—within the Seven Years' War's global frame,
through political-military realignment (Plassey) and revenue capture
(diwani).

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. CONTEXT: COMPANY, WAR, AND EMPIRE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Clive operates at the intersection of three systems:

• **East India Company** — private capital, chartered authority, local armies
• **Seven Years' War** — global conflict; India as theater; Anglo-French rivalry
• **Anglian maritime-financial method** — naval backing, credit, coalition logic

The Company had traded in India for over a century. Clive's campaigns
(1740s–1760s) transform it into a **state-making institution**—
revenue, territory, diplomacy—without crown conquest narrative.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. PLASSEY AS POLITICAL-MILITARY REALIGNMENT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Plassey (23 June 1757) is not a classic field battle.

Characteristics:
• Small European and sepoy force; coalition with dissident elements of Nawab's court
• Defeat of Siraj ud-Daulah; installation of Mir Jafar
• Revenue (diwani) and territorial influence over Bengal secured
• Company as sovereign-like actor without formal crown annexation

Clive wins through **political alignment** as much as military force.
Local allies, bribery, and defection determine outcome more than
firepower alone.

The East India Company becomes a territorial power. Bengal's revenue
flows to Company and Crown. The British Empire in India acquires its
fiscal and administrative foundation.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. CHURCHILL & FERGUSON
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Winston Churchill, in *A History of the English-Speaking Peoples*, Vol. 3 (*The Age of Revolution*), treats the Seven Years' War as Britain's rise to world leadership—Clive's campaigns are the Indian dimension of that global war (ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-SECONDARY].

Niall Ferguson, in *Empire*, frames Plassey and the Company's ascendancy as the structural pivot—the moment when Britain's maritime-commercial system acquires a territorial revenue base in India that will fund imperial reach for a century (ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-SECONDARY].

SOURCE — Churchill, *The Age of Revolution* (Vol. 3) (ARC-T-MODERN):
> "The Dutch, fishing in the murky waters of Oriental intrigue, were stopped by Clive and made to surrender their ships at Chinsura."
> — Winston S. Churchill, *A History of the English-Speaking Peoples*, Vol. 3, *The Age of Revolution* (1956–1958), Seven Years' War section (ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-SECONDARY].

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. IMPERIAL METHOD: COMPANY OVER CROWN
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Clive encodes empire through **corporate and maritime** logic—not
royal project but Company one, later regulated by Parliament.

Mechanisms:
• Company armies and diplomacy
• Revenue extraction and trade
• Alliances with Indian powers; divide and stabilize
• Parliamentary scrutiny (Clive's later career; 1772–1774 inquiries)

Anglia's empire in India is initially **corporate**—a pattern that
defines British India until 1858, when Crown assumes direct control.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Company can function as state-making actor.
• Political alignment outperforms raw force in empire-building.
• Plassey is threshold event—trader to territorial power.
• Imperial expansion under Hanover is corporate before crown-led.
• Clive encodes the breakthrough; later actors consolidate.
