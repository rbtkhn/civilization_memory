I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves the House of Stuart as Anglia’s **sovereignty-crisis
dynasty**: a ruling house that exposed the incompatibility between
divine-right monarchy and an already-maturing constitutional system.

The Stuarts did not fail to rule.
They failed to **adapt sovereignty to institutional reality**.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. DYNASTIC ORIGIN & UNION OF CROWNS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Stuarts originated as the royal house of Scotland.

Key transition:
• James VI of Scotland becomes James I of England (1603)

Structural novelty:
→ One monarch, multiple kingdoms.

The union was **personal, not institutional**, embedding future fracture.

Jonathan Healey (*The Blazing World: A New History of Revolutionary England, 1603–1689* [2023]) frames the full Stuart period as genuinely revolutionary: not only civil war and regicide but far-reaching social and intellectual change, with new political ideas emerging from London’s coffeehouses and alehouses. Sovereignty crisis and institutional mismatch are central to his narrative (ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-SECONDARY].

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. SOVEREIGNTY DOCTRINE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Stuarts asserted divine-right monarchy.

Core beliefs:
• Royal authority precedes law
• Parliament exists by royal grace
• Resistance equals rebellion

Mismatch:
→ Doctrine lagged institutional reality.

England had already evolved beyond absolute sovereignty.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. PARLIAMENTARY CONFLICT & ESCALATION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Stuart governance generated escalating conflict.

Key drivers:
• Fiscal extraction without consent
• Religious uniformity enforcement
• Judicial manipulation
• Personal rule (1629–1640)

Outcome:
→ Parliamentary resistance hardened into structural opposition.

Negotiation gave way to confrontation.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. CIVIL WAR & REGICIDE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Conflict culminated in the English Civil Wars.

Key rupture:
• Execution of Charles I (1649)

Historical singularity:
→ A reigning monarch executed by his own polity.

This shattered sacral kingship permanently.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. INTERREGNUM & RESTORATION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The monarchy’s abolition proved unsustainable.

Key lessons:
• Military republicanism lacked legitimacy depth
• Governance without monarchy remained unstable

Restoration (1660):
• Charles II returns under constraint
• Sovereignty permanently reduced

Monarchy survived—but transformed.

Winston Churchill, in *A History of the English-Speaking Peoples*, Vol. 2 (*The New World* [1956]), Book VI (“The Restoration”), devotes chapters to “The English Republic,” “The Lord Protector,” “The Restoration,” “The Merry Monarch,” “Whig and Tory,” “The Catholic King,” and “The Revolution of 1688”—framing the Restoration and the Glorious Revolution as the period in which Parliament’s supremacy and constitutional monarchy are consolidated (ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-SECONDARY].

SOURCE — Churchill, *The New World* (Vol. 2), Preface (ARC-T-MODERN):
> "A great civil war was fought on abiding issues of principle. The country sustained a Republican experiment under the massive personality of Oliver Cromwell. But, at the nation's demand, the royal tradition was revived. At the end of this volume the Protestant faith has been secured under a Dutch monarch, Parliament is far advanced on the road to supremacy in the affairs of State."
> — Winston S. Churchill, *A History of the English-Speaking Peoples*, Vol. 2, *The New World* (1956), Preface (ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-SECONDARY]

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. GLORIOUS REVOLUTION & TERMINATION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Final rupture:
• James II deposed (1688)
• William and Mary installed

Outcome:
• Parliamentary supremacy formalized
• Protestant succession locked
• Monarchy subordinated to law

The Stuarts ended as **a solved constitutional problem**.

SUMMARY — Healey, *The Blazing World* (ARC-T-MODERN):
Healey treats the Stuart era as a genuinely revolutionary period in which sovereignty crisis and institutional mismatch drive rupture, and he frames 1688 as the closing settlement of that long revolutionary arc (non-verbatim summary).

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VIII. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Sovereignty doctrines that ignore institutions provoke rupture.
• Regicide permanently alters legitimacy grammar.
• Monarchy can survive only by self-limitation.
• Constitutional supremacy emerged through crisis, not design.
• Anglia’s modern system is built on Stuart failure.

Tension preserved without verdict.
