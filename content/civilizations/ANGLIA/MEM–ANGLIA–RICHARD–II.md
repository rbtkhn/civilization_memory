I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves Richard II as **Anglia’s deposition sovereign**:
the king whose removal (1399) established that legitimacy could be
transferred by parliamentary and noble action—not only by heredity or
battle—and who thereby became the template for “sad stories of the
death of kings.”

Richard II does not invent deposition.
He **suffers** it—and in suffering, encodes the moment when the realm
can unking a king.

This file does not moralize Richard’s reign. It preserves *deposition
as precedent*: the first successful removal of an anointed English king
by domestic actors, and the precondition for Lancastrian legitimacy
deficit and Henry V’s war-as-solvent.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

II. DEPOSITION AS PRECEDENT (PRIMARY + SECONDARY)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Richard II is forced to abdicate in 1399. Henry of Bolingbroke (Henry IV)
claims the throne with parliamentary and baronial backing. The act is
framed as resignation and acceptance, not conquest alone—legitimacy is
transferred by procedure as well as force.

Structural consequence: the new dynasty rests on **usurpation**, however
dressed in consent. Lancastrian rule will carry a permanent legitimacy
deficit until Henry V temporarily overwrites it with martial success.

Shakespeare encodes the transfer and its cost. Richard’s “sad stories of
the death of kings” and Gaunt’s “England… hath made a shameful conquest
of itself” fix the moment in Anglian memory: deposition is self-conquest
as well as regime change.

III. GAUNT’S ENGLAND: ISLAND IDENTITY & LAMENT (LITERARY)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
John of Gaunt’s dying speech in *Richard II* (2.1) supplies Anglia’s
durable image of England as “scepter’d isle” and “blessed plot”—a
fortress built by Nature, now “leased out” and degraded. The speech does
not describe Richard’s policy in legal detail; it encodes **civilizational
anxiety**: the realm conquers itself when authority fails.

That encoding outlasts the reign. Gaunt’s words become cognition glue:
shared recognition that legitimacy can be lost from within.

SOURCE — *Richard II*, 2.1 (John of Gaunt):
> This royal throne of kings, this scepter’d isle,
> This earth of majesty, this seat of Mars,
> This other Eden, demi-paradise,
> This fortress built by Nature for herself
> Against infection and the hand of war,
> … This blessed plot, this earth, this realm, this England.
> — William Shakespeare, *Richard II*, 2.1 (literary) [ERC-SECONDARY]

IV. CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Richard II encodes **deposition as transfer** and **self-conquest as
loss**. Legitimacy can be removed by domestic actors; the realm can
“make a shameful conquest of itself.”

Lessons:
• Anointed kings can be unkinged by procedure and coalition.
• Deposition creates lasting legitimacy anxiety for the successor.
• The “death of kings” becomes a repeatable story—tragic, not unique.
• Island identity (Gaunt’s “blessed plot”) persists even when the king falls.

Richard II is Anglia’s deposition sovereign—the figure who made
legitimacy transfer thinkable.

V. MEM CONNECTIONS (STRUCTURAL)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Internal (ANGLIA):
1) MEM–ANGLIA–DYNASTY–LANCASTER
   — Henry IV’s accession; Lancastrian legitimacy deficit originates in Richard’s deposition.
2) MEM–ANGLIA–HENRY–IV
   — Usurper-king; “uneasy lies the head that wears a crown” follows from deposition.
3) MEM–ANGLIA–HENRY–V
   — War-as-solvent for legitimacy deficit created by deposition.
4) MEM–ANGLIA–ENGLAND
   — Gaunt’s “scepter’d isle” / “blessed plot” also integrated in ENGLAND MEM.
5) MEM–ANGLIA–LAW–MAGNA–CARTA
   — Constraint precedent; deposition extends the logic that kings can be bounded.

Cross-Civilizational (structural parallel):
6) MEM–FRANCIA–LOUIS–XVI
   — Deposition and execution; different outcome, same theme of legitimacy removal by domestic actors.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Deposition is transfer, not only defeat.
• Self-conquest (realm conquering itself) encodes legitimacy failure.
• The “death of kings” is a repeatable story in Anglian memory.
• Gaunt’s England outlasts Richard—island identity survives the king.

Tension preserved without verdict.
