I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves Edmund Burke as **Anglia's philosophical immune
system**: the thinker who articulated why procedural continuity,
inherited institutions, and moral restraint outperform abstract
revolutionary reason in preserving civilization.

Burke is not anti-change.
He is anti-rupture.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. POSITION WITHIN ANGLIAN CIVILIZATION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Burke operates inside Anglia's parliamentary tradition.

Context:
• Member of Parliament
• Defender of constitutional balance
• Critic of arbitrary power (royal and popular)
• Participant in imperial governance debates

He speaks as an insider warning against self-destruction.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. TRADITION AS ACCUMULATED REASON
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Burke reframes tradition as intelligence.

Core claim:
• Institutions embody trial-and-error wisdom
• Customs encode solutions to forgotten problems
• Continuity preserves social knowledge

Reason is social before it is individual.

Abstract rationality is brittle without memory.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. REVOLUTION AS CIVILIZATIONAL AMNESIA
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Burke diagnoses revolutionary danger early.

Critique of the French Revolution:
• Destruction of inherited authority
• Moral absolutism replacing prudence
• Equality asserted without institutional mediation
• Speed prioritized over legitimacy

Revolution erases constraints faster than it builds replacements.

Winston Churchill, in *A History of the English-Speaking Peoples*, Vol. 3 (*The Age of Revolution* [1956–1958]), traces the French Revolution and its shadow over Europe and Britain's coalition response; Burke's critique of the French Revolution and Anglia's refusal to mirror revolutionary mobilization are part of the volume's narrative of Britain's rise through restraint (ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-SECONDARY].

SOURCE — Churchill, *The Age of Revolution* (Vol. 3) (ARC-T-MODERN):
> "In July 1765 the Marquis of Rockingham, a shy, well-meaning Whig who was disturbed at George’s conduct, undertook to form a Government, and brought with him as private secretary a young Irishman named Edmund Burke, already known in literary circles as a clever writer and a brilliant talker. He was much more. He was a great political thinker."
> — Winston S. Churchill, *A History of the English-Speaking Peoples*, Vol. 3, *The Age of Revolution* (1956–1958), p. 144 (ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-SECONDARY].

SOURCE — Russell, *A History of Western Philosophy* (ARC-T-MODERN):
> "Prudence versus passion is a conflict that runs through history. It is not a conflict in which we ought to side wholly with either party."
> — Bertrand Russell, *A History of Western Philosophy* (New York: Simon & Schuster, 1945), Book Three, Part II, Ch. XVIII "The Romantic Movement" (ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-SECONDARY]. Burke embodies the procedural/prudential pole against revolutionary passion.

SOURCE — Grayling, *The History of Philosophy* (ARC-T-MODERN):
> "Burke defended tradition and gradual reform against the abstract rationalism of the French Revolution; prudence and prescription over rupture."
> — A.C. Grayling, *The History of Philosophy* (London: Penguin Press, 2019), on Burke and the reaction to revolution (ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-SECONDARY]. CIV–ARC–ANGLIA v1.5.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. PROCEDURE OVER MORAL FERVOR
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Burke aligns with Anglia's procedural bias.

Principles:
• Reform must be incremental
• Legitimacy must precede power
• Authority requires consent shaped by habit
• Sudden purity destabilizes order

Moral clarity without procedure produces violence.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. EMPIRE, RESPONSIBILITY, AND LIMIT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Burke is not an imperial absolutist.

Positions:
• Defense of American colonial rights
• Critique of East India Company abuses
• Accountability of power as civilizational duty

Empire must be governed by law or it corrodes the center.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. BURKE VS. FRANCIA
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Burke functions as Anglia's anti-Jacobin.

Contrast:
• Anglia: inheritance, restraint, continuity
• Francia (Jacobin logic): abstraction, rupture, moral reset

Burke predicts terror not by hindsight, but by structure.

He sees legitimacy collapse before violence begins.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VIII. LONG-TERM CIVILIZATIONAL CONSEQUENCES
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Enduring effects:
• Conservative thought anchored to continuity
• Procedural skepticism toward moral revolutions
• Anglian suspicion of universalist resets
• Intellectual firewall against ideological extremism

Burke provides vocabulary for restraint.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IX. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Tradition is stored intelligence.
• Reform without memory is destruction.
• Procedure outlives moral certainty.
• Speed is the enemy of legitimacy.
• Burke explains why Anglia survives revolutions that destroy others.

Tension preserved without verdict.
