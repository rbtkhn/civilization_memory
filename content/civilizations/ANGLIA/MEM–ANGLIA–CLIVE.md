I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves Robert Clive as **Anglia’s imperial-system
breakthrough figure** in India: the Company soldier and administrator
whose victories (notably Plassey, 1757) during the Seven Years’ War
transformed the East India Company from trader to territorial power
and embedded British India within Anglia’s global maritime-financial
method.

Clive does not invent empire.
He **accelerates** it—within the same period in which Churchill’s
*The Age of Revolution* (Vol. 3) traces Britain’s rise through the
Seven Years’ War, coalition warfare, and global reach.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

II. SEVEN YEARS’ WAR & CHURCHILL VOL. 3
(PRIMARY + SECONDARY)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Winston Churchill, in *A History of the English-Speaking Peoples*, Vol. 3 (*The Age of Revolution* [1956–1958]), treats the Seven Years’ War as part of Britain’s rise to world leadership—the volume traces the Spanish and Austrian Successions, Utrecht, the Seven Years’ War (including colonial and Indian theaters), and the American and French revolutions (ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-SECONDARY].

SOURCE — Churchill, *The Age of Revolution* (Vol. 3) (ARC-T-MODERN):
> Churchill’s *The Age of Revolution* covers the Seven Years’ War and the rise of the American colonies within the volume’s arc from Marlborough to Waterloo—Britain’s emergence as world power through coalition warfare, finance, and global reach.
> — Winston S. Churchill, *A History of the English-Speaking Peoples*, Vol. 3, *The Age of Revolution* (1956–1958) (ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-SECONDARY]. Verbatim page refs to be added when source consulted.

Clive’s campaigns in India (notably Plassey, 1757; later Buxar and Company ascendancy) are the **Indian dimension** of that global war—maritime-financial power projected through Company arms and diplomacy.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. PLASSEY & COMPANY ASCENDANCY
(PRIMARY + SECONDARY)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Plassey (23 June 1757) is not a classic field battle so much as a
**political-military realignment**: Clive’s force, allied with
dissident elements of the Nawab’s court, defeats Siraj ud-Daulah and
installs Mir Jafar, securing Company revenue and territorial
influence in Bengal.

Characteristics:
• Small European and sepoy force; coalition with local actors
• Revenue (diwani) and territorial influence over Bengal
• Company as sovereign-like actor without crown conquest narrative

The East India Company becomes a **state-making institution** in
India—a pattern that will define British India until 1858.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. IMPERIAL METHOD: COMPANY OVER CROWN
(PRIMARY + SECONDARY)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Clive operates through the Company, not the crown.

Mechanisms:
• Company armies and diplomacy
• Revenue extraction and trade
• Alliances with Indian powers; divide and stabilize
• Parliamentary scrutiny and reform (Clive’s later career; 1772–1774 inquiries)

Anglia’s empire in India is initially **corporate and maritime**—not
a royal project but a Company one, later regulated and expanded by
the state. Clive encodes the moment when Company power crosses the
threshold into territorial control.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Clive encodes **imperial breakthrough through Company and coalition**.

He teaches:
• Global war (Seven Years’ War) has an Indian theater; Britain’s rise is multi-theater.
• Company can function as state-making actor—revenue, army, diplomacy.
• Plassey is political-military realignment, not merely battlefield victory.
• Imperial expansion under Hanover is often corporate and maritime before it is explicitly crown-led.
