I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves William III as **Anglia’s revolution-by-invitation
sovereign**: the ruler who arrives by parliamentary and elite consent
after the flight of James II, accepts the crown under the Declaration
of Right (1689), and consolidates the constitutional settlement that
enables the eighteenth-century method—Parliament, finance, coalition
warfare—encoded in Churchill’s *The Age of Revolution* (Vol. 3).

William does not conquer England.
He **accepts** it—and in accepting, secures the platform on which
Marlborough’s Blenheim and the Grand Alliance will be fought.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

II. REVOLUTION BY INVITATION & VOL. 3 BRIDGE
(PRIMARY + SECONDARY)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
William of Orange lands in England (November 1688) by invitation of
the political nation. James II flees; Parliament declares the throne
vacant and offers the crown to William and Mary (1689) subject to the
Declaration of Right, later the Bill of Rights. The settlement
establishes parliamentary consent as a precondition for legitimate
rule and limits the crown’s prerogative.

Winston Churchill’s *The Age of Revolution* (Vol. 3) opens with
Marlborough’s 1704 campaign at Blenheim fought **in support of
William of Orange’s legacy** and the Grand Alliance. William III thus
bridges Vol. 2 (*The New World*—Revolution of 1688) and Vol. 3 (*The
Age of Revolution*—Blenheim to Waterloo): the king who secured the
constitutional platform for coalition warfare and financial
endurance (ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-SECONDARY].

SOURCE — Churchill, *The New World* (Vol. 2), Preface (ARC-T-MODERN):
> "At the end of this volume the Protestant faith has been secured under a Dutch monarch, Parliament is far advanced on the road to supremacy in the affairs of State."
> — Winston S. Churchill, *A History of the English-Speaking Peoples*, Vol. 2, *The New World* (1956), Preface (ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-SECONDARY]

William’s reign (1689–1702) establishes the **fiscal-military state**
and the commitment to continental coalition that Marlborough will
execute under Queen Anne.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. CONSTITUTIONAL SETTLEMENT & BILL OF RIGHTS
(PRIMARY + SECONDARY)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
William and Mary accept the crown under constraint.

Key outcomes:
• Bill of Rights 1689 — limits on royal prerogative; Parliament’s role in law and taxation
• Toleration Act 1689 — Protestant dissent (within bounds)
• Parliamentary control of supply and army (Mutiny Act, annual renewal)
• No standing army without Parliament’s consent

Legitimacy is **conditional**: the king rules by consent and within
defined limits. This is the platform for long wars financed by
Parliament and fought in coalition.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. CONTINENTAL COMMITMENT & GRAND ALLIANCE
(PRIMARY + SECONDARY)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
William’s foreign policy commits England to containing French power.

Context:
• Nine Years’ War (1688–1697); War of the Spanish Succession (1701–1714) follows
• William builds and sustains the Grand Alliance; Marlborough will execute under Anne
• Bank of England (1694)—financial revolution enabled by parliamentary legitimacy

William does not live to see Blenheim (1704), but the alliance and
the fiscal-military structure are his legacy. Vol. 3’s opening
frame—Marlborough in support of William of Orange—encodes that
continuity.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
William III encodes **revolution by invitation** and **constitutional
platform for coalition warfare**.

He teaches:
• A king can arrive by invitation and consent, not conquest alone.
• Legitimacy can be conditional—Bill of Rights, parliamentary supply.
• The post-1688 settlement enables the fiscal-military state and Grand Alliance.
• Vol. 3 opens with Blenheim “in support of William of Orange”—William is the bridge from 1688 to the Age of Revolution.
