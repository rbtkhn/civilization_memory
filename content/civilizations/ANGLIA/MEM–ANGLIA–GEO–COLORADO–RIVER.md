I. GEO–MEM COGNITIVE DECLARATION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This GEO–MEM expresses MEARSHEIMER STRATEGIC COGNITION.

GEO–MEMs contain:
• Strategic analysis (~2/3): terrain logic, power distribution
• ARC verbatim quotes (~1/3): demonstrating permanent patterns

GEO–MEMs do NOT synthesize civilizational claims or polyphonic tension.
For full civilizational narrative, see subject MEMs (e.g. MEM–ANGLIA–UNITED–STATES–AMERICA, MEM–ANGLIA–WAR–MEXICAN–AMERICAN).

II. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves the Colorado River as **Anglia’s arid-lands
chokepoint**: the river that supplies the US Southwest and northern
Mexico, that is allocated by treaty and compact (1922, 1944), and
that makes large-scale settlement in California, Arizona, and Nevada
structurally dependent on controlled flow—dams, canals, and law.

The Colorado is not a border; it is **where water and border
intersect**—allocation decides who gets what, and the delta becomes
a US–Mexico procedural question.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

H.W. Brands (*The Age of Gold* [2002]) centers the California Gold Rush and westward migration as the trigger for massive settlement of the Far West—the same region that would later depend on the Colorado River for water (ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-SECONDARY].

SOURCE — Brands, *The Age of Gold* (ARC-T-MODERN) (thematic; verbatim page ref to be added):
> The gold discovery triggered the largest migration in American history;
> hundreds of thousands scrambled to California by every route imaginable—
> across the Pacific, around Cape Horn, through the Isthmus of Panama,
> and across America's unsettled wilderness.
> — H.W. Brands, *The Age of Gold: The California Gold Rush and the New American Dream* (2002) (ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-SECONDARY]

That migration established the **demand basin** that the Colorado River would later be asked to supply. The river thus encodes **allocation as procedure**: who gets water, by what compact, and at whose cost.

III. GEO STRUCTURED DATA (LAYER 2)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

GEOGRAPHIC PARAMETERS (REQUIRED)
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| REGION_BOUNDS | Colorado River basin: headwaters (Rocky Mtns) through Upper Basin (WY, CO, UT, NM) and Lower Basin (AZ, CA, NV) to US–Mexico border and delta (Baja California, Sonora) |
| TERRAIN_TYPE | Riverine |
| CLIMATE_ZONE | Arid / semi-arid; snowmelt-driven flow; highly variable annual yield |
| KEY_FEATURES | Hoover Dam (Boulder Canyon); Glen Canyon Dam; Grand Canyon; Lower Colorado (All-American Canal, Imperial Valley); Colorado River Delta (Mexico); 1944 treaty delivery point |

STRATEGIC SIGNIFICANCE (REQUIRED)
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| CHOKEPOINT | Yes: major dams (Hoover, Glen Canyon) control flow; allocation regime (1922 Compact, 1944 US–Mexico treaty) fixes entitlements; control of storage = control of supply |
| PROJECTION_CORRIDOR | Yes: irrigation and municipal canals project water into arid basins (Imperial Valley, LA, Phoenix, Las Vegas); corridor value is water, not troops |
| DEFENSE_BALANCE | Neutral for military projection; offense/defense irrelevant—scarcity and allocation dominate; upstream/downstream and federal/state tensions structure conflict |
| RESOURCE_SIGNIFICANCE | Water (agricultural, municipal, industrial); single dominant resource; overallocation relative to long-term yield creates structural deficit |

CONTROL SEQUENCE (REQUIRED)
| Era | Controller | Control Mode | Entry | Exit |
|-----|------------|--------------|-------|------|
| Pre–Anglian | Indigenous polities; Spain/Mexico | Nomadic / Settled; Colonial | — | 1848 |
| US acquisition | United States | Colonial / Contested | 1848 (Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo) | — |
| Allocation regime | US (federal + basin states); Mexico (treaty share) | Imperial / Settled | 1922 (Colorado River Compact); 1944 (US–Mexico treaty) | Extant |

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. STRATEGIC ANALYSIS — SCARCITY AND CHOKEPOINT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Colorado River imposes a **structural constraint** on arid-lands settlement.

Terrain geometry:
• Snowmelt-driven flow; high interannual variability; long-term average yield (~15–16 MAF) is overallocated by compact and treaty.
• Single-thread river with major storage nodes (Lake Mead, Lake Powell); control of dams = control of release.
• Lower Basin (California, Arizona, Nevada) and Mexico depend on Upper Basin and federal storage; upstream states hold structural leverage but are bound by compact.

Power distribution implications:
• 1922 Colorado River Compact allocates flow between Upper and Lower Basin; 1944 US–Mexico treaty guarantees Mexico a share. **Allocation is procedure**—who gets how much, by what law.
• Hoover Dam (1936) and Glen Canyon Dam (1966) create **storage chokepoints**; federal (Reclamation) and state interests negotiate within the Law of the River.
• California’s priority and Arizona’s Central Arizona Project embed **political geography** in canal routes; shortage rules (e.g. 2007 guidelines, 2019 DCP) allocate scarcity when supply falls.

Defense balance: not military. **Scarcity balance** dominates—overuse vs. yield, senior vs. junior rights, US vs. Mexico at the delta. The river encodes **allocation as legitimacy**: who is entitled to water, and who bears shortage.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. STRATEGIC ANALYSIS — BORDER, DELTA, AND LEGITIMACY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Anglian relevance turns on **who controls the flow** and **who gets the delta**.

US–Mexico (1944): Mexico receives a guaranteed annual quantity (1.5 MAF under normal conditions); the river becomes an **international procedural object**. Delta restoration and shortage sharing (e.g. Minute 323, 2017) extend procedure into ecological and variability management.

California and the Southwest: the Gold Rush and later migration (Brands: “largest migration in American history”) populated a region that **cannot support that population without imported water**. The Colorado is the principal imported source. Legitimacy of settlement thus depends on **allocation legitimacy**—compact, treaty, and court.

The river encodes **two Anglian (and one Mexican) claims**: US federal, US state (seven basin states), and Mexico. Procedure—Law of the River—mediates; it does not resolve. Tension between allocation and hydrology is permanent.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. ARC-T-ANCIENT / ARC-T-MEDIEVAL (ANGLIAN RECORD)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
No Anglian record for the Colorado River in ARC-T-ANCIENT or ARC-T-MEDIEVAL. The river enters Anglian strategic cognition with US acquisition of the Southwest (1848) and consolidation of allocation (20th century). Placeholder for future ARC-T-ANCIENT/MEDIEVAL sources if applicable to pre-Anglian or comparative civilizational use.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. ARC-T-EARLY-MOD (EARLY MODERN)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Spanish and Mexican period (pre-1848) establish prior use and delta settlement; US annexation (Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo) transfers sovereignty. Early US exploration (e.g. Powell, 1869) and reclamation discourse set stage for 20th-century allocation. Placeholder for verbatim ARC-T-EARLY-MOD quotation when source is added to CIV–ARC–ANGLIA.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VIII. CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Colorado River encodes **water as procedural object** and **allocation as legitimacy**.

Lessons:
• Arid-lands settlement depends on controlled flow; dams and canals create **chokepoints** and **corridors** of supply.
• Allocation (compact, treaty) fixes entitlements; scarcity forces renegotiation (shortage sharing, delta minutes)—procedure adapts but does not erase dependence.
• The same river sustains US Southwest and Mexico; **border and water intersect** at the delta and in treaty.

The Colorado is where Anglian (and Mexican) settlement **meets hydrologic limit** and where **allocation is fixed by law**—until the next shortage.

• MEM–ANGLIA–NATIVE–AMERICANS (tribal water rights, basin indigenous presence)

Dependency: This MEM supports allocation-regime and arid-lands-corridor reasoning. Breaks if removed: continuity between Rockies (source) and Pacific-demand basins (California); US–Mexico water as procedural object.

Cross-references denote lineage, not equivalence.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
X. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• The Colorado River is the principal chokepoint for US Southwest and northern Mexico water supply.
• Allocation (1922 Compact, 1944 treaty) fixes entitlements; scarcity and shortage rules allocate deficit.
• Settlement (Brands: Gold Rush, westward migration) created the demand; the river’s overallocation encodes **procedure ahead of hydrology**.
• Border and water intersect at the delta; US–Mexico treaty and minutes extend procedure into shortage and ecology.

Tension preserved without verdict.
