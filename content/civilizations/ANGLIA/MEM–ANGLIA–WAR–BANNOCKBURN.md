I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves the Battle of Bannockburn as **Anglia’s structural
defeat in Scotland**: the event that confirmed Scottish independence
under Robert the Bruce, ended Edward I’s and Edward II’s claim to
overlordship, and fixed the northern limit of Plantagenet projection.

Bannockburn is not a skirmish.
It is **limit**.

English authority does not extend north by right of conquest after 1314.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

Winston Churchill, in *A History of the English-Speaking Peoples*, Vol. 1 (*The Birth of Britain* [1956]), Ch. 19 (“Bannockburn”), devotes a chapter to the battle and its consequences for Scottish identity and English reach. Churchill frames Bannockburn as the decisive reversal of English ambition in Scotland—the point at which the Bruce’s cause and Scottish resistance crystallize into lasting independence (ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-SECONDARY]. Verbatim expansion from Churchill, *The Birth of Britain*, Ch. 19 to be added when source is consulted.

II. PRE-BATTLE CONTEXT: EDWARD I’S LEGACY & EDWARD II’S WEAKNESS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Edward I had asserted overlordship over Scotland, intervened in
succession, and died (1307) en route to another campaign. Edward II
inherited the claim but not the same capacity for sustained war.

Key elements:
• Robert the Bruce crowned King of Scots (1306); guerrilla resistance and consolidation
• English-held Stirling Castle under siege; Edward II marches north to relieve it (1314)
• Bruce chooses ground at Bannockburn—narrow front, marsh and stream—to negate English cavalry and numerical advantage

The battle is **chosen** by the Scots: time, place, and conditions favor defense.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. THE BATTLE: STRUCTURAL REVERSAL
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
On 23–24 June 1314, Scottish schiltrons (dense spear formations) and
cavalry counterattacks break the English army.

Dynamics include:
• English cavalry unable to penetrate Scottish spears; terrain restricts maneuver
• English archers poorly integrated; Scottish cavalry neutralizes them
• English command and cohesion collapse; Edward II flees
• Heavy English casualties and capture of nobles; ransom and political cost

The outcome is not marginal. It is **decisive**: the English army in Scotland is destroyed; Stirling falls; the Bruce’s kingship is secured.

IV. CONSEQUENCES: SCOTLAND CONFIRMED, ANGLIAN LIMIT FIXED
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Bannockburn fixes the northern limit of Anglian (English) projection.

Effects include:
• Recognition of Robert I as King of Scots; Treaty of Edinburgh–Northampton (1328) formally renounces English overlordship (under Edward III the claim is later revived, but Bannockburn’s symbolic weight remains)
• Scottish identity and sovereignty anchored in military victory and Bruce’s leadership
• England’s northern frontier becomes a **border**, not a zone of absorption

Anglia does not absorb Scotland. Scotland remains a separate kingdom; Bannockburn is the battle that made that outcome durable.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Bannockburn encodes **defeat as limit** and **resistance as sovereignty**.

Lessons:
• Conquest is reversible; structural defeat fixes borders.
• Terrain and tactics can negate numerical superiority.
• Sovereign identity can be consolidated by victory against a stronger claimant.
• Anglia’s north has a limit—Scotland defines it.

Bannockburn is Anglia’s northern Hastings in reverse: the battle that ended expansion, not the one that began it.

VII. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Bannockburn fixes Scotland as independent of English conquest.
• Structural defeat defines border; Anglia’s north has a limit.
• Terrain and tactics can reverse numerical advantage.
• The battle that ends expansion is as civilizing as the one that begins it—in reverse.

Tension preserved without verdict.
