I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves **Parliament** as Anglia’s consent-and-representation
institution: the body that emerges from Magna Carta’s demand for
common counsel, that is regularized under Edward I, and that Churchill
calls the “Mother of Parliaments”—the “seed-time” of the parliamentary
system and a “fire never to be quenched” in English history.

Parliament is not democracy.
It is **consent as procedure**.

It preserves legitimacy by tying taxation and law to consultation and
to the cooperation of the three estates—barons, clergy, commons—so
that the crown governs with, not over, the realm.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

Winston Churchill, in *A History of the English-Speaking Peoples*, Vol. 1 (*The Birth of Britain* [1956]), Ch. 15 (Magna Carta) and Ch. 17 (“The Mother of Parliaments”), traces Parliament’s emergence from Runnymede and the Provisions of Oxford. He names the 13th century “a great age of Parliamentary development and experiment” (255). Magna Carta contained “no mention…of Parliament or representation of any but the baronial class” (255)—yet it established the doctrine that “custom and the law must stand even above the King” (253), to which appeal has been made “again and again…and never, as yet, without success” (257). From the Provisions of Oxford (1258) and Simon de Montfort’s legacy, Churchill writes that “the seed-time of the Parliamentary system” was achieved (273); de Montfort had “lighted a fire never to be quenched in English history”—the fire for representative government (284) (ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-SECONDARY].

II. ORIGINS: MAGNA CARTA & COMMON COUNSEL
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Parliament does not begin as a theory. It begins as **extraction and constraint**.

Context includes:
• Magna Carta (1215): no taxation without common counsel; king under law
• Clause 12 and 39: consent and lawful judgment as conditions of legitimacy
• Baronial coercion, not moral awakening—but once written, constraint can be cited

The crown needs revenue; the realm can withhold consent. Parliament emerges as the **place where consent is negotiated**—first barons only, then clergy and knights, then burgesses. Edward I’s Model Parliament (1295) invokes “what touches all should be approved by all”; the principle is procedural, not democratic.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. PROVISIONS OF OXFORD & SIMON DE MONTFORT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The “Mother of Parliaments” has a contested birth.

In 1258 the Provisions of Oxford impose an elected council on Henry III;
Simon de Montfort leads the baronial opposition and, in 1264–1265, summons
assemblies that include knights and burgesses—not only magnates. Civil war
follows; de Montfort is killed (1265); the Provisions are annulled, then
partially restored. The precedent **survives**: the crown must consult;
representation expands.

Churchill frames the Provisions as the “seed-time of the Parliamentary system” and de Montfort as lighting “a fire never to be quenched.” The fire is for **representative government**—the idea that the realm’s consent is institutionalized, not occasional.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. EDWARD I & THE REGULARIZATION OF PARLIAMENT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Under Edward I, Parliament becomes a **regular** part of political life.

Dynamics include:
• Summons of clergy, knights, and burgesses for taxation and consent
• “What touches all should be approved by all”—common dangers, common remedies
• Cooperation of the three estates as the basis of the State (Churchill: “path between despotism and anarchy”)

Parliament is not yet sovereign. The crown summons and dissolves it. But the **habit** of consent—and the cost of ruling without it—is established. Law and custom stand above the king; appeal to that doctrine becomes the enduring recourse when the State overreaches (Churchill, 257).

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Parliament encodes **consent as procedure** and **representation as durability**.

Lessons:
• Taxation and law require consultation; legitimacy depends on it.
• The “fire for representative government” is lit in conflict—barons vs. crown, de Montfort vs. Henry III—but the institution outlives the conflict.
• Custom and law stand above the king; Parliament is the forum where that standing is asserted.
• The Mother of Parliaments is not a blueprint; it is a seed-time—slow, contested, and durable.

Parliament is Anglia’s institutionalization of “never, as yet, without success.”

VII. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Parliament emerges from Magna Carta and the Provisions of Oxford—consent as procedure.
• De Montfort lights “a fire never to be quenched”; the seed-time of the parliamentary system is achieved in conflict.
• Custom and law stand above the king; appeal to this doctrine has “never, as yet, without success.”
• The Mother of Parliaments is procedural, not ideological—durability through consultation.

Tension preserved without verdict.
