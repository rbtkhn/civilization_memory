I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves the Ohio Valley as **Anglia's backcountry legitimacy
frontier**: the theater where French and British imperial claims
collide, where the Seven Years' War begins, and where procedure—
who controls the valley, by what authority—is decided by force
and diplomacy before it is stabilized by law.

The Ohio Valley is not a sidebar to the war.
It is **where the war begins**.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

Fred Anderson (*Crucible of War* [2000]) centers the war's origin in the Ohio: "a chaotic competition of two empires to control the Ohio Valley"; the interests of the Iroquois Confederacy, New France, Virginia, and Anglo-American land speculators "all converged" at the Allegheny–Monongahela–Ohio (ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-SECONDARY].

SOURCE — Anderson, *Crucible of War* (ARC-T-MODERN):
> The Seven Years' War could not have begun unless a single desperate
> Iroquois chief had tried to keep the French from seizing control of
> the Ohio Valley; nor could the war have reached the conclusion it did,
> and created the consequences it did, without the participation of
> native peoples.
> — Fred Anderson, *Crucible of War* (2000) (ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-SECONDARY]

II. IMPERIAL CONVERGENCE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Control of the Ohio Valley draws multiple actors into collision.

Context:
• French claims and forts in the upper Ohio
• Virginia's colonial ambition and land speculation
• Iroquois (Six Nations) diplomatic maneuvering
• British imperial policy and military backing

The valley is **contested procedure**: no single authority is recognized.

Legitimacy is asserted, not inherited.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. JUMONVILLE'S GLEN & THE OUTBREAK OF WAR
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The war begins in a backcountry skirmish (May 1754).

Key elements:
• George Washington, Virginia militia, in the Ohio country
• Tanaghrisson ("Half King"), Iroquois ally, guiding and constraining Washington
• French detachment under Jumonville; encounter at the glen
• Escalation from diplomatic mission to armed clash to massacre

Anderson frames the moment as contingency, not destiny:

> Nothing could have been further from Washington's mind, or more alien
> to the designs of the men who had entrusted him with troops and ordered
> him to the Ohio Valley, than beginning a war. Neither he nor his masters
> imagined that they were setting in train events that would destroy the
> American empire of France.
> — Fred Anderson, *Crucible of War* (2000) (ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-SECONDARY]

Procedure is **incomplete**: no clear chain of command, no agreed rules of engagement, no metropolitan control over the backcountry.

IV. FROM OHIO TO GLOBAL WAR
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The conflict that begins in the Ohio spreads.

Anderson:
> The ensuing conflict spread from North America to Europe, the Caribbean
> basin, West Africa, India, and the Philippine archipelago: in a real
> although more limited sense than we intend when we apply the words to
> twentieth-century conflicts, a world war.
> — Fred Anderson, *Crucible of War* (2000) (ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-SECONDARY]

The Ohio Valley is **origin, not limit**. Anglia's ability to sustain war across theaters—and to secure the Ohio and Canada—validates maritime-financial logic.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Ohio Valley encodes **imperial competition as procedure**.

Lessons:
• Backcountry events can trigger system-level war.
• Native polities (Iroquois, etc.) shape imperial outcomes.
• Control of geography is asserted before it is institutionalized.
• Anglia's victory in the Ohio is a precondition of empire—and of its later strain.

The valley is where Anglia's American empire **begins in violence** and where its limits are first tested.

**Structural type:** Ohio is a **continental corridor**—interests
converge at a geographic point; victory creates scale but also
deferred governance stress (post-1763). Contrast with **maritime
choke** (Suez): corridor concentrates stress that outlives victory;
choke permits procedural control and survivable exit.

**Structural logic:** Continental corridors concentrate governance
stress that outlives victory; the Ohio encodes the former—deferred
strain (post-1763) that Britain was ill-prepared to resolve.

VI. CROSS-REFERENCED MEM FILES
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• MEM–ANGLIA–WAR–SEVEN–YEARS (global war whose origin is the Ohio)
• MEM–ANGLIA–WASHINGTON (Washington in Ohio, 1754)
• MEM–ANGLIA–CANADA (conquest of Canada as climax; Ohio as prelude)
• MEM–ANGLIA–BRITISH–EMPIRE (empire enlarged by victory; Ohio as one theater)
• MEM–ANGLIA–NATIVE–AMERICANS (Iroquois, Tanaghrisson, native participation)

Cross-references denote lineage, not equivalence.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• The Ohio Valley is the geographic pivot of the Seven Years' War.
• Imperial procedure is established by force before it is codified by law.
• Native actors are central to the war's outbreak and outcome.
• Anglia's victory in the Ohio enables empire—and later confronts Britons and colonists with the problems Anderson describes.

Tension preserved without verdict.
