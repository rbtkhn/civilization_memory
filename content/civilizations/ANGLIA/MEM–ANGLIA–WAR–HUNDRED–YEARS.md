I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves the Hundred Years’ War as **Anglia’s decisive
continental overreach and corrective withdrawal**: the prolonged conflict
in which dynastic ambition abroad collided with structural limits,
producing learning through loss rather than civilizational collapse.

For Anglia, the war does not represent defeat in isolation.
It represents **the discovery of what Anglia is not built to absorb**.

This file records strategic learning under extended pressure, not
military failure alone.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. STRATEGIC CONTEXT & ENTRY CONDITIONS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Anglia enters the war as a dynastic claimant, not a civilizational
absorber.

Context includes:
• Plantagenet inheritance of continental territories
• Feudal legitimacy claims to the French crown
• Confidence derived from earlier battlefield success
• Assumptions of elite replaceability through conquest

Primary Source Anchor A — Edward III’s Claim (1337)

> “We, having just and rightful cause, do challenge and demand the
> crown of France, as descended unto us by lawful succession, and we do
> this not by force of arms alone, but by right and reason.”
> — Edward III, proclamation to the French peers, 1337

Analytical Function:
The claim is legal-dynastic, not civilizational. It assumes that title
can substitute for absorption capacity.

Provenance Confidence: HIGH

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. EARLY OPERATIONAL SUCCESS & ILLUSION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Early phases favor Anglia tactically.

Conditions include:
• Longbow-infantry dominance
• Superior battlefield discipline
• Naval mobility enabling expeditionary campaigns
• Fragmented Francien aristocratic response

Primary Source Anchor B — Froissart on Crécy and Poitiers

> “The Englishmen stood still, and the Frenchmen came on fiercely; but
> they were so sore beaten that they could not advance, for the arrows
> fell so thick among them that many were slain or sore wounded.”
> — Jean Froissart, *Chroniques*, c. 1370s

Analytical Function:
Froissart records tactical superiority but does not describe governance,
control, or absorption. Victory produces confidence without conversion.

Provenance Confidence: HIGH

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. STRUCTURAL LIMITS EMERGE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Battlefield success fails to translate into durable control.

Constraints include:
• Geographic distance from Anglia’s legitimacy core
• Escalating fiscal strain on crown and elites
• Mercenary reliance and loyalty instability
• Absence of administrative absorption mechanisms
• Francien cultural resistance to elite replacement

John Keegan emphasizes that the war reveals a mismatch between **tactical
competence and strategic sustainability**, noting that Anglia could win
battles without possessing the institutional depth required to rule
France. On the restraint that institutions impose on violence he writes:

SOURCE — Keegan, *A History of Warfare* (ARC-T-MODERN):
> "Our institutions and our laws, we tell ourselves, have set the human
> potentiality for violence about with such restraints that violence in
> everyday life will be punished as criminal by our laws, while its use
> by our institutions of state will take the particular form of
> 'civilised warfare.'"
> — John Keegan, *A History of Warfare* (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1993) (ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-SECONDARY].

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. WAR AS MANAGED PERSISTENCE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
As decisive victory recedes, Anglia adapts.

Responses include:
• Acceptance of prolonged stalemate
• Focus on defensible territories (e.g., Gascony, Calais)
• Increased reliance on parliamentary bargaining for finance
• Shift from conquest logic to damage limitation

Primary Source Anchor C — Parliamentary Finance Pressure

> “The commons, considering the great charges and continual expenses
> sustained by the king in his wars beyond the sea, did grant subsidy,
> yet with petition that the realm be not further burdened without
> common assent.”
> — Rolls of Parliament, late 14th century

Analytical Function:
The war accelerates the integration of parliamentary consent into
war-making, foreshadowing Anglia’s later fiscal-procedural model.

Provenance Confidence: HIGH

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. WITHDRAWAL WITHOUT SYSTEMIC FAILURE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Loss does not collapse Anglia’s core institutions.

Outcomes:
• Gradual abandonment of continental dynastic claims
• Preservation of the ruling dynasty
• No regime extinction
• No elite decapitation at home

This contrasts sharply with Hastings (1066), where defeat destroyed the
elite substrate itself.

Here, Anglia exits **without rupture**.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. INSULAR & MARITIME REORIENTATION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Post-war Anglia redirects civilizational energy.

Shifts include:
• Reduced continental entanglement
• Strengthening of naval investment
• Expansion of parliamentary fiscal authority
• Preference for indirect power projection

Carroll Quigley identifies this transition as the moment Anglia begins
to replace **territorial ambition** with **systemic leverage**.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VIII. DISTINGUISHED SCHOLAR ENGAGEMENT (ANGLIA)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• **John Keegan** — Tactical brilliance cannot substitute for
  administrative absorption.
• **Winston Churchill** — The war teaches England the cost of foreign
  crowns and the value of insular focus.
• **Carroll Quigley** — Failure functions as civilizational learning,
  redirecting institutional evolution.
• **Niall Ferguson** — Fiscal-military pressure accelerates procedural
  governance rather than absolutism.

Scholar engagement is analytical, not commemorative.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
X. CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Hundred Years’ War encodes **strategic exit as intelligence**.

Lessons:
• Dynastic legitimacy cannot replace absorption capacity.
• Tactical superiority does not scale governance.
• Withdrawal can preserve continuity.
• Failure can clarify civilizational direction.
• Anglia learns what it must not pursue.

This is Anglia’s first sustained lesson in **replacement without reset**.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
XI. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Dynastic conquest abroad strains procedural systems.
• Victory without absorption is illusory.
• Loss can strengthen civilizations that adapt early.
• Parliamentary bargaining accelerates under fiscal stress.
• The Hundred Years’ War is Anglia’s first strategic exit.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
XII. PEDAGOGICAL AFFORDANCE LAYER
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This MEM supports inquiry into:
• Overreach vs absorption
• Tactical success vs strategic sustainability
• Exit strategies without collapse
• Learning through prolonged failure

No moral judgment is imposed.
