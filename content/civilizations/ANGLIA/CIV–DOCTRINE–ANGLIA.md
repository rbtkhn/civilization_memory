I. PURPOSE & AUTHORITY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file is the **exclusive registry of accepted Anglian
civilizational doctrines**.

It contains:
• Doctrines explicitly accepted via DIB–ANGLIA
• Definitions suitable for CIV–CORE citation
• Controlled illustrative material for training and sequencing clarity
• No learning history
• No beliefs
• No provisional or rejected doctrines (see Section IV)

This file:
• Does NOT learn
• Does NOT synthesize
• Does NOT evolve autonomously

Authority Flow:
CIV–MEM–CORE → CIV–CORE–ANGLIA → DIB–ANGLIA → CIV–DOCTRINE–ANGLIA

Doctrine Admissibility Rules (per Template § III):
A doctrine MAY be entered here ONLY if: (1) it originates from a FROZEN SYNTHESIS
in CIV–SCHOLAR–ANGLIA; (2) the synthesis was explicitly frozen by command; (3) the
doctrine was explicitly accepted by DIB–ANGLIA; (4) a new doctrine version is assigned.
Prohibited: draft doctrines, candidate beliefs, analytical hypotheses, scholar
commentary, historical narration.

Only doctrines listed here may be treated as **authoritative**.
Illustrative and relational material is **non-authoritative and non-citable**.

II. DOCTRINAL RELATIONSHIP & SEQUENCING OVERVIEW (NON-AUTHORITATIVE)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This section provides **contextual guidance only**.  
It does not introduce requirements, axioms, or binding order.

Purpose:
• Prevent misordered application
• Support training and Scholar-mode traversal
• Clarify co-activation and gating relationships

Key principle:
→ Anglian doctrines function as a **system**, not as independent maxims.

[02 RUPTURE ABSORPTION THROUGH ELITE REPLACEMENT]

[07 MYTH AS STABILIZER, NOT ENGINE]
• Reinforces morale and compliance
• Does not generate power independently
• Never substitutes for procedure or capacity

Sequencing Note:
Misapplication (e.g., invoking delay, coalition logic, or myth without
procedural legitimacy intact) degrades outcomes and may invert effects.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II.B. APPLICATION CAUTION (NON-AUTHORITATIVE)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Doctrine 01 is **foundational**; others presuppose its presence.
• Doctrines 02 and 03 are **rupture-handling doctrines**, not peacetime optimizers.
• Doctrines 04–06 amplify power only when procedural continuity holds.
• Doctrine 07 stabilizes outcomes but cannot initiate them.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. DOCTRINE REGISTRY (AUTHORITATIVE)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

DOCTRINE 01
Name: PROCEDURE AS CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY
Status: ACCEPTED · LOCKED · CANONICAL
Source: CIV–SCHOLAR–ANGLIA → DIB–ANGLIA (Approved)

Definition:
Anglia preserves civilizational continuity not primarily through
territory, dynasty, or ideology, but through **procedure**: repeatable,
precedent-based processes that encode authority, legitimacy, and dispute
resolution across time. Procedure functions as memory, allowing Anglia
to survive regime loss, territorial contraction, and moral contradiction
without civilizational reset.

Operational Meaning:
• Authority resides in process, not persons
• Continuity survives defeat if procedure remains intact
• Law, precedent, and institutional habit substitute for ideology

Illustrative Cases (Non-Authoritative):
• Magna Carta → precedent survives initial failure
• Common Law → continuity through iterative judgment
• Post-1688 governance → regime change without reset

Related Doctrines (Contextual, Non-Authoritative):
• Doctrine 02 (Rupture Absorption)
• Doctrine 03 (Defeat Without Collapse)
• Doctrine 07 (Myth as Stabilizer)

Hard Constraints:
• Procedure fails if enforcement collapses entirely
• Procedure degrades if legitimacy outpaces perceived fairness
• Procedure cannot compensate for total elite eradication (see Doctrine 02)

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

DOCTRINE 02
Name: RUPTURE ABSORPTION THROUGH ELITE REPLACEMENT
Status: ACCEPTED · LOCKED · CANONICAL

Definition:
Anglia can survive even catastrophic defeat when rupture results in
**elite replacement rather than institutional annihilation**. Invasion
or loss becomes survivable if new elites adopt, hybridize with, or are
absorbed into Anglia’s procedural grammar, rather than destroying it.

Operational Meaning:
• Defeat is survivable if institutions are repurposed, not erased
• Elite continuity is less important than institutional continuity
• Hybridization can strengthen long-term durability

Illustrative Cases (Non-Authoritative):
• Norman Conquest (1066) → elite replacement, institutional survival
• Post-imperial transitions → administrative continuity without empire

Related Doctrines (Contextual, Non-Authoritative):
• Doctrine 01 (Procedure as Memory)
• Doctrine 03 (Defeat Without Collapse)

Hard Constraints:
• Rupture becomes terminal if procedures are fully dismantled
• Replacement fails if new elites rule purely through coercion
• Total cultural erasure invalidates absorption

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

DOCTRINE 03
Name: DEFEAT WITHOUT LEGITIMACY COLLAPSE
Status: ACCEPTED · LOCKED · CANONICAL

Definition:
Anglia can lose wars, territory, and imperial status without internal
legitimacy collapse, provided defeat is **procedurally managed**.

Operational Meaning:
• Parliamentary debate substitutes for regime crisis
• Exit preserves legitimacy better than denial
• Retrenchment is a strategic option, not failure

Illustrative Cases (Non-Authoritative):
• Yorktown (1781)
• Imperial withdrawals with legal continuity

Related Doctrines (Contextual, Non-Authoritative):
• Doctrine 01 (Procedure)
• Doctrine 02 (Rupture Absorption)

Hard Constraints:
• Defeat destabilizes if framed as illegitimate
• Procedural exit requires elite compliance
• Repeated defeats without adaptation erode confidence

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

DOCTRINE 04
Name: TIME AS A STRATEGIC WEAPON
Status: ACCEPTED · LOCKED · CANONICAL

Definition:
Anglia converts time into power through finance, institutional patience,
and coalition endurance.

Operational Meaning:
• Delay favors systems with fiscal continuity
• Attrition is preferable to decisive confrontation
• Victory achieved by outlasting, not overpowering

Illustrative Cases (Non-Authoritative):
• Napoleonic Wars (long war finance)
• Cold War–era endurance logic

Related Doctrines (Contextual, Non-Authoritative):
• Doctrine 05 (Coalition Primacy)
• Doctrine 06 (Naval Denial)

Hard Constraints:
• Fiscal collapse negates time advantage
• Coalition fracture nullifies delay
• Time cannot compensate for procedural loss

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

DOCTRINE 05
Name: COALITION PRIMACY OVER SINGULAR VICTORY
Status: ACCEPTED · LOCKED · CANONICAL

Definition:
Anglia maximizes power by subordinating authorship to coalition durability.

Operational Meaning:
• Allies absorb cost Anglia avoids
• Victory legitimacy externalized
• Balance prioritized over dominance

Illustrative Cases (Non-Authoritative):
• Grand Alliance systems
• Post-1815 balance enforcement

Related Doctrines (Contextual, Non-Authoritative):
• Doctrine 04 (Time)
• Doctrine 06 (Naval Denial)

Hard Constraints:
• Coalitions fail without finance/naval support
• Delegation fails if command integration collapses
• Ineffective vs legitimacy-immune adversaries

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

DOCTRINE 06
Name: NAVAL DENIAL AS EXISTENTIAL DEFENSE
Status: ACCEPTED · LOCKED · CANONICAL

Definition:
Anglia’s survival depends on denial of hostile movement, not conquest.

Operational Meaning:
• Sea control substitutes for land mass
• Invasion prevention outweighs battle victory
• Maritime dominance converts geography into security

Illustrative Cases (Non-Authoritative):
• Napoleonic blockade strategy
• Channel denial across centuries

Related Doctrines (Contextual, Non-Authoritative):
• Doctrine 04 (Time)
• Doctrine 05 (Coalition Primacy)

Hard Constraints:
• Naval failure exposes the core immediately
• Denial fails if logistics collapse
• Control must be continuous

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

DOCTRINE 07
Name: MYTH AS STABILIZER, NOT ENGINE
Status: ACCEPTED · LOCKED · CANONICAL

Definition:
Anglia uses myth to stabilize institutions, not to generate power.

Operational Meaning:
• Narrative reinforces compliance
• Symbolism sustains morale during loss
• Myth follows success; it does not create it

Illustrative Cases (Non-Authoritative):
• Wartime rhetoric without regime change
• Post-defeat national narratives

Related Doctrines (Contextual, Non-Authoritative):
• Doctrine 01 (Procedure)
• Doctrine 03 (Defeat Without Collapse)

Hard Constraints:
• Myth collapses if contradicted by procedure
• Symbolism cannot override institutional failure
• Narrative without enforcement accelerates decay
