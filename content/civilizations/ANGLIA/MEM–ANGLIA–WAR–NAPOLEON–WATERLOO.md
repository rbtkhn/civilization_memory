I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves Waterloo as Anglia's confirmation of system
supremacy through endurance and coalition management: the culminating
battle in which Anglia's long-developed method—finance, patience,
alliances, and controlled exposure—finally terminates a rival's
personalist and universalist project.

For Anglia, Waterloo is not a moment of glory.
It is closure without transformation.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. WATERLOO AS ENDPOINT, NOT ORIGIN
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
By 1815, Anglia has already won the war systemically.

Conditions:
• Sustained financial solvency
• Mature coalition infrastructure
• Naval dominance maintained throughout the conflict cycle
• Institutional continuity unaffected by regime change

Waterloo does not create Anglian power.
It merely ends resistance to it.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. COALITION WARFARE AT FULL MATURITY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Waterloo reflects Anglia's preferred war grammar.

Characteristics:
• Coalition primacy over national spectacle
• Delegation of continental mass warfare
• Integration of allied command structures
• Acceptance of shared victory

Anglia does not seek singular battlefield authorship.

Victory is collective by design.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. TIME AS STRATEGIC WEAPON
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Anglia arrives at Waterloo with time on its side.

Dynamics:
• Willingness to fight prolonged wars
• Capacity to absorb cost without legitimacy rupture
• Strategic patience enforced by finance and institutions

Where Napoleon requires decision,
Anglia requires only persistence.

Delay functions as pressure.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. BATTLE AS PROCEDURAL TERMINATION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The battle matters because it ends the cycle.

Effects:
• Coalition credibility validated
• Bonapartist resurgence foreclosed
• No requirement for further escalation

Anglia does not mythologize the field.

The objective is not annihilation,
but finality.

Winston Churchill, in *A History of the English-Speaking Peoples*, Vol. 3 (*The Age of Revolution* [1956–1958]), closes the volume with Napoleon's defeat at Waterloo, framing it as the endpoint of the Age of Revolution and the confirmation of Britain's coalition-and-endurance method (ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-SECONDARY].

SOURCE — Churchill, *The Age of Revolution* (Vol. 3) (ARC-T-MODERN):
> Churchill's *The Age of Revolution* begins with Marlborough's Blenheim and ends with Napoleon's defeat at Waterloo—the volume tells the story of Britain's rise to world leadership through the long Anglo-French rivalry and the Napoleonic Wars.

SOURCE — Kissinger, *A World Restored* (ARC-T-MODERN):
> Waterloo marked the terminal containment of Napoleon, but the Vienna settlement that followed reflected Britain's restraint under Castlereagh. Unlike Metternich's continental interventionism, Britain's approach emphasized balance-of-power management and diplomatic restraint, shaping a post-Napoleonic order that reflected Britain's preference for system stability over revolutionary transformation.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. LEGITIMACY UNAFFECTED BY OUTCOME
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Unlike Francia, Anglia's legitimacy does not hinge on Waterloo.

Observations:
• No personal authority at stake
• No regime identity bound to victory
• No civilizational narrative endangered by failure

Victory strengthens confidence,
but defeat would not have shattered order.

This asymmetry is decisive.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. POST-WAR ORDER AS SYSTEM MANAGEMENT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
After Waterloo, Anglia prioritizes stability.

Outcomes:
• Support for restoration as containment, not belief
• Balance-of-power enforcement
• Prevention of renewed continental consolidation

Anglia governs the settlement,
but does not dominate it.

Order matters more than authorship.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VIII. CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Waterloo encodes Anglia's anti-charismatic doctrine.

Lessons:
• Systems outlast individuals
• Coalitions defeat brilliance through endurance
• Finance and legitimacy compound silently
• Closure is preferable to spectacle

Waterloo confirms method, not destiny.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IX. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Anglia wins by waiting, not rushing.
• Victory need not transform identity to be decisive.
• Coalition warfare substitutes for personal genius.
• Legitimacy that survives loss is stronger than legitimacy that requires victory.
• Waterloo ends Napoleon, not Anglia's way of war.

Tension preserved without verdict.
