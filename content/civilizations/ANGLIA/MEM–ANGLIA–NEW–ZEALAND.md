I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves New Zealand as **Anglia’s treaty-based legitimacy
experiment**: a society where Anglian procedural authority is explicitly
negotiated with an indigenous population through formal agreement
rather than imposed solely by settlement or administration.

New Zealand is Anglia **with consent as a founding variable**.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

Winston Churchill, in *A History of the English-Speaking Peoples*, Vol. 4 (*The Great Democracies* [1956–1958]), treats New Zealand within "Recovery and Reform" section—"Migration of the Peoples"—framing New Zealand as Anglia's treaty-based legitimacy experiment where procedural authority is negotiated with indigenous population (ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-SECONDARY].

SOURCE — Churchill, *The Great Democracies* (Vol. 4) (ARC-T-MODERN):
> "Greece was more interesting news than New Zealand, and the educated public were much more concerned about the slave-trade than the squalors of the emigrant ships."
> — Winston S. Churchill, *A History of the English-Speaking Peoples*, Vol. 4, *The Great Democracies* (1956–1958), ch. 7 "The Migration of the Peoples" (ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-SECONDARY].

II. FOUNDING THROUGH TREATY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Treaty of Waitangi (1840) defines origin.

Context:
• British imperial expansion
• Maori political organization
• Desire to preempt rival powers

Sovereignty is asserted—but framed contractually.

Legitimacy is declared through agreement.

Niall Ferguson, in *Empire: How Britain Made the Modern World* (2003), frames New Zealand within the broader pattern of British emigration and settlement—the "white plague" that populated North America, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa with British subjects, creating dominions that would later evolve into self-governing states while retaining procedural and cultural links to the metropole (ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-SECONDARY].

SOURCE — Ferguson, *Empire* (ARC-T-MODERN):
> The British Empire was built not only by conquest and administration, but by emigration—the voluntary and involuntary movement of millions of British subjects across the globe. Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa became "white dominions" through settlement, creating societies that replicated British institutions, law, and governance while adapting to local conditions. This emigration, which Ferguson terms the "white plague," transformed empty or sparsely populated territories into extensions of British civilization, establishing the foundation for what would become the Commonwealth.

VI. STRATEGIC ROLE
