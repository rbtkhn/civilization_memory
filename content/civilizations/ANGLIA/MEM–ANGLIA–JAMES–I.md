I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves James I as **Anglia’s union-of-crowns sovereign**:
the ruler who brought the Scottish and English crowns under one
monarch (1603) without merging the kingdoms—embedding **personal union**
and future constitutional stress into the Stuart inheritance.

James I does not invent multiple kingdoms.
He **embodies** them: James VI of Scotland becomes James I of England;
one king, two realms, no single Parliament or law.

This file does not moralize James’s theology or his court. It preserves
*personal union as structural novelty*: the first Stuart in England,
the king who could not resolve the tension between divine-right claims
and an already-maturing parliamentary and legal culture—and who
bequeathed that tension to Charles I.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

II. UNITED CROWNS & PERSONAL UNION (PRIMARY + SECONDARY)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
James VI of Scotland succeeds Elizabeth I as James I of England (1603).
The union is **personal**, not institutional: one monarch, two
kingdoms, two Parliaments, two systems of law. James styles himself
“King of Great Britain” but the title has no statutory basis in
England until later. The structural consequence is **embedded
fracture**: Scotland and England remain distinct; the crown’s authority
rests on different foundations in each; and the Stuart doctrine of
divine right will collide with English parliamentary and common-law
tradition.

Winston Churchill, in *A History of the English-Speaking Peoples*, Vol. 2 (*The New World* [1956]), opens Book V with “The United Crowns,” framing James’s accession as the moment when the Scottish and English crowns are united under one monarch—and when the strains of governing multiple kingdoms under one person begin to tell (ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-SECONDARY].

SOURCE — Churchill, *The New World* (Vol. 2), Book V (ARC-T-MODERN):
> Churchill’s chapter “The United Crowns” frames James VI & I’s accession as the union of the Scottish and English crowns under one monarch—personal union without institutional merger, and the beginning of the Stuart period in England with its attendant strains.

III. DIVINE RIGHT & PARLIAMENTARY RESISTANCE (PRIMARY + SECONDARY)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
James asserts divine right and the duty of subjects to obey; he
confronts Parliament over taxation, privilege, and the relationship
between king and law. The Gunpowder Plot (1605) and other crises
deepen confessional and political tension. James’s reign does not
produce civil war—but it **prepares** it: his son Charles I will
inherit the same doctrinal and fiscal conflicts without James’s
political caution.

The structural point is that personal union and divine-right doctrine
do not resolve the question of where ultimate authority lies—in the
king’s person or in Parliament and law.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
James I encodes **personal union** and **divine-right doctrine under
stress**. The United Crowns bring Scotland and England under one
monarch; they do not merge the realms. James bequeaths to Charles I
the tension that will erupt in civil war.

Lessons:
• Personal union embeds structural tension—one king, multiple kingdoms, no single institution.
• Divine right and parliamentary tradition coexist uneasily; the strain will outlast James.
• James I is the first Stuart in England—the figure who opened the path to civil war and regicide.

V. MEM CONNECTIONS (STRUCTURAL)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Internal (ANGLIA):
1) MEM–ANGLIA–DYNASTY–STUART
   — James I as first Stuart king in England; United Crowns as dynastic origin.
2) MEM–ANGLIA–CHARLES–I
   — Son inherits divine-right doctrine and parliamentary conflict; civil war and regicide.
3) MEM–ANGLIA–WAR–ENGLISH–CIVIL
   — James’s reign prepares the conflict; fiscal and doctrinal strain under Charles.
4) MEM–ANGLIA–SCOTLAND
   — James VI of Scotland; personal union with England.
5) MEM–ANGLIA–LAW–PARLIAMENT
   — Parliament and privilege under James; strain over taxation and authority.

Cross-Civilizational (structural parallel):
6) MEM–GERMANIA–HOLY–ROMAN–EMPIRE
   — Contrast: personal union and multiple kingdoms (James) vs imperial structure (HRE).

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Personal union does not merge kingdoms—it embeds tension.
• Divine right and parliamentary tradition collide under the Stuarts.
• James I opens the Stuart period in England; Charles I inherits the conflict.
• The United Crowns are the precondition for civil war and regicide.

Tension preserved without verdict.
