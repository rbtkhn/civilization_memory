I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves Charles I as **Anglia’s regicide sovereign**:
the ruler whose personal rule, conflict with Parliament, and defeat in
civil war led to his trial and execution (1649)—the moment when sacral
kingship was broken by procedure and by axe.

Charles I does not invent regicide.
He **suffers** it—and in suffering, encodes the moment when a reigning
monarch can be tried and executed by his own polity in the name of
law and the realm.

This file does not moralize Charles’s policies or Parliament’s actions.
It preserves *regicide as civilizational rupture*: the king placed
under the law, judged, and put to death—and the structural shock that
makes Restoration and the Glorious Revolution (1688) the search for
legitimate authority within new constraints.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

II. PERSONAL RULE & REVOLT OF PARLIAMENT (PRIMARY + SECONDARY)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Charles I rules without Parliament for eleven years (1629–1640)—the
**Personal Rule**—relying on prerogative, fiscal expedients, and
ecclesiastical policy. When he is forced to recall Parliament (1640)
to fund war, opposition hardens. The Long Parliament asserts control
over taxation, ministers, and the army; the king’s attempt to arrest
the Five Members (1642) fails; both sides prepare for war.

Structural consequence: **authority is litigated by arms**. Neither
king nor Parliament can claim undisputed legitimacy; the Civil War
(1642–1651) becomes the arbiter.

Winston Churchill, in *A History of the English-Speaking Peoples*, Vol. 2 (*The New World* [1956]), Book V (“The Civil War”), devotes chapters to “Charles I and Buckingham,” “The Personal Rule,” “The Revolt of Parliament,” “The Great Rebellion,” “Marston Moor and Naseby,” and “The Axe Falls”—framing Charles’s reign as the moment when personal monarchy and parliamentary resistance collide, and when the king is tried and executed in the name of the realm (ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-SECONDARY].

SUMMARY — Churchill, *The New World* (Vol. 2), Book V (ARC-T-MODERN):
Churchill’s chapters on Charles I and Buckingham, the Personal Rule, the Revolt of Parliament, the Great Rebellion, and the Axe Falls frame Charles I’s reign as the collision of personal monarchy and parliamentary resistance—and the execution of the king as the moment when sacral kingship is broken by procedure (non-verbatim summary).

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. THE AXE FALLS: REGICIDE AS RUPTURE (PRIMARY + SECONDARY)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Charles I is tried by a High Court of Justice (January 1649), charged
with high treason against the realm; he refuses to recognise the
court’s jurisdiction. He is convicted and executed (30 January 1649).
The act is framed as justice and necessity by the victors—and as
murder and sacrilege by royalists. The structural point is that **a
reigning monarch has been executed by his own polity** in the name of
law and the people. Sacral kingship is shattered; the crown will be
restored (1660) but under new constraints.

Regicide does not establish a stable republic. It establishes that
the king can be removed—and that the cost of doing so by axe is so
high that later removal (James II, 1688) will be by flight and
parliamentary declaration instead.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Charles I encodes **personal rule as failure** and **regicide as
rupture**. The king who ruled without Parliament is tried and
executed by a court claiming to act for the realm. Sacral kingship
is broken; the crown is restored later, but transformed.

Lessons:
• Personal rule and parliamentary resistance can escalate to civil war and regicide.
• A reigning monarch can be tried and executed by his own polity in the name of law.
• Regicide shatters sacral kingship; Restoration and 1688 will seek legitimacy within new constraints.
• Charles I is the regicide sovereign—the figure who made the axe fall.

V. MEM CONNECTIONS (STRUCTURAL)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Internal (ANGLIA):
1) MEM–ANGLIA–DYNASTY–STUART
   — Charles I as Stuart king; civil war and regicide as dynastic crisis.
2) MEM–ANGLIA–WAR–ENGLISH–CIVIL
   — Civil War; Charles I’s defeat; trial and execution.
3) MEM–ANGLIA–JAMES–I
   — Father; United Crowns and divine right bequeath conflict to Charles.
4) MEM–ANGLIA–JAMES–II
   — Contrast: Charles executed; James II removed by flight and declaration (1688).
5) MEM–ANGLIA–LAW–PARLIAMENT
   — Revolt of Parliament; authority litigated by arms; regicide as procedural rupture.
6) MEM–ANGLIA–LAW–MAGNA–CARTA
   — Constraint precedent; king under law—extended to trial and execution.

Cross-Civilizational (structural parallel):
7) MEM–FRANCIA–LOUIS–XVI
   — Regicide; king tried and executed by revolutionary polity (contrast: French Republic vs English Commonwealth).

VI. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Personal rule can escalate to revolt of Parliament and civil war.
• A reigning monarch can be tried and executed by his own polity.
• Regicide shatters sacral kingship; the cost makes later removal (1688) procedural.
• Charles I is the regicide sovereign—the figure who made the axe fall.

Tension preserved without verdict.
