I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves the **Bank of England** (1694–present) as Anglia's **institutional template for central banking**: the chartered corporation that lent to the Crown, managed public debt, and evolved into lender of last resort—the model Hamilton invoked for the First Bank of the United States and the precedent for modern central-bank logic.

The Bank did not rule Britain.
It **financed** government borrowing and stabilized credit—and in financing, became the institutional anchor for British war capacity and imperial reach.

Where Anglia's civilizational narrative emphasizes Parliament, common law, and naval supremacy, the Bank operates through **chartered monopoly**, **public-debt management**, and **lender-of-last-resort** function—complementary to, not identical with, the British state. The structural point: British imperial power rested on the capacity to borrow; the Bank made that borrowing credible and cheap.

This file does not narrate the Bank's full institutional history.
It records how the Bank of England functions as **Anglia's central-banking archetype** in the Ferguson-derived sense: war finance as origin, public credit as legitimacy, institutional continuity as civilizational persistence.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

II. FOUNDATION: WAR FINANCE (1694)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Bank of England is chartered in 1694 to fund William III's war against France (War of the Grand Alliance / Nine Years' War).

Context:
• William III needs funds; goldsmith lenders damaged by Charles II's Stop of the Exchequer (1672)
• Scottish merchant William Paterson proposes a joint-stock company to lend £1.2 million to the government at 8%
• Parliament grants charter: "The Governor and Company of the Bank of England"
• Bank receives monopoly on note issue in London (evolving); acts as government's banker and debt manager

Niall Ferguson, in *The Ascent of Money: A Financial History of the World* (2008), treats the Bank of England as the foundational institution of modern central banking—the first durable fusion of private capital and public debt management, and the template for Hamilton's First Bank and later central banks.

SUMMARY — Ferguson, *The Ascent of Money* (ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-SECONDARY]:
> The Bank of England was not invented as an abstract idea of central banking. It was invented to fund a war. William III needed money; Parliament granted a charter to a corporation that would lend to the government and in return receive interest and privileges. That bargain—public debt in exchange for institutional stability—became the model for the modern fiscal state.
> — Niall Ferguson, *The Ascent of Money: A Financial History of the World* (New York: Penguin Press, 2008) (ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-SECONDARY]. Summary-only note: Open-web access to a verbatim text was not available at time of update.

War finance creates the institution; the institution outlasts the war.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. PUBLIC DEBT & CREDIT STABILITY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Bank's power derives from **public-debt management**: it lends to the government, issues notes, and—over time—becomes the guarantor of monetary and credit stability.

Mechanisms:
• Government borrows from the Bank; Bank holds government debt and issues notes backed by that debt
• Monopoly on joint-stock banking in England (until 1826) and on note issue in London
• Lender of last resort function emerges in the 19th century (Bagehot); the Bank stabilizes panics by lending to solvent but illiquid institutions
• Coordination with the City of London and with private houses (Rothschild, Barings) in underwriting government bonds

The structural point: Britain could sustain prolonged war and imperial expansion because it could monetize future revenue (debt) at low cost. The Bank made that debt credible. Pitt's wars, Wellington's campaigns, and the Rothschild network all rested on a **market** for British government debt; the Bank was the institutional anchor of that market. See MEM–ANGLIA–ROTHSCHILD, MEM–ANGLIA–BRITISH–EMPIRE.

Ferguson, in *The Cash Nexus: Money and Power in the Modern World, 1700–2000* (2001), emphasizes the link between fiscal capacity and military power: the Bank and the long-term bond market gave Britain a structural advantage over rivals that could not borrow as cheaply or as deeply.

IV. HAMILTON, FIRST BANK, FED: LINEAGE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Bank of England is the **institutional precedent** for the First Bank of the United States (1791) and—through that lineage—for the Federal Reserve (1913).

• **Hamilton:** Explicitly modelled the First Bank on the Bank of England—chartered corporation, public-debt management, note issue, lender of last resort logic. See MEM–ANGLIA–HAMILTON.
• **Jackson:** Destroyed the Second Bank (1830s); the United States had no central bank until the Fed. Morgan filled the void as private lender of last resort (1907). See MEM–ANGLIA–JACKSON, MEM–ANGLIA–MORGAN.
• **Federal Reserve (1913):** Paul Warburg and others imported Continental and British central-bank logic into American design. The Fed is the third central-bank moment in the United States; the Bank of England is the first in the Anglosphere. See MEM–ANGLIA–FEDERAL–RESERVE, MEM–ANGLIA–WARBURG.

The Bank of England teaches Anglia **where chartered public debt and central-bank logic began**—and where Hamilton and the Fed inherited that logic.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. ANGLIA CIVILIZATIONAL FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
For Anglia, the Bank of England encodes recurring lessons:

• **War finance creates institutions**—the Bank was founded to fund war; it outlasted the war and became the anchor of British public credit. Institutional continuity substitutes for ad hoc borrowing.
• **Public debt can be a source of strength**—when managed by a credible institution, long-term debt lowers the cost of borrowing and extends the state's capacity to fight and to project power.
• **Chartered monopoly and lender of last resort**—the Bank's privileges (note issue, government banker) were exchanged for stability; over time it assumed the role of stabilizer in panics. Private capital and public function merged in one institution.
• **Template for Hamilton and the Fed**—the First Bank of the United States and the Federal Reserve both descend, intellectually and institutionally, from the Bank of England. Anglia's central-bank model was exported to the republic and later re-imported in modified form.

The Bank of England teaches Anglia **where the fiscal-military state met the central bank**—and where that meeting became the template for Anglosphere finance.

VI. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• 1694: Charter to fund William III's war; Paterson scheme; £1.2 million loan at 8%.
• Stop of the Exchequer (1672) and goldsmith collapse as context; Crown credibility restored via Parliament and chartered corporation.
• Monopoly on joint-stock banking (England) and note issue (London); government banker and debt manager.
• 19th century: Lender of last resort (Bagehot); coordination with Rothschild and City in bond issuance.
• Hamilton's First Bank (1791) modelled on BoE; Jackson's destruction of Second Bank; Fed (1913) as third central-bank moment.
• Comparative: BoE (1694) → First Bank (1791) → Fed (1913); Warburg and Continental logic in American design.

Contradictions preserved without verdict.
