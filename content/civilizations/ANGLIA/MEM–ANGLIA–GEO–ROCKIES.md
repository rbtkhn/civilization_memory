II. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves the Rocky Mountains as **Anglia’s continental
barrier and corridor**: the terrain that defines the continental
divide, channels westward expansion, and fixes the northern limit
of American projection (49th parallel) while anchoring Canadian
continuity (British Columbia, CPR).

The Rockies are not a border; they are **where border and corridor
are decided**—by exploration, treaty, and rail.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

Stephen Ambrose (*Undaunted Courage* [1996]) centers the Lewis and Clark expedition on the crossing of the Rockies and the continental divide as the opening of the American West—terrain as obstacle and gateway (ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-SECONDARY].

SOURCE — Ambrose, *Undaunted Courage* (ARC-T-MODERN):
> Of courage undaunted, possessing a firmness and perseverance of
> purpose which nothing but impossibilities could divert from its
> direction.
> — Thomas Jefferson, on Meriwether Lewis (cited in Stephen Ambrose, *Undaunted Courage* [1996]) (ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-SECONDARY]

Ambrose frames the continental divide as the expedition’s critical phase: the point where Atlantic drainage yields to Pacific, and where Anglian (American) claim to transcontinental reach is tested.

> The Enlightenment taught that observation unrecorded was knowledge lost.
> — Stephen Ambrose, *Undaunted Courage* (1996) (ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-SECONDARY]

The Rockies thus encode **terrain as procedural threshold**: who observes, who records, who projects across the divide.

III. GEO STRUCTURED DATA (LAYER 2)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

GEOGRAPHIC PARAMETERS (REQUIRED)
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| REGION_BOUNDS | North America cordillera: Alaska to New Mexico; Anglian focus: Canadian Rockies (BC/Alberta) and US Rockies (Montana, Wyoming, Idaho, Colorado) |
| TERRAIN_TYPE | Mountain |
| CLIMATE_ZONE | Continental (alpine); temperate at lower elevations |
| KEY_FEATURES | Continental divide; South Pass (Oregon Trail); passes to Pacific drainage; 49th parallel (US–UK/Canada); mineral belts (gold, silver) |

STRATEGIC SIGNIFICANCE (REQUIRED)
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| CHOKEPOINT | No single chokepoint; multiple passes (South Pass, etc.) act as diffusion points; control of passes = projection capability |
| PROJECTION_CORRIDOR | Yes: Oregon Trail, rail corridors (CPR, US transcontinental); east–west projection depends on pass control |
| DEFENSE_BALANCE | Defense-dominant: terrain favors local resistance and constrains massed movement; offense requires securing passes |
| RESOURCE_SIGNIFICANCE | Mineral (gold, silver, later energy); fur (historical); timber; corridor value (transit) |

CONTROL SEQUENCE (REQUIRED)
| Era | Controller | Control Mode | Entry | Exit |
|-----|------------|--------------|-------|------|
| Pre–Anglian | Indigenous polities | Nomadic / Settled | — | c. 1803 |
| Early Anglian (US/UK) | US (south), UK/HBC (north) | Colonial / Contested | c. 1803 (Louisiana); 1818/1846 (boundary) | — |
| Consolidation | US (south of 49th); Canada (north) | Imperial / Settled | 1846 (Oregon); 1871 (BC); CPR 1885 | Extant |

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. STRATEGIC ANALYSIS — BARRIER AND CORRIDOR
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Rockies impose a **structural constraint** on east–west power projection.

Terrain geometry:
• Continental divide separates Atlantic (Mississippi/Missouri) from Pacific (Columbia, Colorado) drainage.
• No single pass dominates; South Pass (Wyoming) and others permit seasonal transit—not massed military movement without infrastructure.
• North–south alignment channels expansion along corridors (Oregon Trail, rail) rather than across a broad front.

Power distribution implications:
• British (Hudson’s Bay Company) and US claims overlap in Oregon Country until 1846; the Rockies anchor the **boundary question** (where does British North America end?).
• 49th parallel settlement (1818 partial; 1846 Oregon Treaty) fixes the line; the Rockies become the **spine of partition**—US to the south, British/Canadian to the north.
• Canadian Pacific Railway (1885) secures British Columbia to Canada by threading the Rockies; US transcontinental rails do the same south of the border.

Defense balance: terrain is **defense-dominant**. Offensive projection across the range requires investment in passes and rail; indigenous and later state resistance can exploit choke points and supply stretch.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. STRATEGIC ANALYSIS — OREGON, 49TH PARALLEL, AND RAIL
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Anglian relevance turns on **who controls the corridor** and **where the line is drawn**.

Oregon Country (1818–1846): joint US–UK occupation; the Rockies frame the hinterland. Settlement and the Oregon Trail push American presence west; British/HBC presence north. The **structural outcome** is partition at 49th parallel—continental divide and Rockies as shared reference, not shared territory.

Post-1846: US consolidates south of 49th (Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Montana); British North America (later Canada) consolidates north (BC). The Rockies thus encode **two Anglian polities**—revolutionary US and loyalist Canada—with the same terrain and different procedural allegiance.

Rail: Canadian Pacific and US transcontinental lines **bind territory to metropole**. The Rockies are the obstacle that, once crossed by rail, make continental states possible. Failure to secure a rail corridor through the Rockies would have left BC and the US West Coast structurally exposed.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. ARC-T-ANCIENT / ARC-T-MEDIEVAL (ANGLIAN RECORD)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
No Anglian record for the Rockies in ARC-T-ANCIENT or ARC-T-MEDIEVAL. The terrain enters Anglian strategic cognition in the early modern period (exploration, fur trade) and modern period (Lewis & Clark, Oregon, rail). Placeholder for future ARC-T-ANCIENT/MEDIEVAL sources if applicable to pre-Anglian or comparative civilizational use.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. ARC-T-EARLY-MOD (EARLY MODERN)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Fur trade (Hudson’s Bay Company, North West Company) and exploratory expeditions (e.g. Mackenzie, Lewis & Clark) establish early modern Anglian engagement with the cordillera. The Rockies function as **barrier to direct Pacific access** and **corridor for trade and claim**. Placeholder for verbatim ARC-T-EARLY-MOD quotation when source is added to CIV–ARC–ANGLIA.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VIII. CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Rockies encode **terrain as procedural threshold** and **partition spine**.

Lessons:
• Continental divide separates drainage—and, in Anglian practice, separates US from British/Canadian sphere along the 49th parallel.
• Passes and rail corridors enable projection; control of passes is a precondition for continental integration.
• The same terrain sustains two Anglian procedural outcomes: revolutionary America and loyalist Canada.

The Rockies are where Anglian westward expansion **meets its geographic limit** and where **boundary is fixed by treaty**—not erased.

• MEM–ANGLIA–GEO–PACIFIC–OCEAN (Pacific terminus of Rockies drainage; Oregon, BC)
• MEM–ANGLIA–NATIVE–AMERICANS (indigenous presence and resistance in cordillera)

Dependency: This MEM supports continental-partition and corridor-control reasoning. Breaks if removed: continuity between Ohio Valley frontier and Pacific littoral; 49th parallel as Anglian boundary.

Cross-references denote lineage, not equivalence.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
X. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• The Rockies are the continental divide and the spine of US–Canadian partition.
• Passes and rail corridors determine east–west projection; terrain is defense-dominant.
• Anglian engagement (US and British/Canadian) fixes the 49th parallel and encodes two procedural outcomes—revolutionary and loyalist—in one terrain.
• Observation and record (Ambrose: “knowledge lost”) tie legitimacy of claim to passage and documentation across the divide.

Tension preserved without verdict.
