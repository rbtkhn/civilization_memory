I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves James II as **Anglia’s Catholic-king sovereign**:
the ruler whose confessional and political choices triggered the
Glorious Revolution (1688), his own flight, and the consolidation of
Parliament’s supremacy and constitutional monarchy under William III.

James II does not invent revolution.
He **triggers** it—and in triggering, encodes the moment when a king
can be removed by invitation (William of Orange) and by parliamentary
and elite consensus, without regicide.

This file does not moralize James’s Catholicism or his policies. It
preserves *confessional rupture as legitimacy fracture*: the Catholic
king who could not hold the realm, and the Revolution of 1688 as the
structural close of absolute Stuart claims.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

II. CATHOLIC KING & CONFESSIONAL RUPTURE (PRIMARY + SECONDARY)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
James II succeeds his brother Charles II in 1685. He is openly Catholic
and pursues religious toleration and the advancement of Catholics in
army and administration. Elite and popular resistance hardens; the
birth of a Catholic heir (1688) raises the prospect of a Catholic
dynasty. William of Orange is invited to intervene; James flees;
Parliament declares the throne vacant and offers the crown to William
and Mary (1689).

Structural consequence: the **Glorious Revolution** is revolution by
invitation and procedure—no execution of the king, but his removal by
flight and by parliamentary declaration. Legitimacy is transferred by
consent of the political nation, not by battle alone.

Winston Churchill, in *A History of the English-Speaking Peoples*, Vol. 2 (*The New World* [1956]), devotes chapters to “The Catholic King” and “The Revolution of 1688,” framing James’s reign as the moment when confessional and dynastic overreach meet institutional resistance—and the Revolution of 1688 as the consolidation of Parliament’s supremacy and constitutional monarchy (ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-SECONDARY].

> Churchill’s chapters on the Catholic King and the Revolution of 1688 frame James II’s reign as the trigger for revolution by invitation—the king who could not hold the realm, and the parliamentary and elite consensus that transferred the crown to William and Mary and consolidated constitutional monarchy.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. FLIGHT & REVOLUTION BY INVITATION (PRIMARY + SECONDARY)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
James’s flight (December 1688) is not deposition by trial—it is
**removal by exit**. Parliament declares that James has “abdicated”
and that the throne is vacant; William and Mary are offered the crown
subject to the Declaration of Right (later Bill of Rights 1689). The
settlement establishes parliamentary consent as a precondition for
legitimate rule and limits the crown’s prerogative.

The structural point is that revolution can be **procedural**: no axe
falls on the king, but his authority is dissolved by flight and by
parliamentary act. Legitimacy passes to those who accept the new
constraints.

IV. CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
James II encodes **confessional rupture as legitimacy fracture** and
**revolution by invitation**. The Catholic king triggers the Glorious
Revolution; flight and parliamentary declaration replace regicide.

Lessons:
• A king’s confessional and political choices can trigger removal by elite and parliamentary consensus.
• Revolution can be procedural—flight and declaration—rather than execution.
• The Revolution of 1688 consolidates Parliament’s supremacy and constitutional monarchy.
• James II is the Stuart king who could not hold the realm—the figure who made 1688 necessary.

V. MEM CONNECTIONS (STRUCTURAL)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Internal (ANGLIA):
1) MEM–ANGLIA–DYNASTY–STUART
   — James II as last Stuart king in England; Revolution of 1688 closes Stuart absolute claims.
2) MEM–ANGLIA–WAR–ENGLISH–CIVIL
   — Contrast: regicide (Charles I) vs revolution by invitation (James II).
3) MEM–ANGLIA–LAW–PARLIAMENT
   — Bill of Rights 1689; Parliament’s supremacy consolidated after 1688.
4) MEM–ANGLIA–CHARLES–I
   — Precedent: sacral kingship broken by execution; James II removed by procedure.
5) MEM–ANGLIA–ENGLAND
   — Constitutional settlement; legitimacy by consent.

Cross-Civilizational (structural parallel):
6) MEM–FRANCIA–LOUIS–XVI
   — Contrast: flight and capture (Louis) vs flight and replacement (James); different outcomes.
