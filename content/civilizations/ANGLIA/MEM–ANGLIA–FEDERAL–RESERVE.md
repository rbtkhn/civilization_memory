I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves the **Federal Reserve System** (1913) as Anglia's third central-bank moment: the return of national monetary authority after Hamilton's First Bank (1791) and Jackson's destruction of the Second Bank (1830s).

The Fed is not Anglia's ruler.
It is Anglia's **monetary projection mechanism**—the institution that creates money, sets interest rates, and backs the dollar as the unit of account for the United States and, for a time, much of the world.

Where Anglia's civilizational narrative emphasizes Parliament, common law, and naval supremacy, the Fed operates through **credit creation**, **discount lending**, and **open-market operations**—complementary to, not identical with, the American state.

This file does not narrate Fed policy history.
It records how the Fed functions as **Anglia's central-bank return**—the outcome of the 1910 Jekyll Island meeting, the Federal Reserve Act (1913), and a century of controversy over who controls the money supply.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

II. JEKYLL ISLAND (1910): ORIGINS & CONTROVERSY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
In November 1910, a small group of bankers and Treasury officials met in secret on Jekyll Island, Georgia, to draft a plan for a central banking system in the United States.

Context:
• No central bank since Jackson destroyed the Second Bank (1830s)
• Recurring financial panics (1873, 1893, 1907)
• Aldrich Commission (1908–1912) studying monetary reform
• Demand for an "elastic" currency and a lender of last resort

Ron Chernow, in *The House of Morgan* (1990), documents J.P. Morgan's role in the **Panic of 1907**: Pierpont coordinated a private lender-of-last-resort response, convening bankers and committing capital to stabilize failing institutions and markets. That episode demonstrated the structural need for an institutional lender of last resort and helped motivate the Aldrich Commission and, later, the Jekyll Island draft and the Federal Reserve Act. Morgan's 1907 intervention was the last major private bailout before the Fed assumed the function in 1913.

G. Edward Griffin, in *The Creature from Jekyll Island: A Second Look at the Federal Reserve* (1994), treats the Jekyll Island meeting as the **birthplace** of the Fed—a private conference that produced the framework later adapted and passed by Congress as the Federal Reserve Act (1913). Mainstream historiography emphasizes the Aldrich Commission, congressional debate, and the Glass-Owen compromise; Griffin emphasizes elite coordination and private design.

SUMMARY — Griffin, *The Creature from Jekyll Island* (ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-CRITICAL]:
> The Federal Reserve System is not federal, has no reserves, and is not a system in the sense of being a public agency. It is a cartel of private banks that has been granted the privilege of creating money out of nothing and lending it to the government and the public at interest. The Jekyll Island meeting of 1910 was the birthplace of this design—a design that would have been familiar to Hamilton in purpose, if not in every mechanism.
> — G. Edward Griffin, *The Creature from Jekyll Island: A Second Look at the Federal Reserve* (Westlake Village, CA: American Media, 1994) (ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-CRITICAL]. Summary-only note: Open-web access to a verbatim text was not available at time of update.

Whether one treats Jekyll Island as decisive or merely preparatory, the structural point holds: central banking returned to the United States in 1913, completing a cycle that Hamilton began and Jackson interrupted.

III. FEDERAL RESERVE ACT (1913): STRUCTURE & FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Federal Reserve Act (December 23, 1913) established a **decentralized** central bank: twelve regional Federal Reserve Banks, a Federal Reserve Board in Washington, and a mix of public and private elements.

Mechanisms:
• Federal Reserve Banks (private member banks hold stock; Board appoints key officers)
• Federal Reserve Board (presidential appointees; public oversight)
• Monetary policy: discount lending, reserve requirements, open-market operations (later)
• Lender of last resort: provide liquidity during panics
• Elastic currency: supply money in response to demand

The design deliberately avoided the name "central bank" and the concentration of the First and Second Banks—a concession to Jacksonian memory and regional politics. The result was a **hybrid**: part public, part private; part Washington, part regional.

Griffin frames the hybrid as disguise:

> The men who met on Jekyll Island in 1910 represented the same kind of concentrated financial power that Jackson had denounced when he destroyed the Bank of the United States. They designed the Federal Reserve to serve private interests while appearing to serve the public. Jackson would have recognized the pattern—and would have opposed it.
> — G. Edward Griffin, *The Creature from Jekyll Island* (1994) (ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-CRITICAL]. Summary-only note: Open-web access to a verbatim text was not available at time of update.

Controversy over the Fed's legitimacy—public agency or private cartel—has never been resolved. Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

IV. CREDIT AS LEVERAGE (STRUCTURAL)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Fed's power derives from **monetary monopoly**: it controls the supply of base money (reserves) and, through that, the cost of credit (interest rates). The government borrows in dollars; the Fed influences how many dollars exist and how expensive they are to borrow.

Structural logic:
• Control of money supply → control of interest rates → influence over economic activity and inflation
• Lender of last resort → reduces panic risk → encourages leverage (moral hazard)
• Dollar as reserve currency (post-1945) → Fed's decisions affect the world

The fact that the Fed is not literally "the government" does not diminish its structural role—it exemplifies **delegated monetary authority**: the state grants the privilege of creating money to an institution that operates at arm's length. Hamilton would have recognized the purpose; Jackson would have questioned the legitimacy.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. ANGLIA CIVILIZATIONAL FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
For Anglia, the Federal Reserve encodes recurring lessons:

• **Central banking returned** after Jackson's Bank War—Hamilton's logic (national bank, public credit) reasserted under a new design.
• **Elite coordination and congressional passage** can coexist—whether Jekyll Island was decisive or merely preparatory, private drafting and public legislation produced the Fed.
• **Monetary authority can be delegated but not abolished**—the question is who controls it, under what rules, and with what accountability.
• **Legitimacy controversy is enduring**—Griffin's "creature" (private cartel disguised as public agency) and mainstream narrative (independent central bank serving public stability) remain in tension.

The Fed teaches Anglia **where monetary authority was re-established after populist rupture**—and where the man who controls the money supply (or the committee that does) acquires structural leverage over the state.

VI. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Jekyll Island (1910) produced a draft that influenced the Federal Reserve Act (1913).
• Fed structure: twelve regional banks, Board in Washington, hybrid public-private.
• Monetary policy: discount lending, reserve requirements, open-market operations (post-1920s).
• Lender of last resort: Fed backstops banks; reduces panic risk; creates moral hazard.
• Legitimacy controversy: "not federal, no reserves, not a system" (Griffin) vs independent central bank serving stability.
• Hamilton's national-bank idea outlives Jackson's Bank War; Fed is the third central-bank moment.

Contradictions preserved without verdict.
