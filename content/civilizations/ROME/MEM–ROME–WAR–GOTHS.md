I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves the **Goths** as Rome’s first sustained encounter
with a **non-integrable military society** operating at imperial scale:
a confederated people capable of learning Roman warfare, exploiting
imperial logistics, and surviving repeated defeat without dissolution.

The Gothic wars do not represent barbarian invasion alone.
They represent **imperial overstretch meeting adaptive resistance**.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. ORIGINS & FRONTIER CONTACT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Goths emerge in Roman sources along the lower Danube and Black Sea
during the third century AD.

They are characterized by:
• Loose confederation rather than centralized kingship
• Military mobility over civic settlement
• Opportunistic raiding combined with diplomatic engagement
• Rapid adaptation to Roman arms and tactics

Ammianus Marcellinus describes the instability of Gothic identity:

> “The Goths were not bound together by any firm or ancient compact,
> but were a turbulent multitude, following leaders according to
> circumstance, and united more by hope of plunder than by law or
> discipline, yet formidable through numbers and boldness.”  
> — Ammianus Marcellinus, *Res Gestae*, XXXI

Rome confronts not a state, but a **moving military ecology**.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. THIRD-CENTURY SHOCK & ROMAN VULNERABILITY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Gothic raids during the third century expose Roman fragility.

Features include:
• Maritime raids across the Black Sea and Aegean
• Sackings of cities previously considered secure
• Roman inability to impose decisive annihilation

Dexippus (preserved via later sources) records the shock:

> “The barbarians crossed not as fugitives but as conquerors, spreading
> terror through lands long unacquainted with war, while Roman forces,
> divided by civil discord, were unable to meet them in open battle.”  

The Gothic problem emerges during **Roman internal crisis**, not
external strength.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. THE DANUBE SYSTEM UNDER STRAIN
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Gothic wars strain Rome’s Danubian defense architecture.

Key failures:
• Overreliance on static fortifications
• Inadequate mobile field armies
• Delayed response due to internal politics

Tacitus’ warning proves prophetic:

> “It is not the frontier that is most dangerous, but the neglect of
> discipline within; for where the army is weakened by luxury or
> faction, the enemy soon appears formidable.”  
> — Tacitus, *Histories*, IV

The Goths reveal that **frontiers fail from inside first**.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. CE 376 — MASS ENTRY & POLICY FAILURE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Gothic crossing of the Danube in CE 376 marks a qualitative shift.

Causes include:
• Hunnic pressure from the steppe
• Roman manpower shortages
• Administrative corruption
• Failure of refugee integration policy

Ammianus records the moral collapse of governance:

> “The avarice of officials sold food to the starving at extortionate
> prices, and those who should have protected the Goths instead drove
> them to desperation, so that war arose from injustice rather than
> necessity.”  
> — Ammianus Marcellinus, *Res Gestae*, XXXI

This is not invasion.
It is **policy-induced rebellion**.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. ADRIANOPLE  (CE 378) — STRUCTURAL DEFEAT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Battle of Adrianople represents a decisive systemic failure.

Outcomes:
• Destruction of a Roman field army
• Death of Emperor Valens
• Collapse of deterrence logic

Ammianus captures the catastrophe:

> “The day was fatal to the Roman state, for never before had such a
> slaughter been inflicted by the barbarians, and the flower of the
> army was cut down as if by a sudden tempest.”  
> — Ammianus Marcellinus, *Res Gestae*, XXXI

Adrianople demonstrates that **Rome can no longer impose decisive
battlefield solutions**.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. SETTLEMENT WITHOUT SUBORDINATION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Post-Adrianople policy abandons annihilation.

Rome adopts:
• Federate settlements
• Autonomous Gothic military units
• Legal ambiguity regarding sovereignty

Edward Gibbon observes:

> “The Goths were admitted as allies rather than subjects, and the
> empire purchased peace by concessions which diminished authority and
> established a precedent more fatal than defeat.”  
> — Edward Gibbon, *Decline and Fall*, Chapter XXVI

Rome survives tactically—but yields strategically.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VIII. PUBLIC DOMAIN SCHOLARSHIP — STRUCTURAL DIAGNOSIS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Mommsen frames the Gothic wars as systemic:

> “The Gothic wars revealed that the Roman state had outgrown the
> administrative and military forms of the principate, and that
> frontier defense required reforms which arrived too late.”  
> — Theodor Mommsen, *The Provinces of the Roman Empire*

The war exposes mismatch between **imperial scale and imperial tools**.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IX. MODERN SCHOLARSHIP — ADAPTIVE ENEMY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Peter Heather emphasizes learning dynamics:

> “The Goths did not defeat Rome by overwhelming force, but by learning
> how Roman power worked and where it could no longer respond quickly
> or coherently.”  
> — Peter Heather, *The Fall of the Roman Empire*

Anthony Kaldellis stresses state choice:

> “What failed in the Gothic wars was not Roman courage, but Roman
> governance—especially the capacity to regulate force within its own
> borders.”  
> — Anthony Kaldellis, *The New Roman Empire*

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
X. CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Gothic wars encode **adaptive resistance under imperial fatigue**.

Lessons preserved:
• Confederations outlast victories
• Administrative injustice creates enemies
• Frontier collapse follows internal failure
• Settlement can stabilize without restoring authority
• Rome begins to govern by accommodation

The Goths are Rome’s first mirror.
