GEO–MEM COGNITIVE DECLARATION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file integrates Mearsheimer structural-realist analysis with
Mercouris recursive reasoning per CIV–MIND architecture.

Proportional blend: 2/3 Mearsheimer (strategic logic) + 1/3 Mercouris
(ARC-sourced temporal recursion).

Iberia is analyzed as Rome's western consolidation success: depth
without centrality, extraction without strategic weight.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves Iberia as **Rome's peripheral proof-of-concept**:
a space where prolonged conquest, deep Romanization, and sustained
resource extraction produced durable provincial success—yet one that
exited Roman control with minimal strategic shock.

For Rome, Iberia is **depth without centrality**.

Central thesis: Successful provinces need not be strategically decisive.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. MEARSHEIMER STRATEGIC ANALYSIS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

II.A — STOPPING POWER OF TERRAIN

Iberian terrain initially impedes Roman conquest but subsequently
enables stable provincial organization. Mountain interiors and
tribal compartmentalization slow initial penetration but cannot
prevent systematic absorption.

Geographic characteristics:
• Meseta (central plateau) divides peninsula
• Coastal corridors enable Mediterranean access
• Pyrenees separate Iberia from Gallic pressure
• Atlantic exposure provides western strategic depth

Once conquered, terrain isolation works for Rome: Iberia cannot
easily export instability. What slows conquest also slows collapse.

II.B — REGIONAL HEGEMONY DYNAMICS

Roman hegemony in Iberia succeeds through generational persistence.
Unlike eastern provinces (rapid Hellenistic inheritance), Iberia
requires 200 years of conquest (218 BC – 19 BC). This investment
produces deeper integration.

Hegemony achieved through:
• Urban network construction (Emerita Augusta, Tarraco, Corduba)
• Latin linguistic dominance
• Elite co-optation and citizenship extension
• Imperial career access for provincial aristocrats

Result: Iberia produces emperors (Trajan, Hadrian) yet remains
strategically peripheral. Integration succeeds; centrality does not.

II.C — OFFENSIVE/DEFENSIVE TERRAIN BALANCE

Iberian terrain heavily favors defenders during conquest phase but
becomes irrelevant post-pacification. Mountain warfare benefits
Celtiberian and Lusitanian resistance; once subdued, same terrain
inhibits reconstitution of opposition.

Defensive terrain enables:
• Prolonged tribal resistance (Numantine Wars, Viriathus)
• Generational Roman commitment requirement
• Complete pacification once achieved

Post-conquest, terrain provides **insulation** rather than either
offensive or defensive advantage. Iberia neither threatens Rome
nor requires constant defense.

II.D — POWER PROJECTION CORRIDORS

Iberia's corridors are internal rather than connective. Unlike the
Levant (which connects multiple regions), Iberia terminates at
Atlantic. Roman power projects into Iberia but not through it.

Key corridors:
• Via Augusta (Mediterranean coastal route)
• Ebro valley (northeastern access)
• Guadalquivir valley (southern heartland access)
• Atlantic coastal routes (later development)

Terminal geography means: Iberia receives Roman power but does not
redistribute it. Peripheral location = reduced corridor significance.

II.E — STRATEGIC DEPTH

Iberia provides western strategic depth of minimal utility. Unlike
eastern depth (buffering Persia) or northern depth (buffering
Germanic tribes), western depth faces only Atlantic.

Strategic depth calculus:
• No significant peer competitors to west
• Pyrenees provide natural buffer from Gaul
• Distance from crisis zones reduces strategic relevance
• Resources extractable without strategic investment

Iberia is depth without purpose—valuable for what it produces,
not what it protects against.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. DOCTRINE APPLICATION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
DOCTRINE 08 — Absorption Prevents Fragmentation
Iberia demonstrates successful absorption: complete cultural
integration, elite alignment, institutional adoption. Romanization
so deep that post-Roman successor kingdoms retain Latin language
and Roman law.

DOCTRINE 10 — Institutional Learning
Rome learns from Iberian conquest that persistence defeats
resistance. Generational commitment (200 years) teaches that
some provinces require endurance, not genius. This institutional
patience becomes replicable methodology.

IV. ARC TIMELINE — IBERIA
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

ARC-T-ANCIENT — Pre-500 AD
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Polybius emphasizes conquest duration and cost:

> "The war in Iberia differed from most others in this respect, that it
> was not decided by a few battles or within a short time, but was
> protracted through many years, owing to the courage of the natives,
> the difficult nature of the country, and the necessity under which
> the Romans found themselves of fighting tribe after tribe as each
> in turn resisted subjugation."
> — Polybius, *Histories*, Book III

Strabo highlights transformation depth:

> "The Turdetanians are regarded as the most civilized of the Iberians,
> and they possess a written literature and laws in verse of great
> antiquity. The rest, too, are now for the most part Romans in habits,
> having adopted the Latin language and mode of life, and even the
> organization of cities."
> — Strabo, *Geography*, Book III

Pliny the Elder on extraction scale:

> "Nowhere does the earth produce more silver than in Spain, nor is it
> yielded in greater abundance or with more lasting profit. The veins
> extend for many miles, and the labor of the miners never ceases, so
> that the revenues drawn from Spain form one of the chief supports of
> the Roman treasury."
> — Pliny the Elder, *Natural History*, Book XXXIII

Tacitus on elite integration:

> "The provinces of Spain, long accustomed to obedience and softened by
> prosperity, supplied Rome not only with soldiers and revenues but with
> men trained in civil administration and public life, so that loyalty
> was secured less by force than by participation in power."
> — Tacitus, *Histories*, Book I

ARC-T-MEDIEVAL — 500–1500 AD
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Gibbon contrasts Iberia's quiet exit with frontier collapse:

> "The loss of Spain was scarcely felt in the decline of the Roman
> Empire. Remote from the great line of invasion, and exhausted rather
> than defended by the efforts of the government, the peninsula passed
> almost insensibly under the dominion of the Barbarians."
> — Gibbon, *Decline and Fall*, Chapter XXXI

Visigothic succession maintains Roman institutional grammar. Law
codes preserve Latin legal tradition; Church maintains Roman
administrative structures. Exit without rupture.

ARC-T-EARLY-MOD — 1500–1800 AD
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Mommsen frames strategic asymmetry:

> "The western provinces, and Spain above all, lay outside the decisive
> strategic theatre of the Empire. Their loss was serious in revenue and
> prestige, but it did not strike at the military heart of Roman power
> as did the disasters along the Danube and in the Balkan lands."
> — Mommsen, *History of Rome*, Book V

Iberia's Reconquista produces kingdoms that consciously invoke Roman
heritage. Medieval Spanish identity incorporates Roman memory as
foundation layer.

ARC-T-MODERN — 1800–Present
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Heather observes integration depth:

> "Roman Spain was among the most thoroughly integrated of the western
> provinces, but its distance from the empire's main strategic fronts
> meant that its fate was rarely decisive for the survival of Roman
> power as a whole."
> — Peter Heather, *The Fall of the Roman Empire*

Goldsworthy on affordability of loss:

> "Spain was a success story of Roman rule, yet its very success made it
> less central to imperial crisis management. The empire could afford to
> lose Spain in a way it could never afford to lose Italy or the Balkans."
> — Adrian Goldsworthy, *How Rome Fell*

VI. CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Iberia encodes **success without centrality**.

Lessons preserved:
• Romanization can succeed completely
• Peripheral depth ≠ strategic importance
• Extraction zones stabilize without steering
• Not all territorial losses are fatal
• Quiet exits signal successful integration
• Cultural absorption outlasts political control

Iberia strengthens Rome without defining it.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Iberia proves Rome's provincial methodology
• Persistence defeats resistance over generations
• Integration depth correlates with exit grace
• Peripheral success ≠ strategic control
• Rome at its most competent is least exposed
• What Rome builds survives Rome's departure

Tension preserved without verdict.
