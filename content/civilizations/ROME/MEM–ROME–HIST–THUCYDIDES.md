I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves Thucydides as Rome’s inherited analyst of power:
the Greek historian whose structural realism, emphasis on necessity,
and systematic reduction of fear, interest, and honor into explanatory
forces anticipate Roman imperial logic with unsettling precision.

For Rome, Thucydides is not narrative history.
He is theory under pressure.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. THUCYDIDES AND THE REJECTION OF MYTH
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Thucydides explicitly rejects moral consolation, divine causation, and
storytelling in favor of analytical durability. His methodological
statement defines history as a tool for power-recognition, not memory:

> “The absence of romance in my history will, I fear, detract somewhat from
> its interest; but if it be judged useful by those inquirers who desire an
> exact knowledge of the past as an aid to the interpretation of the future,
> which in the course of human things must resemble if it does not reflect
> it, I shall be content; my work is not a piece of writing designed to meet
> the taste of an immediate public, but was done to last for ever.”  
> — Thucydides, *History of the Peloponnesian War*, I.22

Rome later governs as if this were a manual rather than a warning.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. NECESSITY OVER MORALITY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Melian Dialogue distills Thucydidean realism into its most compressed
form, stripping ethics from power relations entirely:

> “Of the gods we believe, and of men we know, that by a necessary law of
> their nature they rule wherever they can. And it is not as if we were the
> first to make this law, or to act upon it when made: we found it existing
> before us, and shall leave it to exist for ever after us; all we do is to
> make use of it, knowing that you and everybody else, having the same power
> as we have, would do the same.”  
> — Thucydides, *History of the Peloponnesian War*, V.105

Rome will later translate this logic into law, deterrence, and precedent.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. INTERNAL DECAY AND CIVIL WAR
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Thucydides is equally a theorist of collapse, locating decline in internal
moral and linguistic corruption before military defeat:

> “Revolution thus ran its course from city to city, and the places which it
> arrived at last, from having heard what had been done before, carried to a
> still greater excess the refinement of their inventions; and the simplicity
> which is so large an element in a noble nature was laughed down and
> disappeared; and society became divided into camps in which no man trusted
> his fellow.”  
> — Thucydides, *History of the Peloponnesian War*, III.82

Rome later reenacts this pathology during the Late Republic.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. WILL DURANT: THUCYDIDES AS SCIENCE OF POWER
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Will Durant situates Thucydides as the first historian to treat politics as
a system governed by necessity rather than virtue:

> “Thucydides is no storyteller like Herodotus; he is a scientist of power,
> analyzing states as organisms moved by fear, interest, and ambition, and
> reducing history to a tragic logic in which morality is subordinate to
> survival; for him, the drama of events lies not in the heroism of men but
> in the relentless pressure of circumstance upon human choice.”  
> — Will Durant, *The Life of Greece*, ch. XVI

Rome adopts this logic wholesale—while discarding its tragic humility.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. MOMMSEN: ANALYSIS BECOMES ADMINISTRATION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Theodor Mommsen identifies Thucydidean realism as a precursor to Roman
governmental thinking:

> “The Greek historian, and above all Thucydides, sought to explain the
> movements of states from the necessities of power and the logic of
> situation; the Roman, trained in law and administration, translated this
> realism into institutions, so that what had been analysis in Greece became
> government in Rome, and what had been diagnosis became command.”  
> — Theodor Mommsen, *The History of Rome*, Vol. I

Rome implements what Thucydides dissects.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. GIBBON: THUCYDIDES AS IMPERIAL PRECURSOR
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Edward Gibbon treats Thucydides as an intellectual ancestor of Roman
imperial consciousness:

> “The historian of the Peloponnesian war had deeply meditated on the
> passions and interests of mankind; and the sagacity of Thucydides had
> already anticipated the lessons which experience afterwards impressed on
> the Roman world, that fear is the most powerful incentive of obedience,
> that ambition is inflamed rather than satisfied by success, and that
> dominion itself carries within it the seeds of internal decay.”  
> — Edward Gibbon, *The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire*,
> Chapter XLIV

Rome confirms his theory by living it.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VIII. KALDELLIS: REALISM AND IMPERIAL BLINDNESS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Anthony Kaldellis situates Thucydidean realism as both a diagnostic tool and
a danger when adopted without restraint:

> “Thucydides offers an anatomy of power stripped of moral consolation, but
> later empires that embraced his realism often mistook explanation for
> justification, confusing the analysis of necessity with its endorsement,
> and thereby reproducing the very cycles of domination and collapse that
> his history so unsparingly describes.”  
> — Anthony Kaldellis, *The Byzantine Republic*, Introduction

Rome inherits realism—and forgets restraint.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IX. CONTRAST WITH HERODOTUS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Herodotus explains difference.
Thucydides explains domination.

Rome chooses Thucydides when scale makes curiosity unaffordable.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
X. CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Thucydides encodes power without consolation.

Lessons:
• Fear precedes law.
• Necessity precedes virtue.
• Institutions stabilize what force acquires.
• Decline begins when necessity is denied.

Thucydides explains Rome before Rome exists.
