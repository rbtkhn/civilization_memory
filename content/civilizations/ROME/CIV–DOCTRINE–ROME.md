II. DOCTRINE REGISTRY (AUTHORITATIVE)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
FOUNDING DOCTRINES (v1.0)
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

DOCTRINE 01
Name: INSTITUTIONAL ABSORPTION OF SHOCK
Status: ACCEPTED · LOCKED · CANONICAL
Source: CIV–SCHOLAR–ROME (SYNTHESIS 0009)

Definition:
Rome survives crises by absorbing military defeat, political rupture,
and social stress into institutional continuity rather than treating
loss as delegitimizing failure.

Operational Meaning:
• Defeat is processed, not denied
• Institutions outlive commanders
• Continuity is prioritized over vindication

Hard Constraints:
• Absorption requires functioning institutions
• Repeated shocks without reform accumulate brittleness
• Institutional inertia can mask long-term decay

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

DOCTRINE 02
Name: AUTHORITY TRANSLATION OVER RESTORATION
Status: ACCEPTED · LOCKED · CANONICAL
Source: CIV–SCHOLAR–ROME (SYNTHESIS 0001)

Definition:
When Roman authority collapses in one form, it is translated into
another domain (legal, religious, administrative) rather than
restored in its original configuration.

Operational Meaning:
• Power migrates instead of disappearing
• Legitimacy shifts venue rather than vanishing
• Survival depends on adaptability of form

Hard Constraints:
• Translation requires recognized continuity symbols
• Excessive translation weakens original institutions
• Loss of shared legitimacy grammar halts transfer

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

DOCTRINE 03
Name: MARITIME COHERENCE AS IMPERIAL STABILITY
Status: ACCEPTED · LOCKED · CANONICAL
Source: CIV–SCHOLAR–ROME (SYNTHESIS 0005)

Definition:
Rome achieves durability through control of circulatory systems
(seas, ports, routes) rather than permanent dominance of extended
land frontiers.

Operational Meaning:
• Seas unify faster than roads
• Law and logistics scale through circulation
• Maritime interiors outperform territorial edges

Hard Constraints:
• Loss of circulation fragments authority
• Land overextension erodes replacement capacity
• Maritime systems fail if political unity fractures

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

DOCTRINE 04
Name: ADMINISTRATION PRECEDES IDEOLOGY
Status: ACCEPTED · LOCKED · CANONICAL
Source: CIV–SCHOLAR–ROME (SYNTHESIS 0006)

Definition:
Roman endurance depends on administrative regularity and legal
predictability more than moral narrative or ideological coherence.

Operational Meaning:
• Bureaucracy sustains what conquest creates
• Law substitutes for charisma
• Inclusion stabilizes diversity

Hard Constraints:
• Administration without legitimacy becomes brittle
• Excess complexity slows response
• Bureaucratic capture undermines trust

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

DOCTRINE 05
Name: EXPANSION CEILING AWARENESS
Status: ACCEPTED · LOCKED · CANONICAL
Source: CIV–SCHOLAR–ROME (SYNTHESIS 0008)

Definition:
Rome reaches maximum strength when it recognizes and respects
its expansion ceiling, shifting from territorial growth to
maintenance intelligence.

Operational Meaning:
• Consolidation follows conquest
• Borders are hardened, not chased
• Durability replaces glory

Hard Constraints:
• Political culture may demand expansion
• Overextension accelerates legitimacy loss
• Maintenance requires elite discipline

══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PHASE II DOCTRINES (v2.0)
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

DOCTRINE 06
Name: VACANCY BY DECLINATION
Status: ACCEPTED · LOCKED · CANONICAL
Source: CIV–SCHOLAR–ROME (SYNTHESIS 0029) + RLL–ROME–0002

Definition:
Authority becomes genuinely vacant not through absence of claimants
but through the possessor's refusal to claim. When those with
structural power to hold a title decline it, the title becomes
available to competitors who lack structural basis.

Operational Meaning:
• Possession without claim creates vacancy
• Declination enables fragment competition
• Structural power and titular claim are separable

Hard Constraints:
• Vacancy requires a declined claim, not mere absence
• Competing claims require the declination to be recognized
• False claims cannot fill genuine vacancy

Historical Instance:
Ottoman possession of Constantinople (1453) with declination of
full Roman succession enabled Moscow, Papacy, and HRE to maintain
competing claims.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

DOCTRINE 07
Name: FRAGMENT INHERITANCE
Status: ACCEPTED · LOCKED · CANONICAL
Source: CIV–SCHOLAR–ROME (SYNTHESIS 0018–0021) + RLL–ROME–0006

Definition:
Universal authority cannot be wholly inherited after collapse.
Multiple claimants will each hold fragments of the original
authority and claim the rest, producing permanent rivalry rather
than clean succession.

Operational Meaning:
• Collapse produces fragments, not successors
• Each fragment claims universality
• No fragment can absorb all others
• Rivalry is structural, not resolvable

Hard Constraints:
• Fragment pattern requires genuine collapse (not mere transition)
• Fragments must hold some structural basis for claim
• Total annihilation (Carthage) prevents fragment pattern

Historical Instances:
• Alexander → Diadochi (323 BC)
• Rome → Papacy/Constantinople bifurcation (395–600 AD)
• Constantinople → Four-way rivalry (1453)

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

DOCTRINE 08
Name: ABSORPTION PREVENTS FRAGMENTATION
Status: ACCEPTED · LOCKED · CANONICAL
Source: CIV–SCHOLAR–ROME (SYNTHESIS 0027)

Definition:
Empires that absorb conquered peoples through citizenship pathways
prevent fragmentation by creating stakeholders rather than subjects.
Absorption converts potential rivals into defenders.

Operational Meaning:
• Citizens defend their own status
• Subjects require defense by others
• Inclusion is cheaper than occupation
• Stakeholders identify with the center

Hard Constraints:
• Absorption requires citizenship pathways
• Some enemies cannot be absorbed (civilizational incompatibility)
• Absorption dilutes original identity over time

Historical Instance:
Roman Italian confederation held during Hannibal's invasion because
allies had citizenship pathways; Carthaginian allies defected because
they were mercenaries or subjects.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

DOCTRINE 09
Name: SYSTEMS DEFEAT GENIUS
Status: ACCEPTED · LOCKED · CANONICAL
Source: CIV–SCHOLAR–ROME (SYNTHESIS 0031)

Definition:
Institutional depth prevails over individual brilliance in prolonged
conflict. Tactical genius cannot compensate for structural weakness;
replacement capacity defeats operational excellence.

Operational Meaning:
• Systems replace losses; genius cannot
• Time favors the institutionally deeper party
• Tactical annihilation is not strategic victory
• Attrition is a strategic choice, not a failure

Hard Constraints:
• Systems require time to manifest advantage
• Catastrophic early defeat can preclude systemic response
• Genius can accelerate outcomes within structural limits

Historical Instance:
Hannibal killed more Romans than any other enemy yet lost the war
because Rome could replace Cannae three times; Carthage could not
replace Zama once.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

DOCTRINE 10
Name: INSTITUTIONAL LEARNING
Status: ACCEPTED · LOCKED · CANONICAL
Source: CIV–SCHOLAR–ROME (SYNTHESIS 0032)

Definition:
Rome survives by copying, standardizing, and multiplying foreign
capabilities rather than inventing new ones. Encounter foreign
competence → copy it → standardize it → multiply it → deploy at scale.

Operational Meaning:
• Imitation is faster than invention
• Standardization enables scaling
• Discipline substitutes for expertise
• Multiplication overwhelms specialization

Hard Constraints:
• Copying requires recognizing what to copy
• Standardization loses edge cases
• Multiplication requires institutional capacity

Historical Instance:
Rome built its first navy by reverse-engineering a captured
Carthaginian quinquereme, trained crews on land, and produced
100 ships in 60 days.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

DOCTRINE 11
Name: ANNIHILATION PREVENTS INHERITANCE
Status: ACCEPTED · LOCKED · CANONICAL
Source: CIV–SCHOLAR–ROME (SYNTHESIS 0030)

Definition:
Total destruction of a rival closes the vacancy before it opens.
Unlike defeated enemies who can be absorbed, annihilated enemies
leave no fragments, no claimants, no inheritance competition.

Operational Meaning:
• Annihilation is vacancy prevention
• Absorption leaves identity intact; annihilation does not
• Preventive destruction eliminates future risk
• Erasure secures memory monopoly

Hard Constraints:
• Annihilation is irreversible
• Annihilation is morally corrosive
• Annihilation creates demonstration effect (both deterrent and horror)
• Most enemies should be absorbed, not annihilated

Historical Instance:
Carthage was destroyed (146 BC) rather than absorbed, preventing
any fragment competition. Rome could do to Carthage what the
Ottomans declined to do to Constantinople.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

DOCTRINE 12
Name: SELECTIVE ABSORPTION
Status: ACCEPTED · LOCKED · CANONICAL
Source: CIV–SCHOLAR–ROME (SYNTHESIS 0035)

Definition:
Rome survives by absorbing foreign ideas selectively — taking what
strengthens while rejecting what destabilizes. Philosophy, religion,
and culture are filtered through pragmatic evaluation.

Operational Meaning:
• Absorb ethics, reject political absolutism
• Absorb techniques, reject dependencies
• Absorb symbols, reject incompatible structures
• Absorption is active choice, not passive reception

Hard Constraints:
• Selective absorption requires judgment capacity
• Over-absorption erodes original identity
• Under-absorption loses competitive advantage
• Some ideas resist selective extraction

Historical Instance:
Rome absorbed Plato's ethics (virtue, duty, natural law) while
rejecting his politics (philosopher-kings, class immobility).
Plato became metaphysical capital, not political code.
