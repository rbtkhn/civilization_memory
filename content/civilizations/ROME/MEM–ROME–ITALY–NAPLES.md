I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves the Kingdom of Naples as **Italy's monarchical
counterweight**: the southern kingdom that remained royal while the
north fragmented into republics and principalities.

Naples was never a republic.
Naples was never free of foreign kings.
Naples was **Italy's permanent monarchy**.

Where Florence, Venice, and Milan experimented with self-governance,
Naples endured — under Angevins, Aragonese, and finally Spanish
Habsburgs.

The Italian Wars began here.
Italian independence ended here.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

II. NORMAN AND HOHENSTAUFEN FOUNDATIONS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Kingdom of Naples originated as part of the Norman Kingdom
of Sicily (1130–1194).

Norman contributions:
• Unified southern Italy and Sicily under one crown
• Created administrative and legal infrastructure
• Established feudal monarchy with centralized tendencies

Frederick II Hohenstaufen (r. 1220–1250) made the kingdom a
center of culture and bureaucracy — the *Stupor Mundi* ruled
from the south.

After the Hohenstaufen collapse, the papacy invited Charles of
Anjou to destroy the remaining heirs (1266).

Naples and Sicily became Angevin.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. ANGEVIN NAPLES (1266–1442)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Charles I of Anjou conquered southern Italy (1266) and executed
the last Hohenstaufen claimant, Conradin (1268).

Angevin characteristics:
• French dynasty ruling Italian subjects
• Papal alliance (the kingdom was a papal fief)
• Naples became capital (previously Palermo)
• Feudal magnate power remained strong

The Sicilian Vespers (1282):
• Popular uprising against Angevin rule in Sicily
• Sicily passed to Aragon
• Naples and Sicily separated for centuries

Will Durant notes:

> "The Sicilian Vespers was one of history's most successful
> revolts — in a single evening, French rule in Sicily was
> destroyed. Henceforth Naples and Sicily would be separate
> kingdoms, though both coveted by every power in Europe."
> — Will Durant, *The Renaissance*

Naples remained Angevin.
Sicily became Aragonese.
This split defined southern Italian politics for two centuries.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. ARAGONESE NAPLES (1442–1501)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Alfonso V of Aragon ("the Magnanimous") conquered Naples in 1442.

Alfonso's achievements:
• Reunited Naples and Sicily under one ruler
• Established a brilliant Renaissance court
• Patronized humanists (including Lorenzo Valla)
• Built the Castel Nuovo triumphal arch

Alfonso made Naples his primary residence, preferring it to Spain.

Upon his death (1458), the kingdoms split again:
• Sicily returned to the Aragonese crown
• Naples passed to Alfonso's illegitimate son Ferrante I

Ferrante I (r. 1458–1494):
• Ruthless but effective ruler
• Crushed the Barons' Revolt (1485–1486)
• Maintained Neapolitan independence against papal and French claims

Durant observes:

> "Ferrante was feared rather than loved. He collected his enemies
> as other princes collected art — and displayed them embalmed in
> his palace. But he kept Naples independent when that was no
> small achievement."
> — Will Durant, *The Renaissance*

The Aragonese period was Naples' Renaissance moment.
But it was brief.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. THE FRENCH INVASION (1494–1495)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
When Ferrante I died in January 1494, French King Charles VIII
saw his opportunity.

French claim:
• Charles VIII inherited Angevin claims to Naples
• Ludovico Sforza of Milan invited French intervention
• The papacy initially permitted passage

The invasion:
• Charles crossed the Alps with 25,000 men
• Florence capitulated (Piero de' Medici's shame)
• Rome submitted
• Alfonso II of Naples abdicated in panic
• Charles entered Naples on February 22, 1495

But the conquest was hollow:
• The League of Venice formed against France
• Charles retreated, fighting his way out at Fornovo
• Naples returned to Aragonese rule

The invasion proved:
• Italian states could not resist coordinated foreign power
• Italy was a prize, not a player
• The Italian Wars had begun

See: MEM–ROME–ITALY–WAR–ITALIAN–WARS

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. SPANISH VICEROYALTY (1504–1707)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
By 1504, Ferdinand of Aragon had secured Naples permanently.

The Treaty of Granada (1500) had partitioned Naples between
France and Spain; by 1504, Spain controlled everything.

Naples under Spanish viceroys:
• Ruled from Madrid, administered locally
• Heavy taxation for Spanish imperial wars
• Suppression of baronial autonomy
• Integration into Habsburg Mediterranean system

Naples became a Spanish province.
It remained so for two centuries.

Machiavelli's verdict:

> "The Kingdom of Naples is an example of what happens when a
> prince relies on mercenaries and foreign arms. The Neapolitans
> have been conquered so many times that they seem destined to
> be ruled by others."
> — Machiavelli, *The Prince*, ch. 12 (paraphrase of argument)

Naples lost its kings.
Naples lost its independence.
Naples kept its city, its culture, and its resentments.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. NAPLES AS RENAISSANCE COURT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Despite — or because of — dynastic instability, Naples was a
major Renaissance center.

Cultural contributions:
• Alfonso the Magnanimous' humanist court
• Lorenzo Valla's philological work
• Giovanni Pontano's Neapolitan Academy
• Boccaccio's formative years (1327–1340)

Naples offered what Florence could not:
• Royal patronage (not republican or mercantile)
• Courtly culture with feudal hierarchies
• French and Spanish influences alongside Italian

Boccaccio's Naples shaped his early works and his social vision.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VIII. MEARSHEIMER SHARPENING
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Structural analysis:

**What Naples reveals:**
• Southern Italy could not generate indigenous dynasties
• Foreign rulers (French, Spanish) dominated because local power
  was fragmented among feudal barons
• Papal suzerainty complicated sovereignty — Naples was always
  a fief, never fully sovereign
• Geographic position made Naples contestable by all Mediterranean powers

**What Naples conceals:**
• The kingdom was wealthy (grain, trade, population)
• It should have been a great power
• Its failure was political, not material

Naples proves that **wealth without political coherence invites conquest**.
The barons were too strong; the crown was too contested; the papacy
was too intrusive.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IX. THE TRIGGER OF THE ITALIAN WARS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Naples' dynastic instability triggered Italy's destruction.

Sequence:
1. Ferrante I dies (1494)
2. Charles VIII claims the throne
3. Ludovico Sforza invites France to distract from his own usurpation
4. Charles invades
5. Italy becomes a battlefield for France and Spain

For 65 years (1494–1559), foreign armies ravaged Italy.

The Italian Wars ended with Spanish hegemony:
• Milan under Spain
• Naples under Spain
• Florence under Medici dukes (Spanish clients)
• Only Venice remained independent

Naples was the casus belli.
Naples was also the prize.
Naples symbolizes Italian vulnerability.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
X. CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Naples encodes **monarchy as Italian alternative**.

Lessons:
• Not all of Italy was republican
• Foreign kings are the price of baronial fragmentation
• Renaissance culture can flourish under monarchy
• Southern Italy follows a different political logic
• The Italian Wars began over Naples

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
XI. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Naples was always ruled by foreigners — Normans, Germans,
  French, Aragonese, Spanish.
• The barons prevented royal consolidation.
• The papacy claimed suzerainty and intervened constantly.
• Naples' wealth made it a target, not a power.
• The Sicilian Vespers created two kingdoms where one might
  have been strong.

Tension preserved without verdict.
