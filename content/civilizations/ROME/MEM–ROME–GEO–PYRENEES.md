GEO–MEM COGNITIVE DECLARATION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file integrates Mearsheimer structural-realist analysis with
Mercouris recursive reasoning per CIV–MIND architecture.

Proportional blend: 2/3 Mearsheimer (strategic logic) + 1/3 Mercouris
(ARC-sourced temporal recursion).

The Pyrenees are analyzed as civilizational filter: modulating
transmission between Gaul and Iberia, enabling parallel Roman
developments rather than unified western integration.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves the Pyrenees as a **civilizational filter rather
than frontier**: the mountain system that structured Rome's western
limits, shaped differential Romanization between Gaul and Hispania,
and channeled post-Roman continuity into distinct trajectories.

The Pyrenees do not stop civilization.
They **modulate its transmission**.

Central thesis: Barriers that slow also preserve.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. MEARSHEIMER STRATEGIC ANALYSIS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

II.A — STOPPING POWER OF TERRAIN

The Pyrenees present moderate stopping power—less than Alps, more
than river barriers. Dense east-west mountain wall with limited
passes creates **selective permeability**.

Terrain characteristics:
• High relief across 430 km east-west extent
• Limited major passes (Roncevaux, Somport, La Jonquera)
• Climatic and ecological discontinuity
• Difficult large-scale troop movement
• Predictable transit corridors

Unlike rivers (which invite penetration), mountains require
**intentional crossing**. This makes Pyrenees civilizational
regulator rather than open conduit.

II.B — REGIONAL HEGEMONY DYNAMICS

Roman hegemony develops separately on each side of the Pyrenees.
The mountains prevent unified western hegemony while enabling
parallel Roman systems.

Hegemony differentiation:
• Hispania: conquered from Mediterranean/Atlantic coasts, not through mountains
• Gaul: oriented toward Rhine and Alpine systems
• Limited administrative integration across range
• Separate provincial theaters with mountain buffer

Result: **parallel Roman worlds** rather than single western unit.
Each region Romanizes deeply but differently.

II.C — OFFENSIVE/DEFENSIVE TERRAIN BALANCE

Pyrenean terrain favors defense through channelization. Armies must
funnel through predictable passes; defenders concentrate at known
chokepoints.

Balance dynamics:
• Pass control enables disproportionate defense
• Mountain terrain nullifies numerical advantage
• Seasonal constraints limit campaign windows
• Siege of passes simpler than open-field defense

For Rome, this balance means: Iberia protected from Gallic spillover;
Gaul protected from Iberian complications. The barrier works both
directions.

II.D — POWER PROJECTION CORRIDORS

Pyrenean corridors are few and controlled. Unlike open terrain
(which permits distributed movement), mountains concentrate transit
into specific passes.

Key corridors:
• Eastern coastal route (La Jonquera/Perthus Pass)
• Central Somport Pass
• Western Roncevaux Pass

Roman conquest of Hispania avoids mass Pyrenean penetration, preferring
coastal and Atlantic approaches. Mountains crossed strategically,
not continuously. This reinforces provincial differentiation.

II.E — STRATEGIC DEPTH

The Pyrenees provide mutual strategic depth for both Gaul and Hispania.
Each region buffered from the other's instabilities.

Depth function:
• Gallic crises do not immediately threaten Hispania
• Iberian tribal wars contained south of mountains
• Shock transmission reduced in both directions
• Late imperial migrations delayed, not prevented

When crossings occur (Suebi, Vandals, Visigoths), they are event-driven
rather than continuous. This allows Iberia to absorb transition with
less systemic collapse.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. DOCTRINE APPLICATION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
DOCTRINE 10 — Institutional Learning
Rome learns that mountain barriers enable differentiated provincial
development. Rather than forcing integration across difficult terrain,
Rome accepts parallel systems. This institutional wisdom—accepting
geographic constraints rather than fighting them—produces stable
separate administrations.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. ARC TIMELINE — PYRENEES
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

ARC-T-ANCIENT — Pre-500 AD
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Strabo describes the barrier function:

> "The Pyrenees extend from the Mediterranean to the northern sea, and
> form a continuous wall between the Iberians and the Celts, crossed
> only at certain points where the mountains are lower and passable."
> — Strabo, *Geography*, Book III

Livy records Hannibal's crossing as exceptional achievement:

> "Hannibal led his army through the Pyrenees, a feat which required
> both the subjugation of the mountain tribes and the securing of
> passages, so that the crossing was achieved not by main force but
> by negotiation and the distribution of gifts."
> — Livy, *Ab Urbe Condita*, Book XXI

Pliny emphasizes the barrier's civilizational significance:

> "The Pyrenees separate the Spains from the Gauls, projecting their
> capes into two seas, and forming a boundary which nature herself
> has established between nations of different character."
> — Pliny the Elder, *Natural History*, Book III

ARC-T-MEDIEVAL — 500–1500 AD
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Pyrenees channel post-Roman transitions. Visigothic Spain and
Frankish Gaul develop as separate successor kingdoms. Carolingian
expansion stops at or just beyond the mountains (Spanish March).

Gibbon observes barrier persistence:

> "The Pyrenees, which had separated the Roman provinces, now divided
> the kingdoms of the Franks and the Visigoths; and the mountains
> preserved their ancient office of marking the boundary between
> distinct nations and polities."
> — Gibbon, *Decline and Fall*, Chapter XXXVIII

Isidore of Seville confirms civilizational separation:

> "Spain is bounded on one side by the Pyrenees, on another by the sea,
> and is thus distinguished from all other lands as though marked out
> by nature for a separate nation."
> — Isidore, *Etymologies*, Book XIV

ARC-T-EARLY-MOD — 1500–1800 AD
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Franco-Spanish border crystallizes along Pyrenean watershed.
Treaty of the Pyrenees (1659) confirms what geography established.
The mountains continue to separate distinct political systems.

Chris Wickham on post-Roman persistence:

> "The Pyrenees remained a significant barrier into the early medieval
> period, not preventing movement but channeling and slowing it,
> so that political developments on each side proceeded with relative
> independence from the other."
> — Wickham, *The Inheritance of Rome*

ARC-T-MODERN — 1800–Present
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Peter Heather on shock absorption:

> "The mountain barriers of the western Mediterranean—particularly
> the Pyrenees—reduced the intensity of the migration period's impact
> on the Iberian peninsula, allowing for more orderly transitions than
> occurred in more exposed regions."
> — Heather, *The Fall of the Roman Empire*

Horden and Purcell on Mediterranean microecologies:

> "Mountains like the Pyrenees create distinct microregions that
> develop their own rhythms, even when nominally part of the same
> political system; they are boundaries not of exclusion but of
> differential connection."
> — Horden & Purcell, *The Corrupting Sea*

V. COMPARATIVE GEOGRAPHIC LOGIC
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Pyrenees vs Alps:

**Alps:**
• Multidirectional passes
• Imperial crossroads
• High shock transmission
• Core instability (See MEM–ROME–GEO–ALPS)

**Pyrenees:**
• Fewer controlled passages
• Peripheral insulation
• Low shock transmission
• Stable differentiation

The Alps connect and expose; the Pyrenees separate and protect.
Same terrain type, different strategic function based on position.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Pyrenees encode **bounded continuity**.

Lessons preserved:
• Geography preserves diversity within empire
• Not all borders are militarized frontiers
• Civilizational transmission can be filtered, not blocked
• Peripheral insulation reduces collapse severity
• Long-term continuity favors controlled access
• Separation enables survival

The Pyrenees quietly protect Rome's western afterlife.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VIII. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• The Pyrenees separate without severing
• Roman civilization survives differently on each side
• Mountains shape memory more than battles
• Insulation enables continuity
• Iberia's quiet exit begins with geography
• Barriers that slow also preserve

Tension preserved without verdict.
