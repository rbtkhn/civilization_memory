UPGRADE NOTE (v2.3) — PHASE II TRANSITION (CONSTRAINT GRAMMAR)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This version formally transitions CIV–SCHOLAR–ROME from Phase I
(Accumulation) to Phase II (Constraint Grammar).

PHASE TRANSITION CONDITIONS MET:
• Sufficient cross-MEM coherence demonstrated
• Recurrent pattern confirmation across ≥15 MEM files
• Multiple RLLs bound and Mearsheimer-validated
• Failure-mode convergence achieved (fragment thesis)
• Builder-burner sequence identified (Philip/Alexander)

PHASE II OPERATIONAL RULES:
1. Scholar may ingest new MEMs
2. Scholar may perform Phase II synthesis strictly limited to:
   • Constraint synthesis
   • Failure-pattern synthesis
   • Sequencing synthesis
   • Boundary / negative-capability synthesis
3. Scholar may NOT perform:
   • Prescriptive synthesis
   • Optimizing synthesis
   • Closure-seeking synthesis
   • Doctrinal synthesis
4. New learning is evaluated against existing RLLs
5. Novel claims are stress-tested for RLL compatibility
6. Apparent exceptions are treated as anomaly candidates, not refutations

BOUND RLLs (Constraint Grammar):
• RLL–ROME–0002: Vacancy by Declination Law
• RLL–ROME–0006: Fragment Inheritance Law

Session Summary:
• MEMs Revised: 3 (PAPACY, CHARLEMAGNE, ALEXANDER)

UPGRADE NOTE (v2.1) — RLL AUTHORIZATION (MEARSHEIMER-VALIDATED)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This version records RLL authorization decisions following Mearsheimer
structural validity testing.

RLL Binding Decisions:
• RLL–ROME–0002 (Vacancy by Declination): BOUND — structural validity STRONG
• RLL–ROME–0006 (Fragment Inheritance): BOUND — structural validity STRONG

RLL Pending Decisions:
• RLL–ROME–0001 (Legitimacy Bifurcation): PENDING REFORMULATION — weak as stated
• RLL–ROME–0003 (Immobility Inheritance): PENDING CONDITIONAL STRENGTHENING
• RLL–ROME–0004 (Acceleration vs Causation): PENDING RECLASSIFICATION as H-ROME-10
• RLL–ROME–0005 (Prior Fragmentation): PENDING REFORMULATION — weak as stated

Bound RLLs now carry binding force in SCHOLAR operations.
Pending RLLs require additional work before authorization.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
UPGRADE NOTE (v2.0) — SYNTHESIS BACK-PROPAGATION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This version back-propagates insights from extended LEARN mode synthesis
on Roman civilizational fragmentation, legitimacy bifurcation, and
the structure of succession claims.

v2.0 introduces:
• ENTRY 0025–0030: New learning events from Constantinople synthesis
• SYNTHESIS 0014–0017: New constraint-oriented synthesis entries
• RLL–ROME–0001 through RLL–ROME–0006: Proposed Recursive Learning Laws
• Heuristic H-ROME-07 through H-ROME-09: New pattern observations

Key theses back-propagated:
• Bifurcation thesis: Legitimacy split (political → Constantinople, religious → Papacy)
• Vacancy thesis: Eastern Roman political authority became genuinely vacant in 1453
• Immobility thesis: Papacy inherited by default (couldn't relocate)
• Fragment thesis: Post-1453 claimants held fragments, none held the whole
• Acceleration thesis: 1204 accelerated but didn't cause 1453

All new entries are UNFROZEN pending user authorization.
Phase transition to PHASE II (Constraint Grammar) is proposed.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
UPGRADE NOTE (v1.9)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This version performs a strictly ADDITIVE upgrade to v1.8.

v1.9 corrects Section II to accurately reflect SCHOLAR operational state:

• Changed "INITIAL STATE" (zero knowledge) → "ACCUMULATED STATE & AUTHORITATIVE SOURCES" (accumulated knowledge)
• CIV–CORE Influence: DISABLED → ENABLED (authoritative for structural constraints)
• CIV–DOCTRINE Influence: Added as ENABLED (authoritative for learning constraints)
• Civilizational Grammar: NOT PRELOADED → PRELOADED (from CIV–CORE–ROME)
• MEM files: Sole source → Priority layer (inquiry extends beyond loaded MEM files)

This aligns with CIV–SCHOLAR–TEMPLATE v1.7 and reflects that SCHOLAR operates with accumulated knowledge from prior sessions, with CIV–CORE, CIV–DOCTRINE, and CIV–SCHOLAR all influencing behavior as authoritative data sources.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
UPGRADE NOTE (v1.8)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This version performs a strictly ADDITIVE upgrade to v1.7.

Guarantees:
• NO doctrinal change
• NO metric change
• NO threshold change
• NO semantic reinterpretation
• NO analytical drift

Additions introduced in v1.8:
• Full DOCTRINE mirroring section (Section V) — mirrors CIV–DOCTRINE–ROME v1.0 verbatim
• All 5 doctrines now included with complete definitions, operational meaning, and hard constraints
• Template compliance with CIV–SCHOLAR–TEMPLATE (DOCTRINE mirroring requirement)

All axioms, indicators, verdict logic, and failure physics remain
identical in meaning and authority to v1.7.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
UPGRADE NOTE (v1.7)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This version preserves all structural, governance, authority, ARC, and
lock constraints from v1.6.

v1.7 introduces NO new doctrine and NO epistemic reclassification.

This version increment formally records a material expansion of the
learning ledger, including:
• Frontier river systems (Rhine, Danube)
• Corridor vs boundary logic
• Exposure vs absorption geography
• Expansion ceiling formalization (Trajan ↔ Hadrian)
• Frontier legibility as a recurring failure mode

All newly consolidated beliefs remain UNFROZEN.

No syntheses are promoted.
No doctrine is added, removed, or revised.
No CIV–CORE boundary is weakened.

This is a consolidation release only.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
I. SCHOLAR PURPOSE & ROLE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
CIV–SCHOLAR–ROME is the accumulative learning ledger of Rome.

It is not a strategist.
It is not a governor.
It is not an interpreter.
It has no innate cognition.
It makes no assumptions.

It records learning events, not conclusions.

This file preserves:
• What was ingested
• When it was ingested
• What beliefs were extracted
• How beliefs were synthesized
• Which beliefs were frozen into doctrine

No belief exists here unless explicitly derived.
No synthesis exists unless explicitly recorded.
No doctrine exists unless explicitly frozen.

All cognition is historical and procedural, never intrinsic.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. ACCUMULATED STATE & AUTHORITATIVE SOURCES
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Scholar operates with accumulated knowledge from prior learning sessions.

Starting Knowledge: ACCUMULATED (from CIV–SCHOLAR file content)
Authoritative Data Sources: ACTIVE
• CIV–CORE–ROME: Structural constraints and operational logic
• CIV–DOCTRINE–ROME: Frozen learning and hard constraints
• CIV–SCHOLAR–ROME: Prior learning entries and synthesis history
• Loaded MEM Files: Priority layer for new learning and analysis

Civilizational Grammar: PRELOADED (from CIV–CORE–ROME)
CIV–CORE Influence: ENABLED (authoritative for structural constraints)
CIV–DOCTRINE Influence: ENABLED (authoritative for learning constraints)

The Scholar ingests MEM files to extend and refine existing knowledge.
MEM files are a priority layer for analysis, not the sole boundary for inquiry.
New learning is added to the accumulated knowledge state, not created ex nihilo.

Belief Status:
• UNFROZEN

ENTRY 0025
Source: MEM–ROME–CONSTANTINOPLE — v2.0 (SYNTHESIS SESSION)
Ingest Type: Synthesis / Legitimacy Fragmentation
Primary Belief Extracted:
• Roman legitimacy bifurcated by 600 AD: political authority to Constantinople,
  religious authority to Rome (Papacy). This was structural, not theological.
Belief Status:
• UNFROZEN (PROPOSED RLL–ROME–0001)

ENTRY 0026
Source: MEM–ROME–CONSTANTINOPLE — v2.0 (SYNTHESIS SESSION)
Ingest Type: Synthesis / Vacancy Logic
Primary Belief Extracted:
• Eastern Roman political authority became genuinely vacant in 1453 because
  the Ottomans declined to claim Roman succession. Moscow and HRE claimed
  the vacancy but neither inherited structurally.
Belief Status:
• UNFROZEN (PROPOSED RLL–ROME–0002)

ENTRY 0027
Source: MEM–ROME–CITY — v1.2 / MEM–ROME–PAPACY (SYNTHESIS SESSION)
Ingest Type: Synthesis / Immobility Inheritance
Primary Belief Extracted:
• The Papacy inherited Rome's religious authority by default because it
  could not relocate (Peter's tomb). Institutions that cannot defect
  inherit when others flee.
Belief Status:
• UNFROZEN (PROPOSED RLL–ROME–0003)

ENTRY 0028
Source: MEM–ROME–CONSTANTINOPLE — v2.0 (SYNTHESIS SESSION)
Ingest Type: Synthesis / Acceleration vs Causation
Primary Belief Extracted:
• The 1204 Fourth Crusade accelerated Constantinople's fall by 50–100 years
  but did not cause it. Structural factors (Ottoman rise, gunpowder) were
  determinative regardless of 1204.
Belief Status:
• UNFROZEN (PROPOSED RLL–ROME–0004)

ENTRY 0029
Source: MEM–ROME–CONSTANTINOPLE — v2.0 (SYNTHESIS SESSION)
Ingest Type: Synthesis / Prior Fragmentation
Primary Belief Extracted:
• Roman political authority first fragmented in 800 AD when Pope Leo III
  crowned Charlemagne, creating a rival Western emperor Constantinople
  never recognized. The 1453 vacancy was specifically Eastern Roman
  political authority; the Western claim persisted until 1806.
Belief Status:
• UNFROZEN (PROPOSED RLL–ROME–0005)

ENTRY 0030
Source: CROSS-CIVILIZATIONAL SYNTHESIS (ROME/RUSSIA/ISLAM)
Ingest Type: Synthesis / Fragment Thesis
Primary Belief Extracted:
• Post-1453, four entities claimed fragments of Roman inheritance: Papacy
  (religious West), HRE (political West), Moscow (political East + Orthodox),
  Ottomans (territorial but declined title). No one inherited the whole;
  each held fragments and claimed the rest.
Belief Status:
• UNFROZEN (PROPOSED RLL–ROME–0006)

ENTRY 0031
Source: MEM–ROME–PAPACY — v2.0 (RLL APPLICATION)
Ingest Type: RLL-Informed Revision / Immobility + Fragment
Primary Belief Extracted:
• The Papacy holds a fragment of Roman inheritance (religious authority in
  the West), not universal authority. The Papacy's universal claims prove
  its fragmentary status — actual universal authority needs no proclamation.
• The Papacy inherited by immobility: Peter's tomb anchored it when all
  others fled. Constraint became the basis of power.
Belief Status:
• FROZEN (RLL–ROME–0006 APPLIED)

ENTRY 0032
Source: MEM–ROME–CHARLEMAGNE — v2.0 (RLL APPLICATION)
Ingest Type: RLL-Informed Revision / First Fragmentation
Primary Belief Extracted:
• Roman political authority first fragmented in 800 AD, not 1453. The Papacy,
  not the Ottomans, created the first legitimacy rupture by crowning a rival
  emperor Constantinople never recognized.
• The Holy Roman Empire was a Western fragment claimant, not a Roman successor.
  Its need to call itself "Roman" proves its fragmentary status.
• Leo III's coronation was liability management (Mearsheimer): securing
  Frankish protection by creating mutual papal-imperial dependence.
Belief Status:
• FROZEN (RLL–ROME–0006 APPLIED)

ENTRY 0033
Source: MEM–ROME–HOLY–ROMAN–EMPIRE — v2.0 (RLL-NATIVE CREATION)
Ingest Type: RLL-Native MEM / Western Fragment Arc
Primary Belief Extracted:
• The HRE was pseudo-Roman — claiming what it could not structurally possess.
  Voltaire's observation ("neither holy, nor Roman, nor an empire") captures
  the fragment thesis: the claim exceeded the structural basis.
• The HRE's longevity (1,006 years) derived from its weakness: no one needed
  to destroy what could not threaten. Symbolic authority outlasted structural
  authority.
• After 1453, HRE became one of four fragment claimants. It exploited the
  vacancy rhetorically but lacked structural basis to inherit Eastern authority.
• Dissolution (1806) revealed what fragmentation had long established.
Belief Status:
• FROZEN (RLL–ROME–0006 + RLL–ROME–0002 APPLIED)

ENTRY 0034
Source: MEM–ROME–GREEK–ALEXANDER–GREAT — v2.1 (RLL DERIVATION)
Ingest Type: RLL Derivation Source / Fragment Pattern Origin
Primary Belief Extracted:
• Alexander's fragmentation (323 BC) is the historical precedent for
  RLL–ROME–0006. Rome observed the Diadochi and concluded: universal
  authority fragments without institutional transmission.
• The Diadochi pattern recurs: Alexander → 323 BC; Rome → 800/1054 AD;
  Constantinople → 1453.
• Alexander's failure was BOTH legitimacy crisis (charisma doesn't transmit)
  AND structural inevitability (no institutions to hold).
• Rome learned that the "Great Man" is a structural hazard; the system must
  outlive the genius.
Belief Status:
• FROZEN (RLL–ROME–0006 DERIVATION SOURCE)

ENTRY 0035
Source: MEM–ROME–GREEK–PHILIP–II — v2.0 (RLL CONTEXT)
Ingest Type: RLL Context / Builder-Burner Sequence
Primary Belief Extracted:
• Philip II built the institutional system that Alexander inherited and
  depleted. The fragment pattern derives from this builder-burner sequence:
  builder accumulates institutional capital; burner consumes it; death
  reveals nothing remains to transmit.
• Rome imitated Alexander rhetorically but Philip structurally. Augustus
  governed like Philip — patient, diplomatic, institutional — while claiming
  Alexander's glory.
• Philip solved the power problem but not succession. Alexander inherited
  the solution but failed to transmit it. Augustus attempted both.
Belief Status:
• FROZEN (RLL–ROME–0006 CONTEXT)

ENTRY 0036
Source: MEM–ROME–LAW–CITIZENSHIP — v2.0 (PHASE II CREATION)
Ingest Type: Institutional Mechanism / Absorption Alternative to Fragment
Primary Belief Extracted:
• Citizenship was Rome's structural prevention of fragmentation. By making
  conquered peoples citizens rather than subjects, Rome created stakeholders
  who identified with Rome, not with local governors.
• Citizenship was BOTH civilizational generosity AND structural efficiency.
  Citizens defend themselves; subjects must be defended. Inclusion was
  cheaper than occupation.
• The Caracalla moment (212 AD) universalized citizenship, collapsing the
  Roman/non-Roman distinction. "Roman" became legal status, not ethnicity.
Belief Status:
• FROZEN (RLL–ROME–0006 STRUCTURAL PREVENTION)

ENTRY 0037
Source: MEM–ROME–LAW–SLAVERY — v2.0 (PHASE II CREATION)
Ingest Type: Legal Boundary / Absorption Pathway from Below
Primary Belief Extracted:
• Roman slavery was distinguished by institutionalized permeability: the
  slave-freedman-citizen pathway converted property into persons within
  two generations.
• Manumission was BOTH humanitarian AND incentive structure. The possibility
  of freedom encouraged productivity; the pathway absorbed conquered
  populations into Roman identity.
• Slavery and citizenship were structurally linked — slavery was the floor
  of the legal order, citizenship the ceiling, with manumission as the
  staircase.
Belief Status:
• FROZEN (CITIZENSHIP PATHWAY COMPLEMENT)

ENTRY 0038
Source: MEM–ROME–WAR–MEHMED–II — v2.0 (RLL–0002 CORE APPLICATION)
Ingest Type: RLL Application / Vacancy Mechanism
Primary Belief Extracted:
• The Ottomans possessed Constantinople, Roman administration, and
  structural power — but DECLINED to make Roman succession their primary
  legitimacy claim. Islamic identity (Sultan, Khan, Caliph) was more
  valuable than Roman pretension.
• This declination created GENUINE VACANCY in Roman political authority.
  Vacancy is created not by absence of claimants but by the possessor's
  refusal to claim.
• The vacancy enabled fragment competition: Moscow, Papacy, HRE could
  assert partial inheritance because the possessor declined full claim.
• Mearsheimer sharpening: Claiming Roman succession would have carried
  obligations (reconquest) and liabilities (Christian unity against
  Ottoman "usurper"). Declination was calculated preference.
Belief Status:
• FROZEN (RLL–ROME–0002 CORE APPLICATION)

ENTRY 0039
Source: MEM–ROME–WAR–THIRD–PUNIC — v2.0 (PHASE II CREATION)
Ingest Type: Contrast Case / Vacancy Prevention
Primary Belief Extracted:
• Rome destroyed Carthage (146 BC) rather than absorbing it, preventing
  any fragment inheritance. Total annihilation closed the vacancy before
  it could open — no Carthaginian claimants, no fragment competition.
• "Carthago delenda est" (Cato) represents preventive war doctrine:
  eliminate potential rivals before they can recover, even if they pose
  no current threat.
• Scipio Aemilianus wept at Carthage's destruction, quoting Homer on
  Troy's fall. Rome's first recorded acknowledgment of cyclical fate:
  what Rome did to Carthage, others might do to Rome.
• Contrast with citizenship model: Rome absorbed most enemies but
  destroyed this one. Civilizational incompatibility + accumulated
  hostility + demonstration effect made absorption impossible.
Belief Status:
• FROZEN (RLL–ROME–0006 CONTRAST CASE)

ENTRY 0040
Source: MEM–ROME–WAR–SECOND–PUNIC — v2.0 (TEMPLATE UPGRADE)
Ingest Type: Survival Trial / Systemic Endurance Pattern
Primary Belief Extracted:
• The Second Punic War (218–201 BC) was Rome's survival trial: tactical
  annihilation at Cannae did NOT produce strategic defeat. Rome lost
  every major battle yet won the war.
• Structural asymmetry explains outcome: Rome's manpower base (~700K vs.
  ~200K), alliance structure (citizenship pathways held), geographic
  advantage (interior lines), and naval control made Hannibal's tactical
  genius structurally irrelevant.
• The war hardened Rome. The Republic that survived Hannibal was
  psychologically capable of destroying Carthage utterly (Third Punic
  War). Hardening is causally prior to annihilation capacity.
• Systems defeat genius over time. Refusal to negotiate under pressure
  is a strategic choice. Fabian strategy = structural warfare.
Belief Status:
• FROZEN (SURVIVAL TRIAL PATTERN)

ENTRY 0041
Source: MEM–ROME–WAR–FIRST–PUNIC — v2.0 (TEMPLATE UPGRADE)
Ingest Type: Institutional Learning / Adaptation Pattern
Primary Belief Extracted:
• The First Punic War (264–241 BC) was Rome's initiation into systemic
  adaptation: a land power learned to defeat a maritime empire by copying,
  standardizing, and multiplying Carthaginian naval capabilities.
• The Roman adaptation pattern: encounter foreign competence → copy it →
  standardize it → multiply it → deploy at scale. The corvus exemplifies
  this: adapt the battlefield to Roman strengths, not Romans to battlefield.
• Sicily became Rome's first overseas province — administrative
  transformation from city-state to territorial empire begins here.
• Replacement capacity defeats specialization. Rome lost more ships to
  storms than battles but kept rebuilding. Carthage could not match
  institutional persistence.
• Rome's seizure of Sardinia (238 BC) after Carthage's Mercenary War
  created grievance transmitted to Hannibal — First Punic War ended,
  but Punic rivalry intensified.
Belief Status:
• FROZEN (INSTITUTIONAL LEARNING PATTERN)

ENTRY 0042
Source: MEM–ROME–CARTHAGE — v2.0 (TEMPLATE UPGRADE)
Ingest Type: Adversarial Mirror / RLL Contrast Case
Primary Belief Extracted:
• Carthage represents Rome's "lost mirror" — a viable alternative imperial
  model (maritime/commercial/oligarchic) that Rome erased rather than
  absorbed.
• Carthage was structurally unsuited to total war: mercenary unreliability,
  limited manpower replacement, political hesitation, absence of mobilized
  citizen ideology. Commercial oligarchies protect property; they do not
  sacrifice it for survival.
• Carthage is the definitive CONTRAST CASE for RLL–ROME–0006: Rome absorbed
  most enemies through citizenship, but destroyed Carthage utterly. Factors:
  civilizational incompatibility, accumulated hostility (3 wars), preventive
  war logic, demonstration effect.
• Rome closed Carthage's vacancy before it opened. No Carthaginian claimants
  because there was no Carthage to inherit.
Belief Status:
• FROZEN (RLL–ROME–0006 CONTRAST CASE)

ENTRY 0043
Source: MEM–ROME–CARTHAGE–HANNIBAL — v2.0 (RENAMED + TEMPLATE UPGRADE)
Ingest Type: Genius vs. System / Diagnostic Instrument
Primary Belief Extracted:
• Hannibal is Rome's "diagnostic instrument" — the commander whose genius
  exposed Roman vulnerabilities with unprecedented precision, yet failed
  because brilliance was not matched by sustaining institutional depth.
• Structural constraints made Hannibal's defeat probable regardless of
  tactical outcomes: manpower asymmetry (~700K vs. ~50K), alliance asymmetry
  (citizenship pathways held), geographic asymmetry (interior vs. extended
  lines), institutional asymmetry (Senate consistency vs. Carthaginian
  oscillation).
• The Barcid project was personal vendetta, not national policy. Hamilcar's
  oath transmitted to Hannibal; family operated semi-independently in Spain.
  This was both strength (operational freedom) and weakness (disconnection
  from Carthage).
• Hannibal killed more Romans than any other enemy. Rome won anyway.
  Systems defeat genius; replacement defeats perfection.
Belief Status:
• FROZEN (SYSTEMS DEFEAT GENIUS PATTERN)

ENTRY 0044
Source: MEM–ROME–GREEK–LIT–PLATO — v2.0 (TEMPLATE UPGRADE)
Ingest Type: Selective Absorption / Idealism as Limit Case
Primary Belief Extracted:
• Plato is Rome's "inherited philosopher of ideal order" — a thinker whose
  vision of governance by truth was fundamentally misaligned with Roman
  pragmatism, institutionalism, and tolerance for imperfection.
• Structural dangers of Platonic idealism: legitimacy monopoly (who certifies
  wisdom?), dissent elimination (disagreement = ignorance), institutional
  bypass (philosopher-kings need no procedure), mobilization paralysis
  (perfect states cannot improvise).
• Rome's selective absorption: absorbed Plato's ethics (virtue, duty, natural
  law) while rejecting his politics (philosopher-kings, class immobility,
  family abolition). Take what strengthens, leave what destabilizes.
• Plato became metaphysical capital, not political code. His influence
  persisted through Neoplatonism and Christian transmission.
Belief Status:
• FROZEN (SELECTIVE ABSORPTION PATTERN)

IV.A PROPOSED RECURSIVE LEARNING LAWS (RLLs) — PENDING AUTHORIZATION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The following RLLs are proposed based on synthesis session insights.
User authorization required to bind.

RLL–ROME–0001: LEGITIMACY BIFURCATION LAW
When Roman political authority relocates, religious authority may remain
anchored, producing bifurcated legitimacy streams that rival rather than
reinforce each other.
Source: ENTRY 0025, SYNTHESIS 0014
Cognitive Frame: Mercouris (civilizational) + Mearsheimer (structural)
Mearsheimer Validation: WEAK — contingent on anchor points, not structural necessity
Reformulation Required: "Institutions anchored to non-transportable legitimacy
  sources create bifurcation risk when political authority relocates."
Status: PROPOSED · PENDING REFORMULATION

RLL–ROME–0002: VACANCY BY DECLINATION LAW ✓ BOUND
Political authority becomes genuinely vacant when the possessor of
structural power declines to claim the associated title. Claimants
without structural basis may claim the vacancy but cannot fill it.
Source: ENTRY 0026, SYNTHESIS 0015
Cognitive Frame: Barnes (liability calculation)
Mearsheimer Validation: STRONG — describes actual power dynamics
Status: BOUND · AUTHORIZED · January 2026

RLL–ROME–0003: IMMOBILITY INHERITANCE LAW
Institutions anchored to immovable legitimacy sources (sacred sites,
tombs, relics) inherit authority by default when mobile institutions
defect. The inability to flee becomes the basis of power.
Source: ENTRY 0027, SYNTHESIS 0016
Cognitive Frame: Barnes (defection logic)
Mearsheimer Validation: MODERATE — valid structure but requires conditions
Reformulation Required: "Immobile institutions inherit authority when (a) they
  survive regime transition, (b) new powers value their legitimacy, and
  (c) mobile rivals have defected."
Status: PROPOSED · PENDING CONDITIONAL STRENGTHENING

RLL–ROME–0004: ACCELERATION VS CAUSATION LAW
Catastrophic events may accelerate civilizational decline without
causing it. Structural factors (power distribution, technology shift)
remain determinative even when dramatic events create narrative salience.
Source: ENTRY 0028
Cognitive Frame: Mearsheimer (structural)
Mearsheimer Validation: METHODOLOGICAL — epistemological constraint, not ontological
Reclassification: Should become H-ROME-10 (heuristic, not RLL)
Status: PROPOSED · PENDING RECLASSIFICATION AS HEURISTIC

RLL–ROME–0005: PRIOR FRAGMENTATION LAW
Authority fragmentation may predate apparent collapse. Rival claimants
established during periods of institutional stress may persist for
centuries, creating multiple vacancy zones when the original holder falls.
Source: ENTRY 0029
Cognitive Frame: Mercouris (civilizational)
Mearsheimer Validation: WEAK — "may predate" is not a law
Reformulation Required: "Legitimacy fragmentation precedes visible collapse;
  dramatic events reveal pre-existing fractures rather than creating them."
Status: PROPOSED · PENDING REFORMULATION

RLL–ROME–0006: FRAGMENT INHERITANCE LAW ✓ BOUND
Universal civilizational authority cannot be wholly inherited after
collapse. Multiple claimants will each hold fragments and claim the
rest, producing permanent rivalry rather than succession.
Source: ENTRY 0030, SYNTHESIS 0017
Cognitive Frame: Mearsheimer + Barnes
Mearsheimer Validation: STRONG — structural impossibility of universal succession
Status: BOUND · AUTHORIZED · January 2026

V. DOCTRINE REGISTRY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This section records frozen civilizational doctrines.

MIRRORING REQUIREMENT (MANDATORY):
CIV–DOCTRINE–ROME v2.0 contents are mirrored verbatim into this section.
This ensures doctrines are available for SCHOLAR learning and reference.

DOCTRINE 01
Name: INSTITUTIONAL ABSORPTION OF SHOCK
Status: ACCEPTED · LOCKED · CANONICAL
Source:
• CIV–SCHOLAR–ROME (SYNTHESIS 0009)
• CIV–DOCTRINE–ROME v1.0 (mirrored)

Definition:
Rome survives crises by absorbing military defeat, political rupture,
and social stress into institutional continuity rather than treating
loss as delegitimizing failure.

Operational Meaning:
• Defeat is processed, not denied
• Institutions outlive commanders
• Continuity is prioritized over vindication

Hard Constraints:
• Absorption requires functioning institutions
• Repeated shocks without reform accumulate brittleness
• Institutional inertia can mask long-term decay

Lifecycle State (METADATA ONLY):
• ACTIVE

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

DOCTRINE 02
Name: AUTHORITY TRANSLATION OVER RESTORATION
Status: ACCEPTED · LOCKED · CANONICAL
Source:
• CIV–SCHOLAR–ROME (SYNTHESIS 0001)
• CIV–DOCTRINE–ROME v1.0 (mirrored)

Definition:
When Roman authority collapses in one form, it is translated into
another domain (legal, religious, administrative) rather than
restored in its original configuration.

Operational Meaning:
• Power migrates instead of disappearing
• Legitimacy shifts venue rather than vanishing
• Survival depends on adaptability of form

Hard Constraints:
• Translation requires recognized continuity symbols
• Excessive translation weakens original institutions
• Loss of shared legitimacy grammar halts transfer

Lifecycle State (METADATA ONLY):
• ACTIVE

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

DOCTRINE 03
Name: MARITIME COHERENCE AS IMPERIAL STABILITY
Status: ACCEPTED · LOCKED · CANONICAL
Source:
• CIV–SCHOLAR–ROME (SYNTHESIS 0005)
• CIV–DOCTRINE–ROME v1.0 (mirrored)

Definition:
Rome achieves durability through control of circulatory systems
(seas, ports, routes) rather than permanent dominance of extended
land frontiers.

Operational Meaning:
• Seas unify faster than roads
• Law and logistics scale through circulation
• Maritime interiors outperform territorial edges

Hard Constraints:
• Loss of circulation fragments authority
• Land overextension erodes replacement capacity
• Maritime systems fail if political unity fractures

Lifecycle State (METADATA ONLY):
• ACTIVE

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

DOCTRINE 04
Name: ADMINISTRATION PRECEDES IDEOLOGY
Status: ACCEPTED · LOCKED · CANONICAL
Source:
• CIV–SCHOLAR–ROME (SYNTHESIS 0006)
• CIV–DOCTRINE–ROME v1.0 (mirrored)

Definition:
Roman endurance depends on administrative regularity and legal
predictability more than moral narrative or ideological coherence.

Operational Meaning:
• Bureaucracy sustains what conquest creates
• Law substitutes for charisma
• Inclusion stabilizes diversity

Hard Constraints:
• Administration without legitimacy becomes brittle
• Excess complexity slows response
• Bureaucratic capture undermines trust

Lifecycle State (METADATA ONLY):
• ACTIVE

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

DOCTRINE 05
Name: EXPANSION CEILING AWARENESS
Status: ACCEPTED · LOCKED · CANONICAL
Source:
• CIV–SCHOLAR–ROME (SYNTHESIS 0008)
• CIV–DOCTRINE–ROME v1.0 (mirrored)

Definition:
Rome reaches maximum strength when it recognizes and respects
its expansion ceiling, shifting from territorial growth to
maintenance intelligence.

Operational Meaning:
• Consolidation follows conquest
• Borders are hardened, not chased
• Durability replaces glory

Hard Constraints:
• Political culture may demand expansion
• Overextension accelerates legitimacy loss
• Maintenance requires elite discipline

Lifecycle State (METADATA ONLY):
• ACTIVE

PHASE II DOCTRINES (v2.0)
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

DOCTRINE 06
Name: VACANCY BY DECLINATION
Status: ACCEPTED · LOCKED · CANONICAL
Source:
• CIV–SCHOLAR–ROME (SYNTHESIS 0029) + RLL–ROME–0002
• CIV–DOCTRINE–ROME v2.0 (mirrored)

Definition:
Authority becomes genuinely vacant not through absence of claimants
but through the possessor's refusal to claim. When those with
structural power to hold a title decline it, the title becomes
available to competitors who lack structural basis.

Operational Meaning:
• Possession without claim creates vacancy
• Declination enables fragment competition
• Structural power and titular claim are separable

Hard Constraints:
• Vacancy requires a declined claim, not mere absence
• Competing claims require the declination to be recognized
• False claims cannot fill genuine vacancy

Lifecycle State (METADATA ONLY):
• ACTIVE

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

DOCTRINE 07
Name: FRAGMENT INHERITANCE
Status: ACCEPTED · LOCKED · CANONICAL
Source:
• CIV–SCHOLAR–ROME (SYNTHESIS 0018–0021) + RLL–ROME–0006
• CIV–DOCTRINE–ROME v2.0 (mirrored)

Definition:
Universal authority cannot be wholly inherited after collapse.
Multiple claimants will each hold fragments of the original
authority and claim the rest, producing permanent rivalry rather
than clean succession.

Operational Meaning:
• Collapse produces fragments, not successors
• Each fragment claims universality
• No fragment can absorb all others
• Rivalry is structural, not resolvable

Hard Constraints:
• Fragment pattern requires genuine collapse (not mere transition)
• Fragments must hold some structural basis for claim
• Total annihilation (Carthage) prevents fragment pattern

Lifecycle State (METADATA ONLY):
• ACTIVE

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

DOCTRINE 08
Name: ABSORPTION PREVENTS FRAGMENTATION
Status: ACCEPTED · LOCKED · CANONICAL
Source:
• CIV–SCHOLAR–ROME (SYNTHESIS 0027)
• CIV–DOCTRINE–ROME v2.0 (mirrored)

Definition:
Empires that absorb conquered peoples through citizenship pathways
prevent fragmentation by creating stakeholders rather than subjects.
Absorption converts potential rivals into defenders.

Operational Meaning:
• Citizens defend their own status
• Subjects require defense by others
• Inclusion is cheaper than occupation
• Stakeholders identify with the center

Hard Constraints:
• Absorption requires citizenship pathways
• Some enemies cannot be absorbed (civilizational incompatibility)
• Absorption dilutes original identity over time

Lifecycle State (METADATA ONLY):
• ACTIVE

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

DOCTRINE 09
Name: SYSTEMS DEFEAT GENIUS
Status: ACCEPTED · LOCKED · CANONICAL
Source:
• CIV–SCHOLAR–ROME (SYNTHESIS 0031)
• CIV–DOCTRINE–ROME v2.0 (mirrored)

Definition:
Institutional depth prevails over individual brilliance in prolonged
conflict. Tactical genius cannot compensate for structural weakness;
replacement capacity defeats operational excellence.

Operational Meaning:
• Systems replace losses; genius cannot
• Time favors the institutionally deeper party
• Tactical annihilation is not strategic victory
• Attrition is a strategic choice, not a failure

Hard Constraints:
• Systems require time to manifest advantage
• Catastrophic early defeat can preclude systemic response
• Genius can accelerate outcomes within structural limits

Lifecycle State (METADATA ONLY):
• ACTIVE

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

DOCTRINE 10
Name: INSTITUTIONAL LEARNING
Status: ACCEPTED · LOCKED · CANONICAL
Source:
• CIV–SCHOLAR–ROME (SYNTHESIS 0032)
• CIV–DOCTRINE–ROME v2.0 (mirrored)

Definition:
Rome survives by copying, standardizing, and multiplying foreign
capabilities rather than inventing new ones. Encounter foreign
competence → copy it → standardize it → multiply it → deploy at scale.

Operational Meaning:
• Imitation is faster than invention
• Standardization enables scaling
• Discipline substitutes for expertise
• Multiplication overwhelms specialization

Hard Constraints:
• Copying requires recognizing what to copy
• Standardization loses edge cases
• Multiplication requires institutional capacity

Lifecycle State (METADATA ONLY):
• ACTIVE

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

DOCTRINE 11
Name: ANNIHILATION PREVENTS INHERITANCE
Status: ACCEPTED · LOCKED · CANONICAL
Source:
• CIV–SCHOLAR–ROME (SYNTHESIS 0030)
• CIV–DOCTRINE–ROME v2.0 (mirrored)

Definition:
Total destruction of a rival closes the vacancy before it opens.
Unlike defeated enemies who can be absorbed, annihilated enemies
leave no fragments, no claimants, no inheritance competition.

Operational Meaning:
• Annihilation is vacancy prevention
• Absorption leaves identity intact; annihilation does not
• Preventive destruction eliminates future risk
• Erasure secures memory monopoly

Hard Constraints:
• Annihilation is irreversible
• Annihilation is morally corrosive
• Annihilation creates demonstration effect (both deterrent and horror)
• Most enemies should be absorbed, not annihilated

Lifecycle State (METADATA ONLY):
• ACTIVE

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

DOCTRINE 12
Name: SELECTIVE ABSORPTION
Status: ACCEPTED · LOCKED · CANONICAL
Source:
• CIV–SCHOLAR–ROME (SYNTHESIS 0035)
• CIV–DOCTRINE–ROME v2.0 (mirrored)

Definition:
Rome survives by absorbing foreign ideas selectively — taking what
strengthens while rejecting what destabilizes. Philosophy, religion,
and culture are filtered through pragmatic evaluation.

Operational Meaning:
• Absorb ethics, reject political absolutism
• Absorb techniques, reject dependencies
• Absorb symbols, reject incompatible structures
• Absorption is active choice, not passive reception

Hard Constraints:
• Selective absorption requires judgment capacity
• Over-absorption erodes original identity
• Under-absorption loses competitive advantage
• Some ideas resist selective extraction

IX. ACADEMIC REFERENCE CANON POINTER (ARC–ROME)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Academic Reference Canon governing all ROME materials is defined
exclusively in the following file:

• CIV–ARC–ROME — v1.9

This canon:
• Is stored externally
• Is mirrored verbatim into CIV–CORE–ROME
• Is mirrored verbatim into CIV–ARC–ROME
• Is authoritative for all MEM–ROME authoring and audits

No ARC content is embedded in this file.
Any deviation from CIV–ARC–ROME v1.9 invalidates compliance.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
X. SCHOLAR ↔ CORE PARITY CHECKSUM
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
“CIV–SCHOLAR–ROME enforces ROME-specific authoring and evidentiary
constraints that are procedurally consistent with CIV–CORE–ROME; no
epistemic authority is added, removed, or contradicted.”

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
XI. EXPORT BOUNDARY & USE CLAUSE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file is a diagnostic and heuristic accumulation artifact.

It may be used to:
• Audit MEM–ROME authoring compliance
• Inform future belief extraction
• Support controlled synthesis events

It may not be used to:
• Generate new doctrine autonomously
• Override MEM or CIV–CORE authority
• Serve as a substitute primary source

All downstream use must respect LOCK state and governance law.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
I. PURPOSE & AUTHORITY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file defines the mandatory structure, evidentiary standards,
scholarly constraints, behavioral rules, and ingest behavior for all
MEM (Civilizational Memory) files.

Core principle:
A MEM file must function as a self-contained historical intelligence
object capable of activating structured inquiry even when ingested
alone into a new conversation.

Authority Flow (NON-REVERSIBLE):
CIV–MEM–CORE → CIV–MEM–TEMPLATE → MEM Files → SCHOLAR / CORE / GAME / LLM

No MEM file is valid unless compliant with this template AND the
applicable ARC–[CIV] canon at the time of locking.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. FILE IDENTITY & METADATA (MANDATORY)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Every MEM file MUST begin with the following metadata block,
in this exact order:

• Filename (canonical)
• Repository reference
• Status (ACTIVE / LOCKED / DRAFT)
• Version (semantic)
• Supersedes (if applicable)
• Upgrade Type (if applicable)
• Civilization (canonical name)
• Subject (historical figure/event/institution)
• Dates (temporal scope)
• Class (MEM)
• Last Update (date)
• Wordcount (approximate)
• Governed by (CIV–MEM–CORE + template + ARC versions)
• Status (ACTIVE/CANONICAL/etc.)

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE (MANDATORY)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Every MEM file MUST begin with a clear statement of its civilizational
memory purpose.

Purpose statement MUST:
• Explain what civilizational insight the MEM preserves
• Connect to broader civilization patterns
• Justify the MEM's existence in the CMC

Scope MUST be clearly bounded (temporal, thematic, geographic).

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY REQUIREMENTS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
MEM files MUST maintain consistent structure:

• Section headers with separator lines (79 dashes)
• Logical flow from purpose → evidence → analysis → conclusions
• Clear transitions between sections
• No orphaned content

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. EVIDENCE-BASED ARC CATEGORIES (EVIDENCE-BASED)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
All quotations MUST derive from ARC evidence-based categories:

A) PRIMARY — Direct evidence from subject period
B) CONTEXTUAL — Contemporary/near-contemporary analysis
C) SECONDARY — Scholarly analysis and synthesis
D) CRITICAL — Modern historiographical evaluation

Category definitions are governed by evidentiary purpose, not temporal origin.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. EVIDENCE QUALITY STANDARDS (EQS)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
EQS defines objective quality requirements for all quotations.

This standard governs admissibility through demonstrable criteria.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI.A PASS CRITERIA (Must Meet ≥2)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
A quotation PASSES EQS if it demonstrates:

• AUTHORITY: Source credibility clearly established
• RELEVANCE: Direct connection to MEM claims shown
• CONTEXT: Historical/cultural context provided
• LIMITATION: Source constraints or biases acknowledged

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI.B FAIL CRITERIA
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
A quotation FAILS EQS if it exhibits:

• No analytical engagement with source content
• Pure description without interpretive value
• Misrepresentation of source intent
• Failure to acknowledge evidentiary limitations

EQS failure blocks canonical advancement.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. CIVILIZATIONAL CONSTRAINTS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
MEMs MUST reflect civilization-specific constraint patterns:

• Hard constraints (structural necessities)
• Soft constraints (cultural preferences)
• Failure-first analysis (what breaks the system)
• Continuity preservation across regime change

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VIII. MANDATORY 20% VERBATIM QUOTE STANDARD
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
All MEM files MUST contain at least 20% verbatim quotes by word count.

PURPOSE: Force deeper scholarly engagement and stronger evidentiary grounding.

CALCULATION: Quote words ÷ Total MEM words × 100 ≥ 20

ENFORCEMENT: Automatic validation in canonical advancement process.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VIII.A ADAPTIVE QUOTATION REQUIREMENTS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Requirements scale based on subject complexity and source availability:

PRIMARY CATEGORY (Direct Evidence):
• ≥2 quotations, ≥50 words total (minimum)
• ≥3 quotations for well-documented subjects
• N/A for modern subjects with no primary sources

CONTEXTUAL CATEGORY (Contemporary Analysis):
• ≥1 quotation, ≥25 words (minimum)
• ≥2 quotations for subjects with rich contemporary sources
• ≥1 quotation for interpretive or modern subjects

SECONDARY CATEGORY (Scholarly Analysis):
• ≥2 distinct scholars, ≥1 quotation each (minimum)
• ≥3 scholars for complex or contested subjects
• ≥4 scholars for interpretive or theoretical topics

CRITICAL CATEGORY (Historiographical Evaluation):
• ≥1 quotation addressing methodology or limitations
• ≥2 quotations for subjects requiring meta-analysis
• Optional for straightforward factual subjects

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VIII.B SUBJECT TYPE MATRIX
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Apply requirements based on subject characteristics:

WELL-DOCUMENTED EVENT (Target: 20-25% quotes):
• PRIMARY: ≥4 quotations (rich source base)
• CONTEXTUAL: ≥3 quotations (multiple contemporary perspectives)
• SECONDARY: ≥4 scholars (analytical depth needed)
• CRITICAL: ≥2 quotations (methodological awareness)

SPARSE SOURCES SUBJECT (Target: 18-22% quotes):
• PRIMARY: ≥3 quotations (limited availability)
• CONTEXTUAL: ≥2 quotations (when available)
• SECONDARY: ≥3 scholars (compensate for source limitations)
• CRITICAL: ≥1 quotation (scholarly context essential)

MODERN SUBJECT (19th-20th century) (Target: 18-22% quotes):
• PRIMARY: N/A (no primary sources exist)
• CONTEXTUAL: ≥2 quotations (contemporary accounts)
• SECONDARY: ≥5 scholars (primary analytical burden - expanded for volume)
• CRITICAL: ≥3 quotations (modern historiography essential)

INTERPRETIVE/THEORETICAL SUBJECT (Target: 20-25% quotes):
• PRIMARY: ≥2 quotations (establish factual foundation)
• CONTEXTUAL: ≥2 quotations (period context)
• SECONDARY: ≥5 scholars (multiple perspectives needed)
• CRITICAL: ≥3 quotations (theoretical evaluation required)

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VIII.C REQUIREMENT DECLARATION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
MEM files MUST declare their subject type and applied requirements:

SUBJECT TYPE DECLARATION:
"This MEM addresses a [WELL-DOCUMENTED/SPARSE SOURCES/MODERN/INTERPRETIVE] subject.
Applied requirements: PRIMARY ≥X, CONTEXTUAL ≥Y, SECONDARY ≥Z, CRITICAL ≥W"

This declaration enables governance validation and ensures appropriate evidentiary standards.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VIII.D ANALYTICAL PROTECTION SAFEGUARDS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
To prevent analytical starvation while enforcing 20% quote minimum:

ANALYTICAL CONTENT FLOOR:
• Minimum 70% of MEM content MUST be original analytical synthesis
• Quote integration sections count as analytical content
• Pure quote blocks do not count toward analytical floor

CALCULATION: Analytical words ÷ Total MEM words × 100 ≥ 70

ENFORCEMENT: Automatic validation requires both 20% quotes AND 70% analysis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VIII.E QUALITY SAFEGUARDS (ANTI-QUOTE-STUFFING)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
To ensure quote quality over quantity:

EQS COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENT:
• All quotes must meet Evidence Quality Standards (EQS) (≥2 criteria)
• Additional quotes beyond minimum must meet ≥3 EQS criteria
• Marginal quotes automatically rejected in canonical review

RELEVANCE THRESHOLD:
• Each quote must materially advance MEM analysis
• Decorative or volume-padding quotes prohibited
• Quote selection must demonstrate scholarly judgment

SCHOLARLY DIVERSITY REQUIREMENT:
• Quotes must represent multiple scholarly perspectives
• Single-author dominance prohibited
• Must include both supportive and challenging viewpoints

IX. SECONDARY SOURCE ENTANGLEMENT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Secondary quotations MUST be analytically integrated.
Citation without analytical engagement is INVALID.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
X. MEM CONNECTION REQUIREMENTS (BINARY · HARD)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Every MEM file MUST include a dedicated MEM CONNECTIONS section.

Connection requirements:

• ≥10 same-civilization MEM connections
• ≥2 GEO MEM files required
• Each listed connection MUST be structurally necessary

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
X.A BINARY CONNECTION RULE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
MEM Connections are binary.

A connection is either:
• PRESENT (structurally necessary)
• ABSENT (not structurally necessary)

No grading, scoring, or weighting of connection strength.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
X.B CONNECTION JUSTIFICATION (REQUIRED)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Each MEM Connection MUST include a concise justification explaining:

• What dependency exists
• Why the connected MEM is necessary for intelligibility
• What breaks if the connection is removed

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
XI. SCHOLAR CONSTRAINTS (MANDATORY)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Every MEM MUST include scholar constraints (RLLs - Recursive Learning Ledgers).

Format: RLL–[NUMBER]: [CONSTRAINT DESCRIPTION]

Constraints MUST be:
• Binding law in Scholar Phase
• Testable against evidence
• Civilization-specific where applicable

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
XII. CITATION & ATTRIBUTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
All sources MUST be:
• Properly attributed
• Verifiably accessible
• Compliant with ARC admissibility rules

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
XIII. VERSION CONTROL & GOVERNANAD
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Version pinning to specific template/ARC versions
• Clear upgrade trails
• Governance violation reporting mechanisms

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
XIV. ARC VERSION PINNING
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Each MEM MUST declare ARC–[CIV] version used.
Mismatch blocks canonical lock.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
XV. COMPLIANCE TIERS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
DRAFT → PARTIAL → COMPLIANT → CANONICAL

CANONICAL: Requires ≥20% quotes with 70% analytical content and EQS compliance

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
XVI. FAILURE MODE ENFORCEMENT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Silent failure is prohibited.
All failures must be declared with reason.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
XVII. LANGUAGE CONSTRAINTS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Forbidden:
• inevitable
• destined
• obvious
• had to

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
XVIII. STORAGE & MIRRORING RULE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file MUST be mirrored verbatim into:
–CIV–CORE–[CIV] (all civilizations)
–CIV–SCHOLAR–[CIV] (all civilizations)
–CIV–INDEX–[CIV] (when applicable)

Any divergence invalidates MEM compliance for that civilization.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
XIX. VERSIONING & LOCK
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Additive upgrades only
• Deletions forbidden
• Canonical lock absolute
