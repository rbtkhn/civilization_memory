I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves Savonarola as **Renaissance Florence's prophetic
interruption**: the Dominican friar who briefly overthrew Medici rule,
imposed theocratic governance, and demonstrated the limits of
humanist secularism.

Savonarola is the **counter-Renaissance within the Renaissance**.

He proves that moral authority without arms can seize power.
He also proves it cannot keep it.

Machiavelli watched. Machiavelli learned.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. FERRARA ORIGINS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Girolamo Savonarola was born in Ferrara in 1452.

Background:
• Grandfather was a court physician
• Early training in philosophy and medicine
• Joined Dominican order at Bologna (1475)
• Rejected humanist culture for prophetic calling

His early sermons failed.
He lacked rhetorical polish.
He was reassigned to Florence in 1490.

There, he found his audience.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. FLORENCE UNDER LORENZO DE' MEDICI
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Lorenzo the Magnificent (1449–1492) represented:
• Medici banking power
• Humanist patronage
• Pagan aesthetics
• Informal tyranny under republican forms

Savonarola preached against this Florence:
• Vanity
• Corruption
• Clerical simony
• Classical idolatry

He claimed prophetic visions.
He predicted divine punishment.

Will Durant captures the contrast:

> "Lorenzo had made Florence the Athens of Italy. Savonarola
> proposed to make it the Jerusalem."
> — Will Durant, *The Renaissance*

The aesthetic city would become the holy city.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. THE PROPHETIC MOMENT (1494)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
In 1494, Charles VIII of France invaded Italy.

Savonarola had prophesied foreign invasion as divine punishment.
When Charles arrived, Savonarola's prophecy appeared vindicated.

Consequences:
• Piero de' Medici (Lorenzo's son) capitulated shamefully
• The Medici were expelled from Florence
• Savonarola negotiated with Charles VIII
• Florence became a theocratic republic

Savonarola's authority was purely charismatic.
He held no office.
He commanded by prophecy.

> "The sword has come upon you, O Italy, even as I foretold."
> — Savonarola, sermon (1494)

Prophecy became power.
But prophecy requires continuous confirmation.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. THE BONFIRE OF THE VANITIES (1497)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
On February 7, 1497, Savonarola's followers burned "vanities"
in the Piazza della Signoria:

Items destroyed:
• Mirrors
• Cosmetics
• Playing cards
• Musical instruments
• "Lascivious" paintings
• Classical books
• Works by Boccaccio

This was cultural revolution.
Renaissance Florence repudiated the Renaissance.

Durant's assessment:

> "What was destroyed we cannot know, but the loss to art
> may have been considerable. Botticelli is said to have
> contributed some of his paintings."
> — Will Durant, *The Renaissance*

The bonfire was Savonarola's power made visible.
It was also his overreach made visible.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. CONFLICT WITH ALEXANDER VI
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Pope Alexander VI (Rodrigo Borgia) was everything Savonarola
condemned: corrupt, worldly, nepotistic, simoniac.

Savonarola's denunciations:

> "Rome is a harlot. The Church has become a house of
> prostitution. From head to foot there is no soundness in it."
> — Savonarola, sermon

Alexander responded:
• Summoned Savonarola to Rome (refused)
• Excommunicated him (1497)
• Threatened Florence with interdict

Savonarola initially defied the excommunication.
He continued preaching.
He appealed to a general council over the pope.

This was a gamble that required ongoing Florentine support.

See: MEM–ROME–ITALY–BORGIA

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. THE TRIAL BY FIRE (1498)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
A Franciscan friar challenged a Dominican to prove Savonarola's
prophecies by ordeal: both would walk through fire.

If the Dominican survived, Savonarola was a true prophet.
If not, a false one.

On April 7, 1498, crowds gathered in the Piazza della Signoria.

The ordeal never happened:
• Disputes over conditions
• Rain
• Hours of delay
• The crowd dispersed angry

Savonarola's momentum collapsed.
Prophecy requires events.
When the fire did not prove him, nothing did.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VIII. ARREST, TORTURE, EXECUTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Florentine government arrested Savonarola the next day.

Under torture, he confessed to false prophecy.
He later recanted the confession.
The pattern repeated.

On May 23, 1498, Savonarola was hanged and burned in the
Piazza della Signoria — the same square where the Bonfire
of the Vanities had occurred.

Durant notes the scene:

> "A crowd that had once followed him with devotion now
> watched his execution in silence, or with insults. Florence
> returned to its sins with relief."
> — Will Durant, *The Renaissance*

The theocratic republic lasted four years.
The Medici would return.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IX. MACHIAVELLI'S VERDICT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Niccolò Machiavelli observed Savonarola's rise and fall.

His conclusion was structural:

> "All armed prophets have conquered, and unarmed ones failed.
> For the nature of peoples is variable, and it is easy to
> persuade them of something, but difficult to hold them in
> that persuasion. And therefore things must be so ordered
> that when they no longer believe, they can be made to
> believe by force."
> — Machiavelli, *The Prince*, ch. 6

Savonarola is Machiavelli's case study in **unarmed prophecy**.

Moral authority can seize power.
Only arms can keep it.

See: MEM–ROME–ITALY–LIT–MACHIAVELLI

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
X. MEARSHEIMER SHARPENING
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Structural analysis:

**What Savonarola reveals:**
• Charismatic authority can displace material power — temporarily
• Prophecy requires continuous event-validation
• External invasion (France) enabled internal revolution
• The Papacy remained the structural arbiter — excommunication worked

**What he conceals:**
• Florence's commercial elite never fully submitted
• Savonarola had no military capacity
• The theocratic republic depended on French protection
• When France withdrew, Savonarola was exposed

Moral authority without material backing is **structurally unstable**.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
XI. CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Savonarola encodes **the counter-Renaissance possibility**.

Lessons:
• Moral revulsion can mobilize political power
• Prophecy is power with an expiration date
• Theocracy is unstable without coercion
• The Renaissance was not culturally unanimous
• Machiavelli's realism emerged from Savonarola's failure

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
XII. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Florence chose beauty over holiness — but not unanimously.
• Prophecy works until it doesn't.
• Unarmed prophets fail.
• The Bonfire of the Vanities was a counter-Renaissance within Florence.
• Machiavelli's *Prince* is partly a response to Savonarola.

Tension preserved without verdict.
