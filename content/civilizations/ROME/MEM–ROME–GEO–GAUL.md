I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves **Gaul (Gallia)** as one of Rome’s decisive
civilizational laboratories: a space where conquest, law, urbanization,
and identity transformation were fused into a durable provincial order.

Gaul is not merely conquered territory.
It is **Rome’s proof-of-concept** for large-scale provincial absorption.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

II. ANCIENT GEOGRAPHIC & ETHNOGRAPHIC FOUNDATIONS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Roman understanding of Gaul begins as ethnography, not abstraction.

Julius Caesar defines Gaul through administrative division:

> “All Gaul is divided into three parts, one of which the Belgae inhabit,
> another the Aquitani, the third those who in their own language are
> called Celts, in our language Gauls. All these differ from each other
> in language, customs, and laws.”
> — Julius Caesar, *Commentarii de Bello Gallico* I.1 (trans. Edwards)

Strabo reinforces Gaul’s geographic legibility:

> “The country of the Gauls is divided by rivers and mountains into many
> regions, but it is fertile, well-watered, and capable of sustaining
> great populations; hence it was not difficult for the Romans, once
> they had subdued it, to introduce orderly government.”
> — Strabo, *Geographica* IV.1

Gaul’s terrain invites administration.

III. CONQUEST AS CIVILIZATIONAL RECODING
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Roman conquest in Gaul is not annihilation but **recoding**.

Caesar records the shift from resistance to incorporation:

> “When these matters were reported to Caesar, he hastened into Gaul,
> and by his arrival restored confidence to the Roman allies, restrained
> the wavering, and brought the disaffected back to obedience.”
> — Caesar, *Bellum Gallicum* VII.90

Obedience replaces extermination.
Confidence replaces terror.

IV. PUBLIC-DOMAIN SCHOLARSHIP — PROVINCIAL ABSORPTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Edward Gibbon observes:

> “The manners, language, and even the religion of the Gauls were
> insensibly assimilated to those of their conquerors; and the posterity
> of the Celtic warriors became peaceful subjects and useful citizens
> of the Roman Empire.”
> — Gibbon, *Decline and Fall*, ch. 38

Theodor Mommsen adds:

> “Nowhere did the Roman provincial system operate with more success
> than in Gaul, where the municipal organization struck deep root and
> produced a Roman society more stable than that of Italy itself.”
> — Mommsen, *History of Rome*

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. MODERN SCHOLARSHIP — INTERPRETIVE FRAMING
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Anthony Goldsworthy writes:

> “Gaul mattered not simply because it was conquered, but because it
> became Roman—producing soldiers, administrators, and emperors who
> sustained the Empire long after Italy ceased to do so.”
> — Goldsworthy, *In the Name of Rome*

Peter Heather notes:

> “The western Roman world did not collapse evenly; regions like Gaul
> retained Roman social structures, law, and identity well into the
> post-imperial centuries.”
> — Heather, *The Fall of the Roman Empire*

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. URBANIZATION, LAW, AND IDENTITY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Gaul’s Romanization is institutional:

• Grid cities (Lugdunum, Narbo)
• Roman law courts
• Latin literacy
• Veteran settlement
• Imperial cult participation

Roman identity becomes locally reproduced.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. POST-IMPERIAL AFTERLIFE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
After imperial withdrawal, Gaul retains Roman grammar:

• Law persists
• Bishops replace governors
• Cities endure as power nodes

Gaul becomes Francia, not rupture.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VIII. LIMITS & DISCLOSURES
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Romanization was uneven
• Violence preceded integration
• Local identities persisted beneath Roman forms

No doctrine asserted.
Contradictions preserved.
