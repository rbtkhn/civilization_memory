CREATION NOTE (v2.0) — PHASE II COMPLIANT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This MEM is created under CIV–SCHOLAR–ROME v2.3 (Phase II).

Analytical frame:
• The Third Punic War as Rome's transition from defensive to
  annihilatory imperialism
• "Carthago delenda est" as preventive war doctrine
• Why Rome destroyed rather than absorbed Carthage
• Scipio Aemilianus and Roman awareness of cyclical fate

Contrast with RLL–ROME–0006:
Unlike the fragment pattern (multiple claimants to inheritance),
Rome PREVENTED Carthaginian inheritance by total destruction.
This MEM explores why Rome chose annihilation over absorption.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves the Third Punic War as **Rome's deliberate
elimination of a potential rival**: the conflict in which Rome,
no longer facing existential threat, chose to destroy Carthage
rather than absorb, subordinate, or tolerate it.

The Third Punic War teaches Rome that **survival is not enough**.
Potential rivals must be eliminated before they can recover.

This marks Rome's transition from defensive power to hegemonic power —
from a state that endures threats to a state that prevents them.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. CARTHAGE AFTER ZAMA (201–149 BC)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Treaty of Zama (201 BC) ended the Second Punic War.

Terms:
• Carthage surrendered Spain and Mediterranean islands
• Carthage paid massive war indemnity (10,000 talents over 50 years)
• Carthage retained African territory but no military independence
• Carthage could not wage war without Roman permission

For fifty years, Carthage complied.

Remarkably, Carthage recovered economically. The indemnity was paid
early. Carthaginian commerce flourished. The city regained prosperity
without military power.

Livy notes Roman observers' concern:

> "The Carthaginians, though stripped of empire and ships, seemed to
> grow richer by peace than they had been by war; and this prosperity,
> won without arms, troubled certain Romans more than their former
> conquests had done."
> — Livy, *Ab Urbe Condita*, Book XXXIII (summary)

Carthage was no longer a threat.
It remained a **possibility**.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. CATO AND THE DELENDA EST DOCTRINE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Marcus Porcius Cato (Cato the Elder) visited Carthage in 153 BC as
part of a Roman embassy.

What he saw alarmed him: a prosperous city, recovering population,
fertile hinterland, commercial networks intact. Carthage had no army,
but it had the capacity to rebuild one.

Cato's response was the **delenda est** doctrine:

> "Ceterum censeo Carthaginem esse delendam."
> ("Furthermore, I am of the opinion that Carthage must be destroyed.")

Plutarch records that Cato concluded every Senate speech — regardless
of topic — with this phrase:

> "Whether the subject was corn supply or provincial administration or
> public works, Cato would end by saying: 'And Carthage must be destroyed.'
> When asked why, he would produce fresh figs from his toga, still moist
> from their journey, and say: 'These figs were picked three days ago in
> Carthage. See how close the enemy lies.'"
> — Plutarch, *Life of Cato the Elder*, 27

The delenda est doctrine was **preventive war logic**:
• Carthage was not currently threatening Rome
• Carthage might threaten Rome again if it recovered
• Therefore Carthage must be destroyed before it could recover

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. MEARSHEIMER SHARPENING: THE PREVENTIVE WAR CALCULUS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Mercouris reading frames Roman destruction of Carthage as cultural
hostility, civilizational incompatibility, or irrational hatred
accumulated over generations of conflict.

The realist sharpening asks: **What structural logic drove annihilation?**

Structural analysis:

1. **Relative power trajectory**
   Carthage was recovering economically. Rome's advantage would
   diminish over time if Carthage was permitted to regain strength.
   Preventive war now was cheaper than defensive war later.

2. **Uncertainty problem**
   Rome could not know Carthage's future intentions. Even if current
   Carthaginians were peaceful, future generations might not be.
   Hannibal's invasion remained in living memory. Uncertainty about
   intentions favored elimination.

3. **Demonstration effect**
   Destroying Carthage would demonstrate to other states (Greece,
   Macedon, Syria) that Rome would eliminate any rival that posed
   potential threat. Deterrence through example.

4. **Absorption was risky**
   Incorporating Carthage as a subordinate ally (the citizenship
   model) would have left Carthaginian identity, networks, and
   resentments intact. Rome calculated that absorption was riskier
   than elimination.

> "The destruction of Carthage was not irrational. It was the logical
> conclusion of a strategic calculation: better to eliminate a potential
> rival now than to fight it again when it had recovered."
> — Arthur Eckstein, *Mediterranean Anarchy, Interstate War, and the
> Rise of Rome* (2006)

The polyphonic tension:
• Mercouris: Destruction as cultural hostility and accumulated hatred
• Mearsheimer: Destruction as rational preventive war under uncertainty

Both are valid. Rome destroyed Carthage from BOTH hatred AND calculation.
The hatred made destruction politically feasible; the calculation made
it strategically rational.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. THE PRETEXT AND THE WAR (149–146 BC)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Rome manufactured a pretext.

Numidia (a Roman client state under Masinissa) repeatedly raided
Carthaginian territory. When Carthage finally defended itself
militarily in 150 BC, Rome declared this a treaty violation —
Carthage had waged war without Roman permission.

The Third Punic War began in 149 BC.

Roman demands escalated deliberately:
• First: Surrender hostages → Carthage complied
• Then: Surrender all weapons → Carthage complied
• Finally: Abandon the city and relocate inland → Carthage refused

Appian records Carthaginian desperation:

> "When the Romans demanded that they abandon their city and rebuild
> ten miles from the sea, the Carthaginians, seeing they were to be
> destroyed regardless of compliance, resolved to resist to the end,
> knowing they would die but preferring death with honor to slow
> extinction by Roman design."
> — Appian, *Punic Wars*, VIII.92

The final demand was **designed to be refused**.
Rome wanted war. Carthage's resistance justified annihilation.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. SIEGE AND DESTRUCTION (149–146 BC)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The siege lasted three years.

Carthage, disarmed and without allies, improvised:
• Women cut their hair for bowstrings
• Temples were stripped for metal
• Harbor was fortified with desperate ingenuity

Initial Roman commanders failed. In 147 BC, Scipio Aemilianus
(adopted grandson of Scipio Africanus) took command.

Scipio systematically reduced the city:
• Cut off the harbor
• Stormed the walls
• Fought street by street

In spring 146 BC, Carthage fell.

Appian describes the final assault:

> "The city burned for seventeen days. Scipio, looking upon the flames,
> wept and quoted Homer: 'A day will come when sacred Troy shall perish,
> and Priam and his people.' When asked what he meant, he said: 'I fear
> that someday the same doom will be pronounced upon my own country.'"
> — Appian, *Punic Wars*, VIII.132

Scipio destroyed Carthage — and knew Rome might suffer the same fate.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. SCIPIO'S TEARS: CYCLICAL AWARENESS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Scipio Aemilianus wept at Carthage's destruction.

This is one of antiquity's most analyzed moments. The Roman general,
victorious, weeps for his defeated enemy and fears for his own city.

Polybius, who stood beside Scipio, recorded the scene:

> "Scipio, beholding the city utterly perishing before his eyes, is
> said to have wept openly, lamenting the fate of the enemy. After
> reflecting a long while, he perceived that all cities and nations
> and empires must, like men, meet their doom."
> — Polybius, *Histories*, XXXVIII.22

The tears encode **cyclical awareness**:
• Victory is temporary
• Empires rise and fall
• What Rome did to Carthage, others might do to Rome

This is Rome's first recorded acknowledgment of its own mortality.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VIII. AFTERMATH: AFRICA BECOMES ROMAN
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Carthage was destroyed absolutely:
• The city was burned
• The surviving population was enslaved (~50,000)
• The site was ritually cursed
• Salt was allegedly sown on the ground (possibly apocryphal)
• The territory became the Roman province of Africa

One hundred years later, Julius Caesar founded a Roman colony on the
site. The curse was lifted. Carthage became Roman Carthage — but the
Punic civilization was extinct.

There were no Carthaginian claimants to inheritance.
There was no fragment competition.
Rome had **closed the vacancy** before it opened.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IX. WHY DESTRUCTION, NOT ABSORPTION?
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The citizenship model (MEM–ROME–LAW–CITIZENSHIP) made conquered
peoples into Romans. Why not Carthage?

Possible explanations:

1. **Civilizational incompatibility**
   Carthage was Phoenician, not Italic. Different language, religion,
   culture, political tradition. Rome absorbed Italic peoples more
   easily than non-Italic ones.

2. **Strategic geography**
   Carthage controlled the central Mediterranean. A subordinate
   Carthage might rebel and threaten Roman sea lanes. Italy's
   municipal structure was landlocked and manageable; Carthage's
   maritime network was not.

3. **Accumulated hostility**
   Three generations of war created hatred that made absorption
   politically impossible. Roman voters wanted destruction, not
   integration.

4. **Demonstration effect**
   Absorption would have shown that Rome tolerated rivals. Destruction
   showed that Rome eliminated them. The latter message was more
   useful for deterrence.

> "Carthage could not be absorbed because it could not be trusted.
> Rome had absorbed peoples who submitted; Carthage had fought to the
> end three times. The citizenship model required compliance that
> Carthage had never shown."
> — William V. Harris, *War and Imperialism in Republican Rome* (1979)

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
X. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Prevention is cheaper than defense.
• Potential rivals must be eliminated, not merely defeated.
• Absorption requires compliance; destruction requires only power.
• Victory carries the seeds of future defeat (Scipio's tears).
• Rome closed Carthage's vacancy before it could open.

POLYPHONIC TENSIONS (v2.0):
• Rome destroyed Carthage from hatred AND calculation.
• Scipio wept for Carthage AND ensured its annihilation.
• Rome absorbed most enemies AND destroyed this one.
• Preventive war was rational AND morally corrosive.

Tension preserved without verdict.

  of Scipio Aemilianus by adoption
• MEM–ROME–HANNIBAL — Rome's greatest enemy; memory that drove delenda est
• MEM–ROME–REPUBLIC — system that chose annihilation over absorption
• MEM–ROME–LAW–CITIZENSHIP — absorption mechanism NOT applied to Carthage
• MEM–ROME–CATO — author of delenda est doctrine
• MEM–ROME–GEO–SICILY — hinge of Punic conflicts
• MEM–ROME–HIST–POLYBIUS — eyewitness to Scipio's tears

GEO (≥2):
• MEM–ROME–GEO–MEDITERRANEAN–SEA — Carthage controlled central basin
• MEM–ROME–GEO–AFRICA — territory absorbed after destruction

Cross-civilizational:
• MEM–RUSSIA–WAR–NAPOLEON–BORODINO — parallel: total war logic
• MEM–PERSIA–CARTHAGE — Phoenician heritage; eastern connections

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
XII. SCHOLAR CONSTRAINTS (RLLs)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This MEM provides a **contrast case** for the fragment thesis.

Per RLL–ROME–0006 (Fragment Inheritance): Universal authority cannot
be wholly inherited after collapse; multiple claimants hold fragments.

Rome **prevented** the fragment pattern for Carthage by:
• Total destruction of the city
• Enslavement of the population
• Extinction of Punic political identity
• Closure of potential vacancy before it opened

Carthage left no fragments because Rome left no Carthage.
