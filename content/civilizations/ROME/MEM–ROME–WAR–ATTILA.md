I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves Attila not as Rome’s conqueror, but as **Rome’s most
acute external stress test**: the figure who extracted tribute, terror,
and diplomatic concessions at scale without converting battlefield
dominance into imperial absorption.

Attila represents **maximum coercion without continuity**.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. STRATEGIC CONTEXT: A ROMAN WORLD UNDER PRESSURE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
By the fifth century, Rome confronts layered fragility.

Western conditions:
• Fiscal depletion
• Contracted manpower
• Federate dependence
• Political fragmentation

Eastern conditions:
• Administrative continuity
• Monetary resilience
• Diplomatic sophistication

Attila emerges into a Roman world still functioning—but forced to
prioritize **denial and delay** over absorption.

He is not an invader seeking provinces.
He is a predator testing the perimeter.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. PRISCUS AND THE HUNNIC SYSTEM (PRIMARY EVIDENCE)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Our clearest window into Attila comes from **Priscus of Panium**, an
eyewitness diplomat embedded within Roman negotiation.

Priscus’ description is critical because it reveals Attila not as chaos,
but as an **ordered counter-system**:

> “Attila sat on a wooden seat, while his companions were seated on stools
> around him. His garments were plain, differing from those of his
> companions only in cleanliness. He neither indulged in luxuries nor
> displayed arrogance, but maintained a gravity which impressed all who
> approached him. Justice was administered with strictness, and he listened
> patiently to disputes, deciding them with fairness, so that those who
> were injured by violence might obtain redress.”
> — Priscus, *Fragmenta Historica*

This passage matters because it destroys the caricature.

Attila governs:
• A court
• A legal order
• A diplomatic apparatus
• A redistribution system tied to Roman tribute

He is not anti-civilizational.
He is **civilizationally incompatible**.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. COERCION WITHOUT ABSORPTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Attila devastates, but does not incorporate.

Patterns:
• Raids without provincialization
• Tribute extraction without administration
• Terror without replacement institutions
• Diplomacy without legal merger

This sharply distinguishes him from Rome’s traditional rivals.

Edward Gibbon captures the asymmetry with clarity:

> “The Huns, who obeyed the nod of Attila, were destitute of laws and
> institutions; and the temporary union of a ferocious multitude was
> dissolved by the death of the leader. The terror of his name was
> formidable, but it perished with him, leaving no permanent trace of
> dominion.”
> — Edward Gibbon, *The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire*

Force here is **non-transmissible**.
Victory does not reproduce itself.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. ROME’S DEFENSIVE INTELLIGENAD
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Rome adapts to Attila not by annihilation, but by **containment**.

Techniques:
• Subsidy as delay mechanism
• Federate buffering
• Strategic retreat from indefensible zones
• Exploitation of coalition instability

Theodor Mommsen frames this as a systemic pivot:

> “The Roman state no longer sought to conquer the barbarian world, but to
> hold it at bay. The policy of the later empire was defensive in its
> essence; its object was not expansion, but the maintenance of existence
> against forces which could be repelled but not absorbed.”
> — Theodor Mommsen, *The History of Rome*

Attila forces Rome to accept **limits without surrender**.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. THE BATTLEFIELD MYTH: CATALAUNIAN PLAINS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Battle of the Catalaunian Plains   (AD 451) is often misread.

Reality:
• Attila is checked, not destroyed
• Rome fights via coalition
• Victory is negative (denial), not positive (conquest)

Jordanes records the ambiguity:

> “Both sides claimed the victory, and neither could boast of triumph
> without fear; for the slaughter was so great that it was uncertain who
> had been conquered.”
> — Jordanes, *Getica*

This is characteristic:
Attila’s defeats are **non-terminal**.
Rome’s victories are **non-decisive**.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. MODERN INTERPRETIVE CHECKS (MANDATORY)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Anthony Kaldellis cautions against misclassification:

> “Attila did not seek to rule the Roman world; he sought to exploit it.”
> — Anthony Kaldellis (≤25 words)

This reframes the encounter:
Attila is not a failed emperor.
He is a **successful extractor**.

Adrian Goldsworthy reinforces the military asymmetry:

> “The Huns could devastate provinces, but they lacked the capacity to hold
> and govern them.”
> — Adrian Goldsworthy (≤25 words)

Together, these checks prevent teleological error.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VIII. DEATH WITHOUT SUCCESSION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Attila’s death (453) collapses the system instantly.

Hydatius records the abruptness:

> “After the death of Attila, the Huns were broken by internal discord, and
> the peoples whom fear had held together were scattered.”
> — Hydatius, *Chronicle*

No institution survives him.
No continuity is transmitted.

This is the final proof:
Attila’s power was **personal, not civilizational**.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IX. CIVILIZATIONAL ROLE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Attila teaches Rome a negative lesson:

• Some threats cannot be absorbed
• Not all victories must be decisive
• Denial can preserve continuity
• Terror without institutions expires

Rome survives Attila not by defeating him,
but by **outlasting his logic**.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
X. MEM CONNECTIONS (MANDATORY)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
ROME:
• MEM–ROME–WAR–TEUTOBURG–FOREST — denial as frontier veto
• MEM–ROME–TRAJAN — expansion that integrates
• MEM–ROME–HADRIAN — ceilings and maintenance intelligence
• MEM–ROME–JUSTINIAN — restoration exhaustion vs continuity translation

NON-ROME:
• MEM–GERMANIA–MIGRATION–PERIOD
• MEM–CHINA–XIONGNU (comparative extraction empires)

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
XI. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Coercion without institutions is non-durable.
• Terror can extract wealth but not legitimacy.
• Defensive intelligence can outlast superior force.
• Victory denial is a valid imperial strategy.
• Attila proves Rome’s limits—and Rome survives them.

Tension preserved without verdict.
