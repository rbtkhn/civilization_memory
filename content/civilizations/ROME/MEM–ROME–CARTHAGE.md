I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves Carthage as **Rome's lost mirror**: a maritime,
commercial, oligarchic civilization whose imperial logic rivaled Rome's
own — and whose destruction enabled Roman uncontested supremacy in the
Mediterranean.

Carthage represents a **viable alternative imperial model**:
networked rather than territorial, commercial rather than civic-military.

Rome does not absorb Carthage.
Rome erases it.

This erasure is the definitive contrast case for Roman civilizational
behavior. Rome absorbed most enemies through citizenship pathways;
Carthage it destroyed utterly. Understanding why requires understanding
both civilizations.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. PHOENICIAN ORIGINS & MARITIME LOGIC
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Carthage emerges from Phoenician colonization as a thalassocratic system.

Founded (traditionally 814 BC) by Tyrian colonists, Carthage inherited
Phoenician commercial culture: navigation, trade networks, craft
production, and loose political confederation.

Its power rests on:
• Trade routes rather than land depth
• Ports rather than provinces
• Wealth extraction rather than civic integration
• Naval control of western Mediterranean chokepoints

Polybius contrasts Carthaginian and Roman foundations directly:

> "The Carthaginians depended chiefly on mercenary forces and the
> resources of commerce, while the Romans drew their strength from
> the citizens themselves, trained to arms and accustomed to obey
> the laws of their country. Hence in danger the Carthaginians were
> hampered by distrust of their soldiers, whereas the Romans were
> sustained by confidence in their own people and institutions."
> — Polybius, *Histories*, Book VI

Carthage is optimized for circulation.
Rome is optimized for replacement.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. POLITICAL–MILITARY ARCHITECTURE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Carthage is governed by an oligarchic commercial elite.

Structural traits:
• **Merchant aristocracy**: Wealth determines political power
• **Contracted military force**: Mercenaries, allied contingents,
  subject levies — no citizen army comparable to Roman legions
• **Weak mass civic participation**: Popular assemblies existed but
  oligarchic councils dominated
• **Strategic caution**: Governing councils prioritized commercial
  interests over territorial expansion

Livy emphasizes the fragility this creates under existential pressure:

> "The Carthaginian state was rich in resources and subtle in counsel,
> but slow in resolve; and when danger demanded swift and united action,
> the jealousy of its leaders and the divided authority of its councils
> proved more harmful than the arms of the enemy."
> — Livy, *Ab Urbe Condita*, Book XXI

Carthage governs well in peace.
It fractures under total war.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. HANNIBAL AS SYSTEMIC OUTLIER
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Hannibal Barca exceeds Carthaginian norms.

He embodies:
• Strategic audacity (Alpine crossing, Italian campaign)
• Personal loyalty networks (army followed him, not Carthage)
• Operational independence (16 years in Italy with minimal support)

Yet Hannibal's excellence exposes Carthage's limits.

Edward Gibbon later frames the contradiction:

> "Carthage produced Hannibal, one of the greatest commanders of antiquity;
> but she wanted the firmness of character and the political institutions
> necessary to second his genius. The republic was unequal to the support
> of a war which demanded not only talents, but perseverance, unity,
> and the steady sacrifices of a nation."
> — Edward Gibbon, *The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire*,
> Chapter XLIV

Carthage can generate genius.
It cannot sustain it.

The Barcid faction (Hamilcar, Hasdrubal, Hannibal) operated almost as
an independent power in Spain, building personal armies and pursuing
private vendettas against Rome. This was possible because Carthaginian
institutions could not control their most capable commanders.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. CIVILIZATIONAL MISALIGNMENT WITH TOTAL WAR
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Carthage is structurally unsuited to annihilatory conflict.

Constraints include:
• **Mercenary unreliability**: Mercenaries fight for pay; when pay
  stops, they revolt (Mercenary War, 241–238 BC)
• **Limited manpower replacement**: No citizen reserve comparable
  to Roman Italian confederation
• **Political hesitation**: Commercial oligarchy resists total
  mobilization that threatens property
• **Absence of mobilized citizen ideology**: No equivalent to Roman
  civic-military identity

Theodor Mommsen identifies this as decisive:

> "Carthage was an empire of wealth and calculation, not of national
> devotion. In the final struggle with Rome, she succumbed less to
> military defeat than to the absence of that moral and civic cohesion
> by which alone prolonged resistance against a resolute adversary
> can be maintained."
> — Theodor Mommsen, *The History of Rome*, Book III

Rome can lose armies.
Carthage cannot lose cohesion.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V.A. MEARSHEIMER SHARPENING: STRUCTURAL COMPETITION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Mercouris reading frames Carthage's defeat as civilizational
inadequacy: a commercial culture that lacked Roman virtue.

The realist sharpening asks: **What structural factors determined
Carthage's defeat regardless of cultural qualities?**

Structural analysis:

1. **Manpower asymmetry**
   Rome commanded ~700,000 military-age males in the Italian
   confederation. Carthage's citizen population was perhaps 200,000,
   supplemented by mercenaries. Rome could absorb Cannae-level losses
   multiple times; Carthage could not replace Zama once.

2. **Alliance structure**
   Roman allies were bound by citizenship pathways and shared identity.
   Carthaginian allies were subjects or mercenaries bound by payment.
   Under stress, Roman allies mostly held; Carthaginian allies defected
   or demanded renegotiation.

3. **Geographic position**
   Rome held interior lines in the central Mediterranean. Carthage's
   position (Africa, Spain, islands) required naval coordination across
   long distances. Roman defeat of Carthaginian navy isolated each
   theater.

4. **Institutional depth**
   Rome's Senate could sustain 23-year war (First Punic) and 17-year
   war (Second Punic) with consistent policy. Carthaginian councils
   oscillated between war and peace factions, undermining commanders.

> "Carthage lost not because it lacked wealth or talent but because
> its political structure could not sustain the level of mobilization
> that Rome achieved. Commercial oligarchies protect property; they
> do not sacrifice it for survival."
> — Arthur Eckstein, *Mediterranean Anarchy, Interstate War, and the
> Rise of Rome* (2006)

The polyphonic tension:
• Mercouris: Carthage lacked Roman civic virtue and cohesion
• Mearsheimer: Carthage's structural position made defeat probable

Both are valid. Carthaginian culture and Carthaginian structure were
mutually reinforcing. Commercial oligarchy produced the culture;
the culture reproduced the oligarchy.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. DESTRUCTION & STRATEGIC ERASURE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Carthage's destruction in 146 BC is deliberate and final.

The Third Punic War (149–146 BC) was not a war of survival for Rome.
Carthage posed no military threat. Rome manufactured pretexts and
escalated demands until Carthage had no choice but resistance.

Outcomes of 146 BC:
• City razed and burned (17 days of fire)
• Population killed or enslaved (~50,000)
• Archives destroyed (Carthaginian records lost)
• Language extinguished (Punic survived only in fragments)
• Site ritually cursed
• Territory became Roman province of Africa
• Memory monopolized by Roman sources

This is not conquest.
It is **preventive annihilation**.

Rome ensures no rival system survives.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. RLL INTEGRATION: VACANCY PREVENTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Per RLL–ROME–0006 (Fragment Inheritance Law):
> Universal authority cannot be wholly inherited after collapse.
> Multiple claimants will each hold fragments.

Carthage is the **contrast case** where Rome prevented this pattern.

When Rome conquered other civilizations (Greece, Egypt, the Hellenistic
kingdoms), it absorbed their elites, preserved their cultures, and
allowed continuity under Roman administration. These civilizations
left "fragments" — cultural, institutional, religious inheritances
that persisted within the Roman system.

Carthage left nothing.

Why the difference?

1. **Civilizational incompatibility**
   Carthage was Phoenician/Semitic, not Greco-Roman. Different language,
   religion (Baal, child sacrifice allegations), culture, political
   tradition. Rome could absorb Greeks because Greeks and Romans shared
   cultural reference points. Carthage was genuinely alien.

2. **Three-war accumulated hostility**
   No other enemy fought Rome three times across 118 years. The hatred
   accumulated. Hannibal's invasion remained in living memory. Roman
   voters wanted destruction, not integration.

3. **Preventive war logic**
   Cato's "delenda est" doctrine: destroy Carthage before it can recover.
   Absorption would leave Carthaginian identity, networks, resentments
   intact. Annihilation eliminated future risk.

4. **Demonstration effect**
   Destroying Carthage signaled to other powers (Greece, Syria, Egypt)
   that Rome would eliminate any rival that posed potential threat.
   Absorption would have suggested tolerance; annihilation suggested
   finality.

Rome closed Carthage's vacancy before it could open.
There were no Carthaginian claimants because there was no Carthage.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VIII. MODERN STRATEGIC ASSESSMENT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Modern historians converge on structural diagnosis.

Adrian Goldsworthy summarizes Carthage's fatal weakness:

> "Carthage was wealthy and sophisticated, but it never developed
> the political or military structures needed to fight a long war
> against Rome, whose strength lay in the endurance of its institutions
> rather than the brilliance of its commanders."
> — Adrian Goldsworthy, *The Fall of Carthage* (2000)

Richard A. Gabriel emphasizes the systemic contrast:

> "Carthage relied on money, alliances, and exceptional individuals.
> Rome relied on systems, discipline, and replacement.
> In wars of exhaustion, systems prevail."
> — Richard A. Gabriel, *Hannibal* (2011)

The outcome is structural, not accidental.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IX. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Carthage represents the road Rome rejected.
• Commercial empires struggle under total war.
• Genius cannot compensate for systemic weakness.
• Rome wins by institutional patience, not brilliance.
• Destruction secures memory as much as territory.
• Annihilation prevents fragment inheritance.
• What Rome did to Carthage, Rome feared others might do to Rome.

POLYPHONIC TENSIONS (v2.0):
• Carthage was a viable alternative AND structurally doomed.
• Hannibal was Carthage's greatest asset AND proof of its limits.
• Commercial wealth enabled power AND prevented total mobilization.
• Rome destroyed Carthage from hatred AND rational calculation.

Tension preserved without verdict.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
XI. SCHOLAR CONSTRAINTS (RLLs)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This MEM is the **definitive contrast case** for RLL–ROME–0006
(Fragment Inheritance Law).

Key constraint: Rome absorbed most conquered civilizations through
citizenship pathways, allowing cultural/institutional fragments to
persist. Carthage was the exception — totally destroyed, leaving no
fragments. Understanding WHY Rome chose annihilation here illuminates
the boundaries of the absorption mechanism.

Factors that triggered annihilation rather than absorption:
• Civilizational incompatibility (non-Greco-Roman)
• Accumulated hostility (three wars)
• Preventive war logic (eliminate future risk)
• Demonstration effect (signal to other powers)
