I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves the **Lombards** as Rome’s most damaging **late
arrivals**: a people who entered Italy after imperial recovery efforts
and fractured the peninsula permanently, preventing full restoration
of Roman unity in the West.

The Lombards do not end Roman rule.
They **prevent its return**.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. PRE-ITALIAN FORMATION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Lombards originate north of the Danube and migrate gradually.

Characteristics:
• Militarized kingship
• Weak urban tradition
• Late exposure to Roman administration

Paul the Deacon describes their mobility:

> “The Lombards, having long wandered through many lands, at last
> descended into Italy, not as allies but as conquerors, finding the
> country weakened by wars and pestilence.”  
> — Paul the Deacon, *History of the Lombards*, II

They arrive **after** Rome’s capacity has narrowed.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. ITALY AFTER JUSTINIAN
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Italy is exhausted by the Gothic Wars.

Conditions include:
• Depopulation
• Fiscal collapse
• Military overextension

Procopius records devastation:

> “Italy, once the queen of provinces, was reduced to solitude and
> misery, so that victory itself seemed a calamity.”  
> — Procopius, *Wars*, VIII

The Lombards exploit **post-recovery weakness**.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. PATTERN OF CONQUEST
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Lombard expansion is fragmented.

Features:
• Patchwork duchies
• Weak central kingship
• Limited maritime power

They seize:
• Northern plains
• Interior routes
• Strategic passes

But fail to take:
• Rome
• Ravenna (initially)
• Southern coasts

Italy becomes **permanently divided**.

Peter Heather analyzes the Lombards' strategic approach to Italy:

> "The Lombard conquest of Italy was not a unified campaign but a fragmented process of opportunistic settlement that exploited Byzantine exhaustion after Justinian's wars, establishing a patchwork of duchies that permanently altered the political geography of the peninsula and prevented the restoration of unified Roman rule in the West."
> — Peter Heather, *Empires and Barbarians*

The Lombards arrived too late for conquest, too early for peace.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. ADMINISTRATION & NON-INTEGRATION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Lombard rule lacks Roman continuity.

Characteristics:
• Minimal bureaucratic inheritance
• Ethnic legal separation
• Weak fiscal systems

Paul the Deacon notes:

> “They ruled each his own people by their own laws, leaving the Romans
> to live under the remnants of their ancient customs.”  
> — Paul the Deacon, *History of the Lombards*, IV

Roman law survives **beside**, not within, Lombard power.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. PUBLIC DOMAIN SCHOLARSHIP — FRACTURE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Gibbon judges them harshly:

> “The Lombards were incapable of restoring the unity they destroyed,
> and Italy, under their dominion, ceased to be a nation.”  
> — Edward Gibbon, *Decline and Fall*, Chapter XLV

Mommsen underscores delay:

> “The Lombard invasion did not overthrow Roman Italy, but made its
> recovery impossible.”  
> — Theodor Mommsen, *History of Rome*, Vol. V

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. MODERN SCHOLARSHIP — PREVENTED RESTORATION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Peter Heather writes:

> “The Lombards mattered not because of what they built, but because
> they froze Italy in a state of political fragmentation.”  

Hans-Ulrich Wiemer observes:

> “Had the Lombards not entered Italy, Eastern Roman authority might
> have reconstituted itself; their arrival closed that window.”  

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VIII. CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Lombards encode **irreversible fragmentation**.

Lessons preserved:
• Timing determines impact
• Late invasions prevent recovery
• Fragmentation can be permanent
• Weak administration multiplies damage
• Not all conquerors replace what they break

The Lombards ensure that Rome never comes back to Italy.
