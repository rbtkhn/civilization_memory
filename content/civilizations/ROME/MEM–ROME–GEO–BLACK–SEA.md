GEO–MEM COGNITIVE DECLARATION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This GEO–MEM expresses MEARSHEIMER STRATEGIC COGNITION.

GEO–MEMs preserve geography as permanent structural constraint.
They answer: "What does this terrain DO to actors within it?"

GEO–MEMs contain:
• Strategic analysis (~2/3): terrain logic, power distribution, structural constraints
• ARC verbatim quotes (~1/3): demonstrating permanent patterns through historical evidence

GEO–MEMs do NOT synthesize civilizational claims or polyphonic tension.
For full civilizational narrative, see subject MEM.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves the Black Sea as **Rome’s outer maritime threshold**:
a semi-integrated zone where Roman law, trade, and military authority
extended beyond the Mediterranean core but never achieved full
interiorization.

For Rome, the Black Sea is not *Mare Nostrum*.
It is **proximate but conditional space**.

The Black Sea represents expansion **without absorption**—a domain
managed for risk, not transformed into civilizational interior.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. HELLENISTIC INHERITANCE & ROMAN ENTRY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Rome does not originate Black Sea order.

Inherited conditions include:
• Greek colonial networks along the coast
• Pontic and Bosporan kingdoms
• Maritime trade circuits independent of Roman administration

Roman entry occurs through:
• The defeat of Mithridates VI
• Client-state arrangements
• Selective provincialization of coastal nodes

Strabo describes the Black Sea as structurally plural and difficult to
stabilize under unified authority:

> “The Pontic regions are inhabited by many peoples and governed in
> different ways, being difficult to hold together under one authority,
> since both land and sea open them to continual change.”
> — Strabo, *Geographica*, Book XI

Rome overlays authority rather than rebuilds the system.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. STRATEGIC FUNCTION: BUFFER, NOT CORE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Black Sea functions as a Roman **strategic buffer zone** rather than
a civilizational core.

Primary roles include:
• Shielding the Balkans and Anatolia
• Monitoring steppe and Caucasus access routes
• Limiting hostile naval penetration

Appian captures Rome’s restraint following the Mithridatic Wars:

> “The Romans did not seek mastery of all lands about the Pontus, but
> aimed to prevent any single power from commanding the sea and thus
> threatening Asia and Greece together.”
> — Appian, *Mithridatic Wars*

Rome manages risk here; it does not seek intimacy.

Duane Roller explains Rome's strategic calculus in the Black Sea region following the Mithridatic Wars:

> "The Romans approached the Black Sea not as a territory to be fully incorporated into their empire, but as a strategic frontier to be contained and monitored. They established client states along the coasts, dismantled the Pontic kingdom that had threatened their eastern provinces, and created a network of alliances that prevented any single power from dominating the entire basin while maintaining Roman naval supremacy."
> — Duane W. Roller, *Empire of the Black Sea: The Rise and Fall of the Mithridatic World*

The Black Sea became Rome's watchful perimeter, not its welcoming harbor.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. ECONOMIC UTILITY WITHOUT DEPENDENCE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Black Sea contributes to Roman power but does not sustain Roman
survival.

Edward Gibbon underscores this asymmetry:

> “The provinces bordering the Euxine were useful rather than essential;
> their loss would diminish the majesty, but not the subsistence, of the
> empire, whose true strength lay elsewhere.”
> — Edward Gibbon, *The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman
> Empire*, Chapter XVII

The region is useful, not vital.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. MILITARY LIMITS & STEPPE PROXIMITY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tacitus articulates Rome’s logic of restraint:

> “There are regions which it is wiser to observe than to possess, for
> conquest would bring neither law nor security, and the very effort to
> hold them would exhaust authority rather than extend it.”
> — Tacitus, *Annals*, Book II

Roman authority stops at the shoreline.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. EASTERN ROME & CONDITIONAL CONTINUITY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Procopius describes the Black Sea’s defensive character:

> “The Pontic Sea served more as a shield than as a possession, guarding
> the approaches to the imperial city while remaining difficult to hold
> in its entirety.”
> — Procopius, *Wars*, Book III

Control remains defensive; integration remains incomplete.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. ALIGNMENT WITH THE MEDITERRANEAN GEOMETRIC ANCHOR
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file is explicitly aligned with **MEM–ROME–GEO–MEDITERRANEAN–SEA**.

Mediterranean:
• Interiorized space
• Dense legal circulation
• Cultural standardization

Black Sea:
• Peripheral interface
• Fragmented authority
• Strategic uncertainty

The Black Sea is Rome’s *outer edge* of maritime logic.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VIII. CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Black Sea encodes **Roman restraint**.

Rome learns where to stop.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IX. RELATED MEM CONNECTIONS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
ROME (Same-Civilization):
• MEM–ROME–GEO–MEDITERRANEAN–SEA — the interiorized sea against which Black Sea
  peripherality is measured; structural contrast for buffer logic.
• MEM–ROME–GEO–DANUBE–RIVER — the land frontier axis connecting Balkan defense
  to Black Sea monitoring; Rome's continental anchor to Pontic exposure.
• MEM–ROME–GEO–ANATOLIA — the landmass shielded by Black Sea buffer function;
  Roman provincial core protected by Pontic periphery.
• MEM–ROME–GEO–AEGEAN–SEA — the intermediate basin connecting Mediterranean
  core to Pontic approaches via straits system.
• MEM–ROME–WAR–MITHRIDATES–VI — the conflict establishing Roman presence in
  Pontus; origin of client-state architecture in Black Sea region.
• MEM–ROME–PONTUS — the kingdom absorbed as client state; primary interface
  between Roman authority and Black Sea littoral.
• MEM–ROME–CONSTANTINOPLE — the city commanding straits access; Eastern Roman
  control node for Pontic maritime traffic.
• MEM–ROME–ARMENIA — the Caucasian buffer state mediating between Roman Black
  Sea interests and Parthian/Persian pressure.
• MEM–ROME–GEO–CASPIAN–SEA — contrasting enclosed basin beyond Roman reach;
  demonstrates limits of Roman maritime extension.
• MEM–ROME–WAR–PERSIA — the eastern rival whose pressure shaped Roman defensive
  posture in Black Sea approaches.

Cross-Civilizational:
• MEM–RUSSIA–GEO–BLACK–SEA — Russian strategic perspective on the same basin;
  demonstrates permanent terrain logic across civilizational succession.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
X. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Not all seas can be interiorized.
• Buffers preserve longevity.
• Exposure defines Roman risk.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
XI. MODERN SCHOLARSHIP (ARC–ROME · COPYRIGHTED)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Adrian Goldsworthy:
> “The Black Sea never became a Roman lake in the way the Mediterranean
> did; it remained a zone of influence rather than integration.”

Peter Heather:
> “Beyond the Danube and the Pontic shores lay political worlds Rome
> could engage but not absorb without unacceptable risk.”

**Duane W. Roller (ADDITIVE — ARC–ROME COMPLIANT):**
> “The Black Sea world was never a single system for Rome, but a
> constellation of maritime corridors, dynastic kingdoms, and inland
> barriers whose geography rewarded resistance and punished attempts at
> uniform control. Roman power there functioned by limitation rather
> than domination.”
> — Duane W. Roller, *Empire of the Black Sea*

Roller clarifies why Roman strategy emphasized **containment and
fragmentation** rather than interiorization.
