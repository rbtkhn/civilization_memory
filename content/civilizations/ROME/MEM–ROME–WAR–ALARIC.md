I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves **Alaric I** as Rome's most consequential Gothic
antagonist: the Visigothic king who sacked Rome in AD 410, ending
eight centuries of the city's inviolability and triggering the
theological crisis that produced Augustine's *City of God*.

Alaric is not a barbarian invader in the simple sense.
He is a **Roman-trained soldier demanding what Rome promised**.

The sack of 410 is not conquest.
It is **negotiation failure weaponized**.

Alaric teaches that Rome fell not to external strength,
but to its own **inability to keep bargains**.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. BIOGRAPHICAL CONTEXT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Alaric was born into the Gothic military aristocracy.

**CHRONOLOGY:**
• Born c. AD 370 (probably in Moesia, within Roman borders)
• Fought under Theodosius I at the Battle of the Frigidus (AD 394)
• Led Gothic foederati in Roman service
• Elected king of the Visigoths (c. AD 395)
• Invaded Greece (AD 395–397)
• Invaded Italy three times (AD 401–402, 408, 410)
• Sacked Rome (August 24, AD 410)
• Died in Calabria (late AD 410)

Alaric spent his entire adult life within the Roman system.
He fought for Rome before he fought against it.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. THE FRIGIDUS AND BROKEN PROMISES
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Alaric's grievance originated in Roman betrayal.

**THE BATTLE OF THE FRIGIDUS (AD 394):**
• Civil war between Theodosius I and the usurper Eugenius
• Gothic foederati placed in the front lines
• Suffered catastrophic casualties (reportedly 10,000 dead)
• Victory won primarily by Gothic blood

Orosius records the cynical calculation:

> "The barbarians fought in the vanguard, and their losses were
> accounted a double victory: they had defeated the enemy and
> diminished their own troublesome allies."
> — Orosius, *Historiae Adversum Paganos*, VII.35

**AFTERMATH:**
• Theodosius died (AD 395)
• Promised rewards (land, positions) not delivered
• Alaric and his people left landless and unpaid
• Gothic federate status became precarious

Alaric's rebellion was not aggression.
It was **contract enforcement by other means**.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. ROMAN POLITICAL DYSFUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Alaric's success depended on Roman failure.

**WESTERN COURT:**
• Honorius: weak emperor, isolated in Ravenna
• Stilicho: capable general, half-Vandal, politically vulnerable
• Court factionalism prioritized purity over competence
• Anti-barbarian sentiment undermined pragmatic policy

**STILICHO'S FALL (AD 408):**
• Stilicho had negotiated with Alaric repeatedly
• Court faction accused him of treasonous collusion
• Stilicho executed (August AD 408)
• His Gothic troops massacred by Roman mobs
• Survivors fled to Alaric

Zosimus describes the consequences:

> "After Stilicho's death, the soldiers who had served under him,
> being barbarians by origin, were murdered throughout Italy by
> the Roman populace, and their wives and children with them.
> Those who escaped this slaughter, numbering some thirty thousand
> men, fled to Alaric and begged him to lead them against their
> murderers."
> — Zosimus, *New History*, V.35

Rome destroyed its own defense to preserve its prejudices.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. THE THREE SIEGES (AD 408–410)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Alaric besieged Rome three times before sacking it.

**FIRST SIEGE (AD 408):**
• Alaric demanded payment for Gothic military services
• Rome initially resisted
• Famine and disease forced negotiation
• Rome paid 5,000 pounds of gold, 30,000 pounds of silver

**SECOND SIEGE (AD 409):**
• Negotiations collapsed again
• Alaric demanded permanent Gothic settlement in Italy
• Rome refused; Alaric withdrew

**THIRD SIEGE (AD 410):**
• Final negotiations failed
• Honorius in Ravenna refused all terms
• Alaric lost patience

Zosimus records Alaric's frustration:

> "Alaric, having been deceived so often by Roman promises, and
> seeing that the emperor would neither fight nor negotiate in
> good faith, resolved to take by force what had been denied by
> treachery."
> — Zosimus, *New History*, V.40

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. THE SACK OF ROME (AUGUST 24, AD 410)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
On August 24, AD 410, the Visigoths entered Rome.

**THE ENTRY:**
• The Salarian Gate was opened (possibly by slaves)
• Gothic forces entered the city
• Three days of plundering followed

**NATURE OF THE SACK:**
• Churches declared sanctuaries (mostly respected)
• Systematic looting of wealth
• Some violence, arson, and rape
• Many buildings spared; city not destroyed
• Population not massacred

Orosius, a Christian apologist, minimizes the damage:

> "The barbarians, though they were pagans, showed more respect for
> the sanctuaries of the apostles than the Romans themselves had
> shown in times past, and many who fled to the churches were
> preserved unharmed."
> — Orosius, *Historiae Adversum Paganos*, VII.39

Jerome, writing from Bethlehem, captures the psychological shock:

> "The city which had conquered the world was itself conquered.
> My voice sticks in my throat, and sobs choke my words as I
> dictate. The city that had taken the whole world was itself
> taken."
> — Jerome, *Letter 127*

The sack lasted three days.
The shock lasted forever.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. WILL DURANT — THE AGE OF FAITH
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Will Durant situates Alaric within Rome's terminal crisis:

> "Alaric was not a barbarian in the usual sense. He had been born
> within the Roman Empire, trained in its armies, and civilized by
> its culture. He did not want to destroy Rome; he wanted a place
> in it. When Rome refused to keep its promises, he took by force
> what negotiation had been denied. The sack of 410 was not the
> triumph of barbarism over civilization, but the failure of
> civilization to honor its own commitments."
> — Will Durant, *The Age of Faith*

On the sack's significance:

> "The fall of Rome to Alaric in 410 was less a military defeat than
> a psychological catastrophe. The city that had ruled the world for
> eight centuries, that had seemed as eternal as the hills, had been
> violated by barbarian hands. The shock to Roman pride was immense;
> pagans blamed Christianity, Christians blamed pagans, and Augustine
> wrote the City of God to explain that Rome's fall was not God's
> failure but man's."
> — Will Durant, *The Age of Faith*

On Alaric's frustrated ambition:

> "Alaric died a few months after his greatest triumph, still seeking
> the African grain lands that might have made his people permanent
> settlers rather than wandering soldiers. His body was buried in
> the bed of the Busento River, and the slaves who dug his grave
> were killed to keep the location secret. The Visigoths moved on,
> still homeless, still searching for a place within the Roman world
> that Rome had never been willing to give them."
> — Will Durant, *The Age of Faith*

Durant identifies Alaric's tragedy: he wanted **inclusion**, not destruction.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VIII. PUBLIC DOMAIN SCHOLARSHIP — GIBBON
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Edward Gibbon treats the sack with his characteristic irony:

> "Eleven hundred and sixty-three years after the foundation of Rome,
> the Imperial city, which had subdued and civilized so considerable
> a part of mankind, was delivered to the licentious fury of the
> tribes of Germany and Scythia."
> — Edward Gibbon, *The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire*

On Alaric's restraint:

> "The Gothic king, who respected the name and sanctity of Rome,
> though he had violated her majesty, gave orders that the churches
> of St. Peter and St. Paul should be considered as sanctuaries,
> and that the lives of those who fled to them should be spared."
> — Edward Gibbon, *The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire*

On the deeper cause:

> "The Romans themselves had invited the calamity which they
> deplored, by the murder of Stilicho and the massacre of his
> barbarian soldiers. The successors of that general proved
> incapable of defending the capital which they had betrayed,
> and Alaric entered Rome less as a conqueror than as an avenger."
> — Edward Gibbon, *The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire*

Gibbon identifies Rome as **author of its own destruction**.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IX. MODERN SCHOLARSHIP — HEATHER AND WIEMER
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Peter Heather emphasizes the structural dynamics:

> "Alaric's sack of Rome was the culmination of fifteen years of
> failed negotiation. The Goths had been promised land, position,
> and security within the Roman system. When those promises were
> broken, Alaric turned to force. The sack was not the triumph of
> barbarism but the failure of Roman diplomacy and the collapse of
> the federate system that had sustained the Western Empire."
> — Peter Heather, *The Fall of the Roman Empire*

Hans-Ulrich Wiemer situates Alaric within the Gothic trajectory:

> "Alaric was the first Gothic leader to understand that the Goths
> could not survive outside the Roman system, and that their only
> future lay in forcing Rome to give them what negotiation could not
> achieve. His sack of Rome was a negotiating tactic that succeeded
> too well—it shocked Rome into paralysis rather than accommodation,
> and left the Goths no better off than before."
> — Hans-Ulrich Wiemer, *Theoderich der Große*

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
X. THEOLOGICAL AFTERMATH — AUGUSTINE'S RESPONSE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The sack of 410 triggered a theological crisis.

**PAGAN ACCUSATION:**
• Rome abandoned the old gods
• Christianity weakened Roman virtue
• The sack proves Christian failure

**CHRISTIAN RESPONSE — AUGUSTINE:**
• Began *City of God* (AD 413)
• Distinguished earthly cities from City of God
• Earthly cities—including Rome—are transient
• Only the City of God is eternal

See: MEM–ROME–CHRISTIANITY–AUGUSTINE

The sack that ended one worldview created another.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
XI. ALARIC'S DEATH AND GOTHIC CONTINUATION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Alaric died within months of his triumph.

**AFTERMATH:**
• Moved south toward Sicily, seeking African grain
• Died in Calabria (late AD 410)
• Buried in the bed of the Busento River
• Slaves who dug the grave were killed

**VISIGOTHIC CONTINUATION:**
• Alaric's brother-in-law Athaulf succeeded him
• Visigoths moved to Gaul, then Spain
• Eventually established kingdom in Aquitaine (AD 418)
• Visigothic kingdom lasted until Arab conquest (AD 711)

Alaric died still seeking what Rome never gave:
a permanent home within the Roman world.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
XII. CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Alaric encodes **negotiation failure as civilizational catastrophe**.

Lessons preserved:
• Rome-trained soldiers become Rome's enemies when promises break
• Purging competent "barbarians" destroys defense capacity
• Weak emperors behind walls cannot negotiate or fight
• The sack was not conquest but contract enforcement
• Psychological shock can exceed material damage
• Broken bargains produce avengers

Alaric teaches that **civilizations die when they cannot keep faith
with those who defend them**.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
XIII. COMPARATIVE MODES
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Alaric contrasts with other late Roman antagonists:

| Figure | Relationship to Rome | Outcome |
|--------|---------------------|---------|
| **Alaric** (AD 410) | Foederatus turned avenger | Sacked Rome, died homeless |
| **Attila** (AD 452) | External conqueror | Turned back from Rome |
| **Gaiseric** (AD 455) | External raider | Thorough sack, no settlement |
| **Theodoric** (AD 493) | Authorized by Constantinople | Ruled Italy as Roman king |
| **Odoacer** (AD 476) | Roman general | Deposed last Western emperor |

Alaric wanted inclusion. Rome's refusal made him destroyer.
