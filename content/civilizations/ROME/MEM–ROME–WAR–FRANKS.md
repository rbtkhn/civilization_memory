I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves the **Franks** as Rome’s most consequential
**internalized barbarian power**: a people who entered the empire as
raiders, stabilized as federates, and ultimately converted Roman
authority into successor sovereignty rather than annihilating it.

The Franks do not shatter Rome.
They **inherit it in fragments**.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. ORIGINS & EARLY CONTACT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Franks emerge along the lower Rhine frontier as a confederation of
Germanic groups.

Early characteristics:
• Loose tribal aggregation
• Riverine mobility
• Opportunistic raiding
• Gradual Romanization through proximity

Ammianus Marcellinus records their frontier pressure:

> “The Franks, a people bold and restless, were continually attempting
> incursions across the Rhine, not always by force of arms, but often
> by treaties treacherously broken, so that the Roman provinces were
> worn down more by repetition than by defeat.”  
> — Ammianus Marcellinus, *Res Gestae*, XVII

The Franks appear early as **manageable enemies**, not existential
threats.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. FEDERATION & INTERNALIZATION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Unlike the Huns or Vandals, the Franks are progressively absorbed.

Roman strategies include:
• Foedus treaties
• Military recruitment
• Land grants in frontier zones
• Use as counterweights against other barbarians

Sidonius Apollinaris observes this normalization:

> “The Frank who once terrified the fields now bears Roman arms and
> defends the frontier he formerly assailed, wearing our uniform and
> receiving our pay.”  
> — Sidonius Apollinaris, *Letters*, V.7

The Franks become **Roman force multipliers**.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. COLLAPSE OF WESTERN IMPERIAL COMMAND
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
As central authority weakens, Frankish leaders accumulate autonomy.

Key developments:
• Hereditary military command
• Control of taxation in assigned regions
• Blending of Roman and Frankish law

Gregory of Tours later preserves the memory of this transition:

> “The kings of the Franks did not destroy the cities they entered, but
> took over their administration, appointing counts and judges after
> the Roman manner.”  
> — Gregory of Tours, *History of the Franks*, II

Power shifts **without institutional rupture**.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. CLOVIS & LEGITIMACY CONVERSION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The reign of Clovis (r. 481–511) marks consolidation.

Key acts:
• Defeat of rival Frankish kings
• Elimination of Roman military remnants
• Conversion to Nicene Christianity

Gregory of Tours records the baptism:

> “Then the king confessed almighty God in the Trinity, and was
> baptized in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, and with
> him more than three thousand of his army.”  
> — Gregory of Tours, *History of the Franks*, II.31

Religion converts **power into legitimacy**.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. PUBLIC DOMAIN SCHOLARSHIP — CONTINUITY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Gibbon emphasizes Frankish pragmatism:

> “The Franks, less ferocious than other barbarians, respected the
> forms of Roman administration, and their victories were followed
> rather by succession than by devastation.”  
> — Edward Gibbon, *Decline and Fall*, Chapter XXXVIII

Mommsen highlights institutional survival:

> “In Gaul the Roman system did not perish with the empire; it passed
> into Frankish hands, and thereby preserved its substance beneath a
> changed sovereignty.”  
> — Theodor Mommsen, *History of Rome*, Vol. V

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. MODERN SCHOLARSHIP — SUCCESSOR LOGIC
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Peter Heather writes:

> “The Franks succeeded where others failed because they entered the
> Roman system early and deeply, making their rise a transformation
> rather than a collapse.”  

Hans-Ulrich Wiemer notes:

> “Frankish power represents not barbarian destruction, but the
> political afterlife of Roman rule in the West.”  

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VIII. CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Franks encode **adaptive succession**.

Lessons preserved:
• Federation enables continuity
• Insider barbarians outlast external conquerors
• Law survives through translation
• Religion stabilizes political inheritance
• Collapse can be evolutionary

The Franks end Rome by becoming it.
