I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves Capua as **Rome's most consequential Italian
defector**: the wealthy Campanian city whose alliance with Hannibal
(216 BC) tested the limits of Roman absorption, and whose brutal
punishment demonstrated that Rome would destroy what it could not hold.

Capua proves that **citizenship without loyalty is revocable**.

After Cannae, Capua calculated that Rome was finished.
Rome survived. Capua did not.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

II. CAPUA BEFORE ROME
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Capua was the wealthiest city in Italy outside Rome.

**BACKGROUND:**
• Founded by Etruscans (c. 600 BC)
• Located in Campania's fertile plain
• Major agricultural and commercial center
• Population possibly rivaling Rome before absorption
• Known for luxury, gladiatorial schools, bronze-work

**ABSORPTION INTO ROME (343–338 BC):**
• Samnite pressure drove Capua to seek Roman alliance
• First Samnite War (343–341 BC) secured Roman protection
• Latin War (340–338 BC) confirmed Capuan status
• Capua received *civitas sine suffragio* (citizenship without vote)

Livy describes Capua's wealth:

> "Capua was at that time the wealthiest city in Italy, rich in
> fertile lands, favored by sea and climate, and softened by its
> very prosperity. Its citizens were renowned for luxury no less
> than for commerce, and the gladiatorial games held there were
> the most famous in Italy."
> — Livy, *Ab Urbe Condita*, Book XXIII

Capua was Rome's most valuable Italian partner—and its most dangerous.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. THE DEFECTION (216 BC)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
After Cannae, Capua defected to Hannibal.

**CONTEXT:**
• Rome had lost perhaps 70,000 men at Cannae
• Hannibal appeared invincible
• Southern Italian allies were wavering
• Capua saw opportunity for independence

**CALCULATION:**
• If Rome fell, Capua would be premier Italian city
• Hannibal promised Capua primacy in post-Roman Italy
• Capuan aristocracy resented Roman oversight
• Commercial interests aligned with Carthaginian Mediterranean

Livy records the Capuan ambassador's reasoning:

> "Capua will be the head of Italy, as she deserves by her wealth
> and power. Under Roman rule we have been subjects; under Hannibal
> we shall be partners in empire."
> — Livy, *Ab Urbe Condita*, Book XXIII.10

**HANNIBAL'S TERMS:**
• No Carthaginian magistrate to have authority over Capuans
• No Capuan to serve in Carthaginian forces unwillingly
• Capua to have its own laws and magistrates

Capua received better terms than any Roman ally had ever held.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. HANNIBAL'S WINTER (216–215 BC)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Hannibal wintered in Capua after Cannae.

Ancient sources blame Capuan luxury for Carthaginian decline:

> "Hannibal's army, which no force of arms had been able to break,
> was broken by the vices of Capua. The soldiers who had endured
> hunger and cold in the Alps could not resist warmth, wine, and
> women. When spring came, they marched out a different army—
> softened, enfeebled, and no longer the men who had conquered
> at Cannae."
> — Livy, *Ab Urbe Condita*, Book XXIII.18

**MODERN ASSESSMENT:**
Scholars debate whether Capua actually weakened Hannibal's army.
Structural factors (lack of reinforcement, siege equipment, strategic
stalemate) may explain Carthaginian decline better than moral corruption.

The "Capuan winter" became Roman propaganda:
Luxury destroys armies; Rome's austerity explains its victory.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. THE SIEGE AND FALL (212–211 BC)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Rome besieged Capua despite Hannibal's presence in Italy.

**SIEGE (212–211 BC):**
• Roman forces surrounded Capua with double walls
• Hannibal could not break the siege
• Hannibal marched on Rome itself to force relief
• Rome refused to withdraw: "Hannibal ad portas" failed
• Capua surrendered (211 BC)

Livy records the Roman refusal to panic:

> "When Hannibal appeared before the walls of Rome, hoping to draw
> off the armies besieging Capua, the Senate did not recall a single
> soldier. The land on which Hannibal's camp stood was sold at auction
> the next day, and fetched its full price. Rome showed that she
> feared nothing."
> — Livy, *Ab Urbe Condita*, Book XXVI.11

Capua fell when Hannibal could not protect it.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. THE PUNISHMENT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Rome destroyed Capua as a political entity.

**TERMS:**
• Capuan senate (70 members) executed
• Leading citizens imprisoned or exiled
• Population sold into slavery or dispersed
• City not destroyed physically but stripped of autonomy
• Territory became *ager publicus* (public land)
• Capua ceased to exist as a self-governing community

Livy records the severity:

> "The Senate decreed that the leading men of Capua should be
> scourged and beheaded. Their wives and children were sold into
> slavery. The commons were distributed among other communities.
> Capua was to remain a dwelling-place for farmers and artisans,
> but never again to be a city with magistrates or senate or
> assembly of the people."
> — Livy, *Ab Urbe Condita*, Book XXVI.16

**MEARSHEIMER SHARPENING:**
The punishment was not emotional vengeance. It was structural:
• Demonstration effect for other wavering allies
• Removal of potential future threat
• Conversion of enemy assets (land, population) into Roman resources
• Signal that defection was irreversible

Rome destroyed Capua's political identity to preserve Italy's.

VII. PUBLIC DOMAIN SCHOLARSHIP — MOMMSEN
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Theodor Mommsen frames Capua within Rome's alliance system:

> "Capua was the test case for Roman federalism. The city had
> received nearly everything it asked—wealth, protection, local
> autonomy—and still defected when opportunity arose. Rome's
> punishment was correspondingly severe, for if Capua could
> defect with impunity, no ally could be trusted. The destruction
> of Capuan self-government was not cruelty but policy."
> — Theodor Mommsen, *The History of Rome*, Book III

On the structural logic:

> "Rome could forgive enemies who submitted; she could not forgive
> allies who betrayed. The distinction was fundamental. Enemies
> became friends through defeat; traitors remained traitors forever.
> Capua learned that Roman citizenship was a contract, and that
> contracts broken were contracts cancelled."
> — Theodor Mommsen, *The History of Rome*, Book III

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VIII. MODERN SCHOLARSHIP — GOLDSWORTHY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Adrian Goldsworthy situates Capua within the Second Punic War:

> "Capua's defection was Hannibal's greatest diplomatic success
> in Italy, but it proved a strategic liability. Defending Capua
> tied down Carthaginian forces that might have been used more
> aggressively elsewhere. When Rome besieged the city, Hannibal
> had to try to relieve it—and his failure demonstrated the limits
> of his power in Italy."
> — Adrian Goldsworthy, *The Fall of Carthage*

On the punishment:

> "The destruction of Capua as a political entity was Rome's
> message to all of Italy: defection had consequences. The
> harshness was deliberate and calculated. Other cities that
> had wavered returned to Roman allegiance; none defected
> thereafter. Capua's fate held the alliance together."
> — Adrian Goldsworthy, *The Fall of Carthage*

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IX. CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Capua encodes **alliance limits and defection consequences**.

Lessons preserved:
• Citizenship is a contract; betrayal cancels it
• Wealthy allies can still defect if incentives shift
• Punishment must be exemplary to deter others
• Demonstration effects hold alliances together
• Political destruction is cheaper than military occupation
• Rome absorbed enemies but destroyed traitors

Capua teaches that **alliance systems require enforcement**.
