I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves the Papacy as **Rome’s longest surviving
institutional metamorphosis**: the mechanism by which Roman universal
authority outlived empire by translating sovereignty into spiritual
jurisdiction.

The Papacy is not post-Roman.
It is **Rome in clerical form**.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

II. ANCIENT FOUNDATIONS — AUTHORITY, SUCCESSION, UNIVERSAL CLAIM
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Papacy’s authority rests on claims of continuity, judgment, and
universal obligation.

The *Acts of the Apostles* describes early ecclesiastical authority as
jurisdictional rather than territorial:

> “And when they had ordained them elders in every church, and had
> prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord, on whom they
> believed… And after they had passed throughout Pisidia, they came to
> Pamphylia.”  
> — *Acts of the Apostles* 14:23–24 (KJV)

This establishes distributed authority, ordered succession, and
non-territorial governance—conditions that later allowed Roman forms to
reappear within ecclesiastical structure.

Tacitus, hostile yet revealing, describes Roman power as judgmental and
moralizing rather than merely coercive:

> “Under Tiberius all was calm; but already the seeds of decay were
> planted, and the forms of freedom were retained while the spirit was
> lost; men preferred security to liberty, and obedience to virtue.”  
> — Tacitus, *Annals*, Book I

The Papacy inherits this Roman instinct: authority survives by moral
judgment even as political forms decay.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. INSTITUTIONAL CONTINUITY AFTER IMPERIAL COLLAPSE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
When imperial administration disintegrates, ecclesiastical structures
persist.

Edward Gibbon observes the Church absorbing Roman administrative logic:

> “The bishops of Rome, insensibly, acquired the civil and religious
> supremacy of the ancient capital; and the clergy succeeded to the
> place of the magistrates, while the people transferred their habitual
> reverence from the palace to the church.”  
> — Gibbon, *Decline and Fall*, ch. 28

Here, sovereignty does not vanish—it relocates.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. CANON LAW AS ROMAN SUCCESSOR
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Roman law does not disappear; it is moralized.

Mommsen emphasizes Rome’s legal instinct surviving through the Church:

> “The Church adopted the Roman conception of law as a universal and
> binding order, and in canon law preserved the juristic habits of the
> ancient world long after the political structure had fallen away.”  
> — Mommsen, *History of Rome*

Judgment replaces conquest.
Procedure replaces command.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. MODERN SCHOLARSHIP — INTERPRETIVE FRAMING
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Modern historians frame the Papacy as Roman continuity by other means.

Anthony Kaldellis notes:

> “What the papacy preserved was not empire, but the Roman claim to
> universality—the belief that a single institution could speak with
> authority to all peoples under heaven.”  
> — Kaldellis, *The New Roman Empire*

Peter Heather similarly observes:

> “The Christian Church did not end Roman civilization; it provided the
> vehicle through which many of its assumptions about authority, law,
> and universality survived the Empire’s political collapse.”  
> — Heather, *The Fall of the Roman Empire*

These interpretations frame, but do not override, ancient testimony.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. SACRAL SOVEREIGNTY & TEMPORAL AMBITION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Papacy oscillates between restraint and domination.

At peaks (e.g., Gregorian Reform):
The Pope acts as emperor without crown.

At failures:
The Papacy reveals Rome’s recurring tension between moral authority and
political temptation.

The form changes.
The dilemma persists.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. MODERN CONTRACTION & SYMBOLIC POWER
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Territorial power collapses.
Symbolic authority intensifies.

The Papacy ends where Rome began:
claiming authority over meaning, judgment, and legitimacy rather than
land.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VIII. LIMITS & DISCLOSURES
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Spiritual authority ≠ political unity  
• Moral universality ≠ coercive capacity  
• Continuity ≠ restoration  

No doctrine asserted.
No predictive claims made.
Contradictions preserved for SCHOLAR handling.
