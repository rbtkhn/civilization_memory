I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves the Papacy as **Rome’s longest surviving
institutional metamorphosis**: the mechanism by which Roman universal
authority outlived empire by translating sovereignty into spiritual
jurisdiction.

The Papacy is not post-Roman.
It is **Rome in clerical form**.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. ANCIENT FOUNDATIONS — AUTHORITY, SUCCESSION, UNIVERSAL CLAIM
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Papacy’s authority rests on claims of continuity, judgment, and
universal obligation.

The *Acts of the Apostles* describes early ecclesiastical authority as
jurisdictional rather than territorial:

> “And when they had ordained them elders in every church, and had
> prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord, on whom they
> believed… And after they had passed throughout Pisidia, they came to
> Pamphylia.”  
> — *Acts of the Apostles* 14:23–24 (KJV)

This establishes distributed authority, ordered succession, and
non-territorial governance—conditions that later allowed Roman forms to
reappear within ecclesiastical structure.

Tacitus, hostile yet revealing, describes Roman power as judgmental and
moralizing rather than merely coercive:

> “Under Tiberius all was calm; but already the seeds of decay were
> planted, and the forms of freedom were retained while the spirit was
> lost; men preferred security to liberty, and obedience to virtue.”  
> — Tacitus, *Annals*, Book I

The Papacy inherits this Roman instinct: authority survives by moral
judgment even as political forms decay.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. INSTITUTIONAL CONTINUITY AFTER IMPERIAL COLLAPSE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
When imperial administration disintegrates, ecclesiastical structures
persist.

Edward Gibbon observes the Church absorbing Roman administrative logic:

> “The bishops of Rome, insensibly, acquired the civil and religious
> supremacy of the ancient capital; and the clergy succeeded to the
> place of the magistrates, while the people transferred their habitual
> reverence from the palace to the church.”  
> — Gibbon, *Decline and Fall*, ch. 28

Here, sovereignty does not vanish—it relocates.

III.A IMMOBILITY THESIS: WHY THE PAPACY INHERITED
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Papacy inherited Roman religious authority not by design but by
structural accident: **it could not relocate**.

Peter's tomb anchored the bishop of Rome to the city. When emperors
fled to Constantinople, when administrators evacuated, when the Senate
dispersed, the Pope remained. The tomb was immovable. Therefore the
office was immovable. Therefore the office inherited.

This is the **immobility thesis**: institutions that cannot defect
inherit by default when mobile institutions flee.

The Constantinople Patriarchate, by contrast, was mobile — the emperor
was present, the court could relocate, the Patriarch served imperial
convenience. Subordination was structural, not theological.

Rome's immobility created liability that became power. The Pope had to
negotiate with Goths, Lombards, Franks — not because he chose to, but
because he could not leave. Each negotiation reinforced his position as
the only stable authority remaining.

> "The popes could not flee. The tomb of Peter held them. And because
> they could not flee, they had to govern. What began as constraint
> became the basis of their authority."
> — Peter Brown, *The Rise of Western Christendom* (2003)

Immobility as inheritance.
Constraint as power.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. CANON LAW AS ROMAN SUCCESSOR
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Roman law does not disappear; it is moralized.

Mommsen emphasizes Rome’s legal instinct surviving through the Church:

> “The Church adopted the Roman conception of law as a universal and
> binding order, and in canon law preserved the juristic habits of the
> ancient world long after the political structure had fallen away.”  
> — Mommsen, *History of Rome*

Judgment replaces conquest.
Procedure replaces command.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. MODERN SCHOLARSHIP — INTERPRETIVE FRAMING
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Modern historians frame the Papacy as Roman continuity by other means.

Anthony Kaldellis notes:

> “What the papacy preserved was not empire, but the Roman claim to
> universality—the belief that a single institution could speak with
> authority to all peoples under heaven.”  
> — Kaldellis, *The New Roman Empire*

Peter Heather similarly observes:

> “The Christian Church did not end Roman civilization; it provided the
> vehicle through which many of its assumptions about authority, law,
> and universality survived the Empire’s political collapse.”  
> — Heather, *The Fall of the Roman Empire*

These interpretations frame, but do not override, ancient testimony.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. SACRAL SOVEREIGNTY & TEMPORAL AMBITION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Papacy oscillates between restraint and domination.

At peaks (e.g., Gregorian Reform):
The Pope acts as emperor without crown.

At failures:
The Papacy reveals Rome’s recurring tension between moral authority and
political temptation.

The form changes.
The dilemma persists.

VI.A FRAGMENT INHERITANCE (RLL–ROME–0006 APPLICATION)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Papacy claims universal authority but holds a **fragment** of Roman
inheritance. This is not failure — it is structural necessity.

Per RLL–ROME–0006 (Fragment Inheritance Law):
> Universal civilizational authority cannot be wholly inherited after
> collapse. Multiple claimants will each hold fragments and claim the
> rest, producing permanent rivalry rather than succession.

The Papacy's fragment: **religious authority in the Western tradition**.

What the Papacy does NOT hold:
• Political sovereignty (claimed by Constantinople, then HRE, then states)
• Eastern religious authority (claimed by Constantinople Patriarchate)
• Territorial enforcement capacity (lost progressively 476–1870)
• Eastern Orthodox communion (lost 1054)

The very persistence of Papal claims to universality proves incompleteness.
Actual universal authority does not require doctrinal assertion.
The claim compensates for what structure cannot provide.

VI.B BIFURCATION THESIS: POLITICAL/RELIGIOUS SPLIT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Roman legitimacy **bifurcated** by 600 AD into two streams:

• **Political stream** → Constantinople (emperor, administration, military)
• **Religious stream** → Rome (Papacy, canon law, Western church)

The bifurcation was crystallized, not created, by the 1054 Schism.
The structural split preceded theological formalization by centuries.

Gregory the Great (590–604) marks the turning point: the Pope governed
Rome directly because no emperor could. By necessity, the Papacy became
both spiritual and temporal — but only in the West. Constantinople
retained political-religious unity under imperial control.

This bifurcation explains why:
• The Papacy developed independence (no emperor present)
• The Patriarchate remained subordinate (emperor present)
• Western Christianity became institutionally distinct from Eastern
• Reunion attempts failed (structures had diverged too far)

The 800 AD coronation of Charlemagne formalized Western political
fragmentation — the Pope created a rival emperor, acknowledging that
Constantinople's political claim no longer extended westward.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. MODERN CONTRACTION & SYMBOLIC POWER
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Territorial power collapses.
Symbolic authority intensifies.

The Papacy ends where Rome began:
claiming authority over meaning, judgment, and legitimacy rather than
land.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VIII. LIMITS & DISCLOSURES
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Spiritual authority ≠ political unity  
• Moral universality ≠ coercive capacity  
• Continuity ≠ restoration  

No doctrine asserted.
No predictive claims made.
Contradictions preserved for SCHOLAR handling.

X. SCHOLAR CONSTRAINTS (RLLs)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This MEM is constrained by bound RLLs from CIV–SCHOLAR–ROME v2.1:

• RLL–ROME–0006 (Fragment Inheritance): Papacy holds religious fragment;
  universal claims prove incompleteness, not authority.

Pending RLLs (not yet bound) that may apply:
• RLL–ROME–0003 (Immobility Inheritance): Papacy inherited because it
  could not relocate (Peter's tomb). Awaiting reformulation.
