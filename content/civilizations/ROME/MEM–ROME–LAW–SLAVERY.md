CREATION NOTE (v2.0) — PHASE II COMPLIANT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This MEM is created under CIV–SCHOLAR–ROME v2.3 (Phase II).

Analytical frame:
• Slavery as Rome's primary labor extraction mechanism
• Manumission as the structural bridge between slavery and citizenship
• The slave-freedman-citizen pathway as absorption mechanism

This MEM is a companion to MEM–ROME–LAW–CITIZENSHIP, showing the
lower boundary of the Roman legal order and its permeability.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves Roman slavery as **Rome's primary mechanism of
labor extraction**: the legal institution that converted conquered
peoples and their descendants into property, while simultaneously
providing a pathway back to personhood through manumission.

For Rome, slavery is not merely exploitation — it is the **floor of
the legal order**, distinguished from other ancient systems by its
institutionalized permeability.

Roman slavery was brutal. It was also unique in scale, legal
sophistication, and the possibility of exit.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. THE STRUCTURE OF ROMAN SLAVERY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Roman law defined slaves (*servi*) as property (*res*), not persons.

Key legal attributes:
• **Dominium**: The master held absolute ownership, including power
  of life and death (limited under later emperors)
• **No legal personality**: Slaves could not own property, marry
  legally, or appear in court in their own name
• **Peculium**: Masters could grant slaves a fund (*peculium*) to
  manage, creating de facto economic agency
• **Vicarius**: Slaves could own other slaves (sub-slaves)

Sources of enslavement:
• War captives (largest source during expansion)
• Birth to slave mothers (*partus sequitur ventrem*)
• Sale of children (permitted under extreme poverty)
• Condemnation for crimes
• Debt bondage (abolished for citizens but persisted for non-citizens)

> "The slave was a thing, not a person. Yet Roman law acknowledged
> that this thing could think, manage property, and become a citizen.
> The contradiction was structural, not accidental."
> — Keith Bradley, *Slavery and Society at Rome* (1994)

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. THE SCALE OF ROMAN SLAVERY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Roman slavery operated at unprecedented scale.

Estimated slave populations:
• Late Republic (1st century BC): 1–2 million slaves in Italy alone
  (20–30% of Italian population)
• Early Empire: Perhaps 5–8 million across the empire
• Peak periods: Major wars could produce hundreds of thousands of
  captives (Caesar's Gallic campaigns, Trajan's Dacian wars)

Economic functions:
• **Agricultural**: Latifundia (large estates) worked by slave gangs
• **Mining**: Brutal conditions in Spanish and Dacian mines
• **Domestic**: Urban households employed slaves for all functions
• **Skilled labor**: Scribes, accountants, teachers, doctors — often
  Greek-speaking slaves with higher education than their masters
• **Public works**: State-owned slaves (*servi publici*) for
  infrastructure

> "Rome was a slave society, not merely a society with slaves. The
> economy, the household, the state itself depended on unfree labor
> at every level."
> — Moses Finley, *Ancient Slavery and Modern Ideology* (1980)

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. MANUMISSION: THE EXIT PATHWAY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Roman slavery was distinguished by **institutionalized manumission** —
the legal process by which slaves became free, and freedmen could
become citizens.

Forms of manumission:
• **Vindicta**: Formal ceremony before a magistrate
• **Census**: Enrollment on the citizen rolls (during Republic)
• **Testamento**: Freedom granted in master's will
• **Inter amicos**: Informal declaration before witnesses (later
  formalized under Augustus)

The freedman (*libertus*) status:
• Gained citizenship (with some limitations under Augustus)
• Remained bound to former master by *obsequium* (deference obligations)
• Children of freedmen were full citizens without restrictions
• Freedmen could become wealthy, powerful, even imperial administrators

> "The peculiarity of Roman slavery was not its cruelty — all ancient
> slavery was cruel — but its permeability. A slave could become a
> citizen. A freedman's grandson could become a senator."
> — Henrik Mouritsen, *The Freedman in the Roman World* (2011)

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. MEARSHEIMER SHARPENING: SLAVERY AS STRUCTURAL EXTRACTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Mercouris reading frames manumission as Rome's unique humanism —
a recognition that slaves were persons despite their legal status.

The realist sharpening asks: **What structural function did slavery serve?**

Structural analysis:
• **Labor extraction**: Slavery converted conquered populations into
  productive assets without ongoing military occupation
• **Elite wealth accumulation**: Latifundia and slave-worked mines
  concentrated wealth in senatorial and equestrian hands
• **Incentive structure**: Manumission created incentives for slave
  compliance — the possibility of freedom encouraged productivity
• **Absorption mechanism**: Freedmen became citizens, their children
  full citizens — slavery was a brutal pathway into Roman society

> "Manumission was not charity. It was incentive design. A slave who
> might one day be free works harder than a slave who cannot hope.
> Rome extracted more labor by offering exit."
> — Keith Hopkins, *Conquerors and Slaves* (1978)

The polyphonic tension:
• Mercouris: Manumission as recognition of slave humanity
• Mearsheimer: Manumission as incentive structure for extraction

Both are valid. Manumission was BOTH humane AND calculated. Masters
freed slaves for reasons of affection AND profit. The system was
brutal AND permeable.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. SLAVERY AND THE CITIZENSHIP PATHWAY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Roman slavery and citizenship were structurally linked:

**The pathway**:
• Slave (*servus*) — property, no legal personality
• Freedman (*libertus*) — citizen with restrictions, bound to patron
• Freedman's child — full citizen without restrictions
• Senator (in some cases) — freedmen's descendants in Senate by Empire

This pathway made Roman slavery unique:
• Greek slavery rarely led to citizenship
• Near Eastern slavery was often permanent caste
• Roman slavery was, for many, a transitional status

The pathway also served absorption:
• Captured Greeks became Roman citizens within two generations
• Eastern slaves brought skills, languages, religions into Roman culture
• "Roman" culture was partly created by absorbed slave populations

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. LIMITS AND RESISTANCE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Not all slaves experienced the permeable system.

Brutal exceptions:
• **Mining slaves**: Rarely manumitted; worked to death
• **Agricultural gang slaves**: Low manumission rates; harsh conditions
• **Gladiators**: Could gain freedom through combat, but mortality high
• **Ergastulum**: Underground prisons for recalcitrant slaves

Resistance:
• **Spartacus revolt** (73–71 BC): 70,000–120,000 slaves in arms;
  required six legions to suppress
• Flight: Runaway slaves (*fugitivi*) were a constant problem
• Subtle resistance: Theft, sabotage, work slowdowns

> "Spartacus proved that slaves could fight. Rome's response was not
> reform but terror — 6,000 crucifixions along the Appian Way."
> — Barry Strauss, *The Spartacus War* (2009)

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VIII. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Slavery extracted labor from conquest more efficiently than occupation.
• Manumission created incentives that increased extraction.
• The slave-freedman-citizen pathway absorbed conquered populations.
• Permeability distinguished Roman slavery from permanent caste systems.
• The brutality and the pathway coexisted without contradiction.

POLYPHONIC TENSIONS (v2.0):
• Slavery was brutal exploitation AND absorption mechanism.
• Manumission was humanitarian AND incentive structure.
• Slaves were property AND future citizens.
• Rome extracted through coercion AND created pathways to belonging.

Tension preserved without verdict.

X. SCHOLAR CONSTRAINTS (RLLs)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This MEM complements the citizenship thesis by showing the lower
boundary of Roman legal personhood and its permeability.

Key constraint: Roman slavery's exit pathway (manumission) was
structurally linked to Rome's absorption mechanism. Unlike caste
systems, Roman slavery converted conquered peoples into citizens
within two generations — preventing permanent alienated populations.
