I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves Gettysburg as America's legitimacy inflection
point in the Civil War: the three-day battle (July 1-3, 1863) that
halted Lee's invasion of Pennsylvania, exhausted Confederate offensive
capacity, and through Lincoln's Address (November 19, 1863) translated
Union sacrifice into a defence of government of the people, by the
people, for the people, binding procedure to moral claim without
constitutional rupture.

Gettysburg does not end the war. It stabilises Union legitimacy and
marks the high-water mark of Confederate offensive reach.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

II. STRATEGIC CONTEXT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
By mid-1863 the war is one of exhaustion. Lee invades Pennsylvania
to fracture Union will, encourage foreign recognition, or force
negotiated settlement. Gettysburg is not chosen as a battlefield; it
emerges from converging movements. Its northern location makes its
political and symbolic weight exceed its operational design.

John Keegan, in *The American Civil War: A Military History* (2009),
on Lincoln's Gettysburg Address:

SOURCE — Keegan, *The American Civil War* (ARC-T-MODERN):
> "The genius of Lincoln's Gettysburg Address" lies in its refusal
> "to differentiate between the sacrifice of the North and the South."
> — John Keegan, *The American Civil War: A Military History* (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 2009) (ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-SECONDARY]. Quote as cited in Gallagher, *Washington Post*, 10 Jan 2010.

Lincoln reframes sacrifice
as defence of legitimacy itself; procedure augmented by universalist
language, not replaced by it.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. OPERATIONAL CHARACTER AND ADDRESS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The battle: three days of escalating violence; confusion and
improvisation; frontal assaults against prepared positions; Pickett's
Charge (July 3) as Confederate offensive exhaustion. Union holds
interior lines and defensive terrain. Gettysburg demonstrates
endurance under institutional command, not operational brilliance.

Lincoln's Gettysburg Address (November 19, 1863) anchors memory: that
government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not
perish from the earth. Sacrifice is dedicated to unfinished work:
union preservation and procedural continuity, elevated to moral claim
without abandoning constitutional form.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Gettysburg encodes moralised procedure under duress: sacrifice
converted into legitimising narrative; endurance as civilizational
resource; universalist language entering American grammar without
rupture.

Lessons: Confederate offensive capacity peaks and is exhausted at
Gettysburg; thereafter defensive and attrition. Legitimacy can be
stabilised by translating loss into meaning; Lincoln's Address as
template. Same week as Vicksburg: symbolic (Gettysburg) and material
(Vicksburg) turning together.

V. MEM CONNECTIONS (MANDATORY)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
AMERICA:
• MEM–AMERICA–WAR–AMERICAN–CIVIL — Parent war; union preservation;
  scale and attrition; Gettysburg as legitimacy inflection.
• MEM–AMERICA–LINCOLN — Gettysburg Address; legitimacy reframing;
  procedure and moral claim; crisis presidency.
• MEM–AMERICA–WAR–AMERICAN–CIVIL–LEE — Confederate commander;
  invasion of Pennsylvania; Keegan on failure to control
  subordinates; high-water mark.
• MEM–AMERICA–WAR–AMERICAN–CIVIL–STONEWALL–JACKSON — Jackson dead
  May 1863; Gettysburg fought without Lee's principal strike
  commander.
• MEM–AMERICA–WAR–AMERICAN–CIVIL–VICKSBURG — Same week July 1863;
  Vicksburg material severance; Gettysburg symbolic stabilisation;
  dual turning point.
• MEM–AMERICA–WAR–AMERICAN–CIVIL–APPOMATTOX — Gettysburg halts
  Confederate offensive; Appomattox executes procedural termination.

Cross-Civilizational:
• MEM–ANGLIA–WAR–AMERICAN–CIVIL–GETTYSBURG — Anglian encoding;
  legitimacy translation; same battle, different frame.

Cross-references denote lineage, not equivalence.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Gettysburg: Lee's invasion halted; Confederate offensive exhausted;
Lincoln's Address binds sacrifice to government of the people. Moral
framing stabilises endurance; procedure carries universalist language
temporarily. Paired with Vicksburg (same week): symbolic and material
turning.

Tension preserved without verdict.
