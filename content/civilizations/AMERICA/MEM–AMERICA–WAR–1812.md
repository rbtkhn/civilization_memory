I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves the War of 1812 as **America's second contest
with Britain**: a conflict fought over maritime sovereignty
(impressment, neutral rights, blockade), territorial ambition
(Canada), and the consolidation of independence—ending in status
quo (Treaty of Ghent, 1814) but encoding resilience, symbolic
victories (New Orleans, post-treaty), and the failure of conquest
northward.

For America, the war is **assertion and stalemate**—no gain, no
loss; independence reaffirmed; Canada retained by Britain.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. TRIGGER: IMPRESSMENT, NEUTRAL RIGHTS, EXPANSION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The war is declared over sovereignty and opportunity.

Context:
• British impressment of American sailors; neutral trade restrictions
  tied to Napoleonic blockade; American framing as sovereignty
  violation
• Western expansion pressure; border friction; desire to remove
  British presence from Canada and secure northern frontier
• Madison and War Hawks; Congress declares war (June 1812);
  procedural initiation—civilian authority, not executive fiat

Legitimacy is **procedural and grievance-based**: redress of
maritime rights and security of the republic. Britain treats
the theatre as secondary to Napoleon; America treats it as
existential to sovereignty.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. INVASION OF CANADA & OPERATIONAL REALITY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
American offensives northward fail.

Elements:
• Multiple invasions of Upper and Lower Canada; British and
  Canadian resistance; logistical and tactical reverses
• No lasting territorial gain; Canada remains British
• War on land becomes **defensive** after initial failures—
  repelling British raids, protecting coastline and capital

Conquest of Canada is **denied**; the republic learns the limits
of expansion against a power that prioritises the theatre below
existential level but can still defend.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. NAVAL DUELS, COASTAL RAIDS, WASHINGTON BURNED
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
British naval superiority and raid logic define the coastal war.

Elements:
• Single-ship duels (Constitution, etc.)—symbolic American
  victories; disproportionate memory weight; strategic impact
  limited
• British blockade; coastal raids; Chesapeake campaign
• Burning of Washington (August 1814)—Capitol and White House;
  humiliation and resilience; government flees, returns; procedure
  (government, continuity) survives

The capital is **burned but not captured**; the republic absorbs
the blow and continues. Symbolic events (Star-Spangled Banner,
Fort McHenry) encode resistance; Treaty of Ghent is negotiated
while war continues.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. NEW ORLEANS & TREATY OF GHENT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Settlement and post-settlement battle.

Sequence:
• Treaty of Ghent (December 1814)—status quo ante bellum; no
  territorial change; no formal resolution of impressment;
  implicit acceptance of separation
• Battle of New Orleans (January 1815)—fought after peace signed;
  Jackson's victory; British assault repelled; encodes **American
  defensive victory** and martial legitimacy in popular memory
• War ends without transformation; both sides exit; Canada
  British; America sovereign; maritime grievances deferred

John Keegan, on institutional restraint and the use of force in
*A History of Warfare* (1993), frames how states confine violence:

SOURCE — Keegan, *A History of Warfare* (ARC-T-MODERN):
> "Our institutions and our laws, we tell ourselves, have set the human
> potentiality for violence about with such restraints that violence in
> everyday life will be punished as criminal by our laws, while its use
> by our institutions of state will take the particular form of
> 'civilised warfare.'"
> — John Keegan, *A History of Warfare* (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1993) (ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-SECONDARY].

The War of 1812 is **constrained** by choice on both sides—status quo
at Ghent, no revolutionary escalation; procedure (treaty, continuity)
holds.

New Orleans becomes **symbolic closure**—victory in American
memory despite strategic draw. Procedure (treaty) and battle
(timing) diverge; memory compresses toward resilience.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The War of 1812 encodes **sovereignty assertion, stalemate, and
resilience without victory**.

Lessons:
• War can be declared procedurally (Congress) over grievance
  (impressment, neutral rights); Britain's priority elsewhere
  constrains escalation.
• Conquest of Canada fails; northern expansion has a ceiling
  when the defender can hold and the attacker cannot mass
  decisive force.
• Capital can be burned and government can flee—procedure
  (continuity, return) survives; resilience as legitimacy.
• Status quo peace (Ghent) encodes no defeat, no victory;
  independence reaffirmed; symbolic victory (New Orleans)
  outweighs strategic outcome in memory.
• Second war with Britain confirms separation without resolving
  all grievances; America and Britain learn to manage rivalry.

The war is America's **second independence test**: assertion,
stalemate, and symbolic resilience.

VII. MEM CONNECTIONS (MANDATORY)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
AMERICA:
• MEM–AMERICA–WAR–AMERICAN–INDEPENDENCE — First war with Britain;
  independence won; 1812 as second contest; no territorial change
  either way at Ghent.
• MEM–AMERICA–MADISON — War president; declaration of war;
  procedural initiation; capital burned on his watch.
• MEM–AMERICA–JACKSON — New Orleans (1815); defensive victory;
  martial legitimacy; later president.
• MEM–AMERICA–WASHINGTON — Founding restraint; 1812 as post-founding
  assertion; contrast: no conquest of Canada.
• MEM–AMERICA–MONROE — Post-war consolidation; era of good feelings;
  border and navy policy after 1815.

Cross-Civilizational:
• MEM–ANGLIA–WAR–1812 — British perspective; peripheral theatre;
  priority discipline; naval resilience; status quo exit.
• MEM–ANGLIA–CANADA — Defence of Canada; no loss; northern
  boundary stabilised.

Cross-references denote lineage, not equivalence.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VIII. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Sovereignty and neutral rights can trigger war; Britain's
  focus elsewhere limits scope.
• Conquest of Canada fails; northern expansion ceiling.
• Washington burned; procedure survives; resilience.
• Ghent: status quo; no victory, no defeat; independence
  reaffirmed.
• New Orleans: symbolic victory after peace; memory overrides
  chronology.

Tension preserved without verdict.
