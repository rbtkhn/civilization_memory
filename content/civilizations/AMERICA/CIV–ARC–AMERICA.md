**DERIVATION CLAUSE (BINDING):**
This ARC is **derived from CIV–ARC–ANGLIA**. America inherits Anglian
author admissibility and temporal categories for constitutive (pre-America
and colonial North American) content. ARC–AMERICA carries forward the
applicable ARC–ANGLIA author list and adds America-specific institutional
sources (ARC-T-INSTITUTIONAL) for STATE mode analysis of the U.S. and
Western Hemisphere. MEM–AMERICA files and MEM–ANGLIA content ingested
as constitutive by CIV–SCHOLAR–AMERICA may cite ARC–ANGLIA–listed
authors for such content without cross-ARC declaration.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
I. PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
ARC–AMERICA governs author admissibility and temporal precedence for
MEM–AMERICA files and for any MEM content that is America-specific.
Quotation quantity and quality are governed by CIV–MEM–TEMPLATE.

**DERIVATION FROM ARC–ANGLIA (BINDING):**

America is derived from England (CIV–SCHOLAR–AMERICA, CIV–STATE–AMERICA).
Pre-America Anglian culture and history are core to U.S. history and
present. ARC–AMERICA is therefore **derived from ARC–ANGLIA**. Authors
and temporal categories from ARC–ANGLIA that cover Anglian, colonial
North American, and founding-era material are **constitutive** for
ARC–AMERICA. MEM–AMERICA files (when created) and MEM–ANGLIA files
ingested as constitutive by CIV–SCHOLAR–AMERICA may cite ARC–ANGLIA–
listed authors for such content without cross-ARC declaration. ARC–
AMERICA carries forward the applicable ARC–ANGLIA author list below
and adds America-specific institutional sources (ARC-T-INSTITUTIONAL)
for STATE mode analysis of the U.S. and Western Hemisphere.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. ARC-TEMPORAL CATEGORIES (ARC-T)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Same structure as ARC–ANGLIA. Precedence: ANCIENT > MEDIEVAL >
EARLY-MOD > MODERN. Later periods may clarify; they may not override
earlier testimony.

ARC-T-ANCIENT — Foundational period; direct witnesses.
ARC-T-MEDIEVAL — Medieval transmission.
ARC-T-EARLY-MOD — c. 1500–1900; typically out of copyright.
ARC-T-MODERN — c. 1900–present; current scholarship.
ARC-T-INSTITUTIONAL — Institutional sources for STATE mode (see § IX-B).

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Only listed authors may be quoted without ARC–DISCOVERY flag. For
sources not listed here but listed in ARC–ANGLIA and used for
constitutive Anglian-derived content, cite as (ARC–ANGLIA–T-MODERN)
or appropriate temporal category.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. DISCOVERY FRAMEWORK
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
When a MEM or STATE citation requires sources beyond the list above:

DISCOVERY FLAG (REQUIRED):
"ARC–DISCOVERY: EXPANDED SEARCH
Source: [Author/Work or Institutional source]
Justification: [Why this source is necessary]"

Expanded discovery does not add authors to this canon without an
ARC version upgrade.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. CROSS-ARC CITATION (DERIVATION RULE)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
For MEM–AMERICA files and for constitutive Anglian-derived content:
• ARC–ANGLIA is the source ARC for pre-America Anglian and colonial
  North American material. Citations from ARC–ANGLIA–listed authors
  for such content do not require cross-ARC declaration (they are
  constitutive).
• When citing an ARC–ANGLIA author for content that is purely
  Anglian (e.g. UK-only) in an America-specific MEM, declare:
  [Author], [Work] (ARC–ANGLIA–T-[PERIOD]) [ERC-ROLE].
• TSP MEMs (Trans-Sovereign Pattern) may require sources from
  multiple ARCs per CIV–MEM–CORE § XXIX; cross-ARC citations MUST
  declare ARC–[CIV]-T-[PERIOD].

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V-A. CROSS-ARC CITATION FOR TSP MEMs (derived from ARC–ANGLIA § V-A)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Trans-Sovereign Pattern (TSP) MEMs may require sources from multiple
civilizations' ARCs. Per CIV–MEM–CORE § XXIX.

TSP PATTERN TYPES: TRANSMISSION, NETWORK, RECONSTITUTION

CROSS-ARC CITATION RULES:
1. Primary ARC for MEMs filed under AMERICA is ARC–AMERICA.
2. For constitutive pre-America content, ARC–ANGLIA is constitutive
   (no cross-ARC declaration required when content is colonial/founding).
3. TSP MEMs MAY cite sources from connected civilizations' ARCs.
4. Cross-ARC citations MUST declare: [Author], [Work] (ARC–[CIV]-T-[PERIOD]) [ERC-ROLE]
5. Temporal precedence applies within each ARC independently.
6. Unlisted sources require standard discovery flag.

TSP EXAMPLES (AMERICA): MEM–AMERICA–* that span hemisphere or
Anglosphere (e.g. NETWORK, RECONSTITUTION) may cite ARC–ANGLIA,
ARC–[LATAM], or other ARCs with declaration.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. ORTHOGONALITY WITH ERC
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
ARC-T (temporal) and ERC (evidence role) are ORTHOGONAL. A quotation
has BOTH. See NAMESPACE–CLARIFICATION v1.0.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. WHAT ARC DOES NOT GOVERN
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Governed by CIV–MEM–TEMPLATE v3.0, NOT by ARC:
• 20% verbatim quote minimum • EQS • Analytical content floor
• Quote word counting • ERC evidence-role classification

ARC determines WHO may be quoted. MEM–TEMPLATE determines HOW MUCH
and HOW WELL.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VIII. MIRRORING / REFERENCE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file is referenced by version pointer in:
• CIV–STATE–AMERICA (Source Versions; STATE mode evidence; Layer 3 sources)
