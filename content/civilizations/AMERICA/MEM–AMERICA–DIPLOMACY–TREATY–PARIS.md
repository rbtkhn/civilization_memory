I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves the **Treaty of Paris (1783)** as America's
founding diplomatic closure: the instrument by which Great Britain
recognised the independence of the United States and fixed boundaries,
thereby converting military outcome (Yorktown 1781, Franco-American
alliance) into **institutional recognition** under the law of nations.

It seems to me that the crucial point is legitimacy. The colonies had
fought as procedural claimants; the Treaty does not grant them something
they lacked so much as **record** what the war had already produced—
sovereign statehood acknowledged by the former sovereign. The question,
really, is how recognition was secured: through French alliance altering
the balance, British exhaustion, and negotiators (Adams, Franklin, Jay)
who treated with London while preserving the Franco-American tie. One
has to understand that the Treaty is both **termination** (end of
hostilities) and **origin** (the moment the United States enters the
European state system as a recognised actor).

Structural constraint operated throughout: Britain, having lost the
thirteen colonies and facing French and Spanish pressure elsewhere,
had a structural incentive to settle; the United States had a structural
incentive to secure the Mississippi as western boundary and fishing
rights without conceding loyalist or debt enforcement that would
undermine domestic legitimacy. The fact is that the outcome reflected
the post-Yorktown force picture—Britain could not reconquer; the U.S.
could not expand the war. Closure capacity was high: one treaty ended
the war and fixed the territorial and legal frame for the new state.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

III. NEGOTIATION & LEGITIMACY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The American commission—John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, John Jay—negotiated
in Paris from 1782. Adams, the legal-diplomatic continuity figure
(MEM–AMERICA–PRESIDENT–ADAMS), had long experience in Congress and
European courts; Franklin supplied prestige and French rapport; Jay
insisted on direct British negotiation rather than through Versailles,
preserving the option to settle without French approval if British
terms were acceptable. The British negotiator David Hartley treated
with the Americans as plenipotentiaries of a sovereign entity.

Key provisions: British recognition of the United States as "free,
sovereign and independent"; boundaries along the Great Lakes, the
Mississippi (western limit), and the 31st parallel (southern, with
Spain); fishing rights off Newfoundland and the Gulf of Saint Lawrence;
creditors on both sides to meet lawful debts; Congress to recommend
that states restore loyalist property (a soft obligation that many
states ignored—so legitimacy of the new order trumped strict compliance).
The Treaty thus encoded **sovereign equality** and **territorial
closure** while leaving implementation of loyalist and debt clauses
to domestic politics.
