I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves the **Monroe Doctrine** as America's **declarative
perimeter**: the 1823 statement that no new European colonization in
the Americas would be tolerated and that the U.S. would abstain from
European power struggles—a **strategic signal** issued before the United
States possessed the force to enforce it alone.

The fact is that the Doctrine is a **structural claim**. It allocates
a sphere of permissible action (hemisphere) and declares European
interference off limits. What the balance of power told the U.S. to
do was to **draw the line**—to signal where the American interest
lay so that other states could factor it in. The name of the game was
to establish the rule-set before capability fully matched it; form
precedes force. From a structural point of view, the Doctrine encodes
**incentive structure**: we have a vested interest in keeping European
powers out of the hemisphere and in avoiding entanglement in European
wars. That's our incentive structure; it is not Europe's.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

II. BALANCE OF POWER & STRUCTURAL CONTEXT (1823)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The structural picture in 1823 is clear.

Context:
• Napoleonic Wars ended (1815); Holy Alliance (Russia, Prussia, Austria)
  contemplates intervention to restore Spanish control in Latin America
• Britain has broken with the Alliance on this question—London opposes
  re-colonization; Royal Navy dominates the Atlantic
• U.S. has no fleet capable of excluding European powers; U.S. has
  every incentive to keep European armies and navies out of the Americas

So when Monroe and his cabinet (Adams, in particular) draft the
message, they are not declaring what they can enforce by themselves.
They are declaring what they **want** the system to produce—and they
are doing so in the knowledge that British naval power will do most of
the enforcing. The question is whether the U.S. should make the
declaration at all. The realist observation here would be direct:
the U.S. has a powerful structural incentive to make the declaration
because it stakes a claim at low cost (Britain bears the enforcement
burden) and reserves the right to act later when capability grows.

James Monroe, Annual Message to Congress (2 December 1823), the
passages that later crystallize as the "Monroe Doctrine":

SOURCE — Monroe, Annual Message to Congress (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD):
> "The American continents, by the free and independent condition which they have assumed and maintain, are henceforth not to be considered as subjects for future colonization by any European powers. … We owe it, therefore, to candor and to the amicable relations existing between the United States and those powers to declare that we should consider any attempt on their part to extend their system to any portion of this hemisphere as dangerous to our peace and safety."
> — James Monroe, Seventh Annual Message to Congress, 2 Dec. 1823, in *A Compilation of the Messages and Papers of the Presidents*, ed. James D. Richardson, Vol. 2 (Washington: Bureau of National Literature, 1897), 776–789 (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD) [ERC-PRIMARY].

On abstention from European wars:

SOURCE — Monroe, Annual Message (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD):
> "In the wars of the European powers in matters relating to themselves we have never taken any part, nor does it comport with our policy to do so. It is only when our rights are invaded or seriously menaced that we resent injuries or make preparation for our defense."
> — James Monroe, Seventh Annual Message to Congress, 2 Dec. 1823, ibid. (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD) [ERC-PRIMARY].

The Doctrine is **declarative**. It does not create capability; it
**signals** intent and invites the listener (Europe, Britain) to
update their expectations. Power is signaled before it is possessed.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. INCENTIVE STRUCTURE — WHY DECLARE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
From an American point of view, it makes eminently good sense to
declare a hemispheric perimeter.

**Our incentive structure:**
• Keep European military presence out of the Americas—no new
  colonization, no extension of European "system" (monarchy,
  intervention) into the hemisphere
• Avoid being drawn into European balance-of-power wars—abstention
  as a way to preserve freedom of action and avoid costly entanglements
• Reserve the right to expand and consolidate within the hemisphere
  without European interference

**Their incentive structure (European powers):**
• Restore or extend influence in the New World where possible
• Use Latin American instability or debt as leverage
• Balance against each other in Europe; Americas as secondary theater

So when you contrast the two sides, you see the incentive structures
are **light years apart**. The U.S. wants the Americas closed to
European colonization and the U.S. wants to stay out of European
wars. European powers want flexibility to intervene where they can.
The Doctrine is the American statement of **what we will treat as
dangerous**—and thus what we are asking the system to respect.

The structural logic is: declare the rule so that the rule becomes
the baseline. Enforcement can follow; declaration comes first.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. DEPENDENCE ON BRITISH SEA POWER
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The fact is that the Doctrine was not enforceable by the United States
alone in 1823.

Reality:
• Royal Navy enforced the Atlantic order; British policy opposed
  re-colonization of Latin America
• U.S. capacity was embryonic—no fleet capable of excluding European
  squadrons from the hemisphere
• The Declaration substituted for immediate force; Britain's navy did
  the work the Doctrine claimed as American interest

So the Doctrine is a **free ride** on British naval primacy—or, more
precisely, a **alignment of interests**: Britain did not want Spain
or the Holy Alliance to re-establish colonies in the Americas; the
U.S. did not want it either. The U.S. put the claim in writing;
Britain had the guns. Form precedes force; the form was American,
the force was British. Anglia underwrites the rule it publicly
disclaims.

This is not a criticism—it is the structural observation. When
capability is limited, you signal and you rely on others whose
incentives align. The Doctrine encodes that logic.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. LATER INVOCATIONS — STRENGTHENING AND PRESERVATION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Doctrine was not frozen in 1823. Later presidents **strengthened**
or **preserved** it; none formally abandoned it.

**Roosevelt Corollary (1904):** Theodore Roosevelt added that the
U.S. would exercise "international police power" in the hemisphere
when disorder or default threatened—preventive intervention. The
perimeter was **strengthened**, not relaxed. Monroe's "no European
colonization" became "we will police the hemisphere so that Europe
has no excuse to intervene." Same structural logic: keep Europe out;
add American enforcement when capability and will align. MEM–AMERICA–
ROOSEVELT–THEODORE.

**Nixon/Kissinger (1969–1974):** Hemisphere perimeter (Monroe) was
**preserved**, not abandoned. Opening to China and détente with the
Soviet Union extended U.S. policy beyond the hemisphere, but Monroe
was not relaxed—it was **supplemented** by great-power management.
ENTRY 0012 (CIV–SCHOLAR–AMERICA) treats this preservation as the
contrast to perimeter reversal (e.g. Suez: forced loss encoded as
survivable). MEM–AMERICA–NIXON, MEM–AMERICA–KISSINGER.

So the structural picture across time: the Doctrine is **declarative
perimeter**; the option set for "relax enforcement" or "negotiate
exit" is not modeled in the MEM's frame—the Doctrine encodes
commitment. When the U.S. later steps back (if it does), that would
require a separate encoding (choice vs forced loss). The Doctrine
itself does not contain the reversal option.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Monroe Doctrine encodes **perimeter-first legitimacy** and
**strategic signal before capability**.

Lessons:
• Declarations can shape space before power fills it—form precedes
  force
• The incentive structure of the declarant (keep Europe out, stay out
  of Europe) is not the incentive structure of others; the Declaration
  states our position
• Boundaries stabilize young systems; the hemisphere becomes the
  American sphere by declaration and, over time, by capability
• Dependence on a patron (Britain) does not invalidate the declaration—it
  describes the structural condition under which the declaration was
  made

Monroe draws the map. Capability and later presidents fill it in.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Strategic rules can precede enforcement; the Doctrine is the rule.
• The balance of power told the U.S. to declare; Britain's navy made
  the declaration credible.
• Our incentive structure (hemisphere closed to Europe, U.S. out of
  European wars) is not their incentive structure; the Doctrine is
  our statement.
• Declarative perimeter encodes commitment; the option set that would
  include "relax" or "exit" is not in the Doctrine's frame (ENTRY 0012).
• Roosevelt Corollary strengthens; Nixon/Kissinger preserve; the
  Doctrine is the enduring structural claim.

Tension preserved without verdict.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VIII. MEM CONNECTIONS (MANDATORY)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
DEPENDS_ON:
• MEM–AMERICA–MONROE — Figure who delivered the Doctrine; Monroe as
  strategic boundary declarer; doctrine and figure are distinct (this
  file = doctrine as structural artifact).
• MEM–AMERICA–LAW–CONSTITUTION — No explicit constitutional basis for
  the Doctrine; it is executive/congressional message and custom, not
  treaty or statute.

ENABLES / TEMPORAL_AFTER:
• MEM–AMERICA–ROOSEVELT–THEODORE — Roosevelt Corollary (1904);
  Doctrine strengthened by "hemispheric police" framing.
• MEM–AMERICA–NIXON, MEM–AMERICA–KISSINGER — Monroe preserved while
  policy extended beyond hemisphere; no perimeter reversal.

PARALLELS:
• MEM–AMERICA–GEO–SUEZ–CANAL — Anglia's declarative control (Suez
  will not be closed); control without sovereignty; perimeter reversal
  (1956) encoded as loss without collapse; contrast to Monroe preserved.
• MEM–ANGLIA–GEO–ATLANTIC — British naval dominance underwrote Monroe;
  Atlantic as enforcement space.

Cross-references denote lineage and contrast, not equivalence.
