I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves Bull Run as **America's encoding of the war's
opening reality check and of Confederate tactical success on the
same ground**: First Bull Run (July 21, 1861)—the first major
battle, Union defeat, and the birth of "Stonewall" Jackson—and
Second Bull Run (August 28–30, 1862)—Lee and Jackson's defeat of
Pope, confirming Confederate capacity for offensive maneuver in
Virginia.

Bull Run does not decide the war.
It **fixes the scale of the war and the cost of underestimation**.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

II. FIRST BULL RUN (JULY 21, 1861)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Months after Fort Sumter, both sides expect a short war. Union
forces under McDowell advance toward Manassas; Confederate forces
under Beauregard (and Johnston, arriving by rail) defend. Battle
along Bull Run stream; Union initial gains; Confederate stand at
Henry House Hill—Brigadier Bee's sobriquet "Stonewall" for Jackson's
brigade ("There stands Jackson like a stone wall"). Confederate
counterattack; Union retreat becomes rout; civilians and soldiers
flee toward Washington. Union defeat; Confederate victory.

Meaning: **short-war illusion shattered**. Both sides recognise
the conflict will be long and costly. "Stonewall" enters
civilizational memory as symbol of immovable defence and later
offensive shock. No decisive pursuit; Confederate capacity to
exploit victory is limited.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. SECOND BULL RUN (AUGUST 28–30, 1862)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
One year later, same general theatre. Lee's Army of Northern
Virginia faces Pope's Union Army of Virginia. Jackson marches
around Pope's flank; captures Union supply depot at Manassas
Junction; takes defensive position. Lee and Longstreet converge.
Battle of Second Bull Run (Second Manassas): Confederate attack
drives Pope from the field; Union retreat. Confederate tactical
victory; Lee's offensive template—movement, concentration, shock—
confirmed. Prelude to Maryland campaign (Antietam).

Meaning: **Confederate capacity for operational maneuver** on
Northern Virginia ground; Jackson and Lee together; same geography
as First Bull Run, different scale and command structure. Union
again learns that eastern theatre will not yield quick resolution.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Bull Run (First and Second) encodes **reality check and Confederate
tactical proof**—the same ground witnesses Union defeat twice; the
first battle destroys short-war illusion; the second confirms Lee
and Jackson's eastern-theatre effectiveness.

Lessons:
• First major battle (First Bull Run) fixes war scale; procedure
  (Union preservation) continues but timeline and cost are
  recalibrated.
• "Stonewall" as enduring symbol: born at First Bull Run; Second
  Bull Run shows Jackson in offensive role under Lee.
• Same geography, two Confederate victories; Union must eventually
  win by attrition and depth (Grant, Sherman, Sheridan), not by
  single eastern battle.

V. MEM CONNECTIONS (MANDATORY)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
AMERICA:
• MEM–AMERICA–WAR–AMERICAN–CIVIL — Parent war; eastern theatre;
  Bull Run as first major battle and repeated Confederate victory.
• MEM–AMERICA–WAR–AMERICAN–CIVIL–FORT–SUMTER — War begins at Sumter;
  First Bull Run is first major battle months later; scale revealed.
• MEM–AMERICA–WAR–AMERICAN–CIVIL–STONEWALL–JACKSON — "Stonewall"
  sobriquet at First Bull Run; Second Bull Run as Jackson's march
  and victory under Lee.
• MEM–AMERICA–WAR–AMERICAN–CIVIL–LEE — Second Bull Run: Lee's
  command; offensive template; prelude to Antietam and
  Chancellorsville.
• MEM–AMERICA–PRESIDENT–LINCOLN — President; Union defeat at First Bull Run
  forces recalibration; war of attrition and procedure continues.

Cross-Civilizational:
• MEM–ANGLIA–WAR–AMERICAN–CIVIL — Anglian encoding; same war;
  Bull Run as early eastern theatre engagement.

Cross-references denote lineage, not equivalence.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• First Bull Run: July 1861; first major battle; Union defeat;
  "Stonewall" Jackson; short-war illusion shattered.
• Second Bull Run: Aug 1862; Lee and Jackson defeat Pope; same
  ground; Confederate offensive template confirmed.
• Same geography, two Confederate victories; war scale and cost
  fixed early.

Tension preserved without verdict.
