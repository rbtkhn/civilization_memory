# Schlesinger Verbatim Integration Opportunities — MEM–AMERICA

**Purpose:** Identify additional MEM files where Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. verbatim (≥25 words) would strengthen civilizational memory, with book/section fit and suggested placement. Already integrated: MEM–AMERICA–PRESIDENT–JACKSON (*The Age of Jackson*), MEM–AMERICA–PRESIDENT–ROOSEVELT–FRANKLIN (*The Crisis of the Old Order*).

**ARC scope:** Schlesinger is in CIV–ARC–AMERICA under ARC-T-MODERN with *The Age of Jackson* and *The Age of Roosevelt* (3 vols). To cite *A Thousand Days* or *The Imperial Presidency*, add them to his ARC entry.

---

## 1. MEM–AMERICA–PRESIDENT–KENNEDY

**Book:** *A Thousand Days: John F. Kennedy in the White House* (1965).

**Thematic fit:** Kennedy as Cold War crisis manager; Cuban context (Bay of Pigs, Missile Crisis); hemisphere and legitimacy; “unfinished symbol.” Schlesinger was JFK special assistant and “court historian”; his account is primary-secondary (witness + interpreter).

**Suggested placement:** §II (Origin & Style) or §III (Cuban Missile Crisis & Procedural Enforcement).

**Candidate passage (Cuba / Castro and revolution):**
> "Though Fidel came to boast of his Marxism-Leninism, he himself never joined the Communist Party. As the revolution careened along, the Communists may even at times have served as a restraining force, especially in foreign affairs. Yet, despite the jostling for position between Communists and Fidelistas, the year 1959 saw the clear commitment of Castro's revolution to the establishment of a Marxist dictatorship in Cuba and the service of Soviet foreign policy in the world—a commitment so incompatible with the expressed purposes of the revolution as surely to justify the word betrayal."

**Alternative (paradox of power):**
> "What Mailer left out was the paradox of power—that the exercise of power is necessary to fulfill purpose, yet the world of power dooms many purposes to frustration."

**Citation:** Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., *A Thousand Days: John F. Kennedy in the White House* (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1965) (ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-SECONDARY]. *Add A Thousand Days to Schlesinger’s ARC entry.*

## 2. MEM–AMERICA–GREAT–DEPRESSION

**Book:** *The Crisis of the Old Order* (1957) or *The Coming of the New Deal* (1958).

**Thematic fit:** Collapse of business legitimacy; 1929 crash; Hoover’s inadequacy; “crisis without invasion”; state as guarantor. Schlesinger’s Age of Roosevelt is a standard narrative for the period.

**Suggested placement:** §II (Context & Trigger) or §IV (New Deal as Response).

**Candidate theme:** Search for verbatim in *The Crisis of the Old Order* on (a) “cult of business” and its collapse, or (b) public trust in business leadership shattered by the crash. The existing FDR MEM quote (“Constitution had become a hazy document”) could be echoed or a companion passage on 1920s complacency / post-crash legitimacy could be added.

**Action:** Locate one ≥25-word passage in *Crisis of the Old Order* or *Coming of the New Deal* on business legitimacy, crash, or New Deal as response; insert after “Legitimacy of **laissez-faire**… is challenged” (§II) or in §IV before/after “The state becomes **provider and regulator**.”

---

## 3. MEM–AMERICA–PRESIDENT–TRUMAN

**Book:** *The Imperial Presidency* (1973).

**Thematic fit:** Truman as succession president who inherits wartime and Cold War authority; expansion of executive war-making and foreign-policy power; “containment architect.” Schlesinger argues that WWII and Cold War “nurtured in the sense of omnipresent crisis” displaced power from Congress to an “increasingly imperial Presidency.”

**Suggested placement:** §II (Origin & Style) or §IV (Truman Doctrine…) or §V (MacArthur removal — civilian supremacy).

**Candidate passage (from scholarly summary / Wikipedia; verify in book):**
> "The new American approach to world affairs, nurtured in the sense of omnipresent crisis, set new political objectives, developed new military capabilities, devised new diplomatic techniques, invented new instruments of foreign operations and instituted a new hierarchy of values. Every one of these innovations encouraged the displacement of power, both practical and constitutional, from an increasingly acquiescent Congress into an increasingly imperial Presidency."

**Alternative (Imperial Presidency, Goodreads):**
> "The single-man Presidency, with the right man as President, had its uses; and historically Americans had as often as not chosen the right man."

**Citation:** Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., *The Imperial Presidency* (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1973) (ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-SECONDARY]. *Add The Imperial Presidency to Schlesinger’s ARC entry.*

---

## 4. MEM–AMERICA–MACARTHUR

**Book:** *The Imperial Presidency* (1973).

**Thematic fit:** Civilian control; Truman’s removal of MacArthur; procedure (commander-in-chief, subordination of military to president). Schlesinger’s thesis on the imperial presidency includes the post-WWII expansion of executive war power and the president’s role as decider.

**Suggested placement:** Section on Truman’s removal of MacArthur (civilian supremacy).

**Candidate:** Same “displacement of power… into an increasingly imperial Presidency” passage as Truman, or a passage on presidential vs. military authority. *Imperial Presidency* discusses war powers and the commander-in-chief; locate a sentence on civilian control or the MacArthur episode if present.

**Action:** Verify whether Schlesinger discusses MacArthur/Truman explicitly; if yes, use that. If not, the general “imperial Presidency” passage still supports the MEM’s frame (president as final authority over the military).

---

## 5. MEM–AMERICA–PRESIDENT–JEFFERSON

**Book:** *The Age of Jackson* (1945).

**Thematic fit:** Jeffersonian vs. Jacksonian liberalism; “Jeffersonians had buried: the need for strong government”; liberalism as recurring cycle. Schlesinger links Jefferson to Jackson (and later FDR) in a cycle of liberal reform and conservative recovery.

**Suggested placement:** §V (Tension with Anglian Pragmatism) or §III (Universalization).

**Candidate theme:** From the Goodreads review of *The Age of Jackson* (p. 520): “a century of bitter experience in the democratic fight finally led liberalism to uncover what Jeffersonians had buried: the need for strong government”; “it grew increasingly apparent that workingmen required protection from the mercies of their employers”; “this called for government to take a much more active role in economic life.” A single combined or two-sentence verbatim from that page would tie Jefferson (limited-government rhetoric) to the later Jacksonian/FDR “strong government” correction.

**Action:** Verify exact wording on p. 520 (or nearby) of *The Age of Jackson*; add one SOURCE block to MEM–AMERICA–PRESIDENT–JEFFERSON in §V or at end of §III.

---

## 6. MEM–AMERICA–PRESIDENT–ROOSEVELT–THEODORE

**Book:** *The Age of Jackson* (1945) or *The Age of Roosevelt* (1957).

**Thematic fit:** TR in the liberal tradition (Jackson → TR → FDR); “strong government” and reform; executive energy. Schlesinger’s cycle (Jackson, then TR, then FDR) positions Theodore Roosevelt as part of the same liberal-reform arc.

**Suggested placement:** §VII (Civilizational Memory Function) or §III (Domestic: Square Deal).

**Candidate theme:** A sentence from *The Age of Roosevelt* or *The Age of Jackson* that names TR as heir to the Jacksonian impulse or as precursor to FDR’s New Deal. (May require search in *Crisis of the Old Order* opening chapters on the 1920s and the “old order”—TR often appears as contrast to Harding/Coolidge.)

**Action:** Locate one Schlesinger sentence that explicitly links TR to the liberal/reform cycle or to “strong government”; insert to reinforce MEM’s “executive energizer” and “bully pulpit” encoding.

---

## 7. MEM–AMERICA–MORGAN or MEM–AMERICA–CARNEGIE or MEM–AMERICA–VANDERBILT

**Book:** *The Crisis of the Old Order* (1957) or *The Age of Jackson* (1945).

**Thematic fit:** “Capitalists from destroying it” (Jackson MEM already has this); 1920s “cult of business” and its crash (Crisis of the Old Order); concentration of wealth and liberal response.

**Suggested placement:** In a MEM focused on Gilded Age / industrial concentration, a Schlesinger passage on (a) business legitimacy and its collapse (1929), or (b) the liberal object to “keep capitalists from destroying” capitalism (already in Jackson; could be echoed in one tycoon MEM as civilizational pattern).

**Action:** Lower priority unless a MEM explicitly thematizes “legitimacy of business” or “collapse of confidence in elites”; then *Crisis of the Old Order* on 1920s business cult and 1929 would fit.

---

## 8. MEM–AMERICA–PRESIDENT–ADAMS–JQ or MEM–AMERICA–PRESIDENT–LINCOLN

**Book:** *The Age of Jackson* (Adams as foil); *The Disuniting of America* or other (Lincoln on Know-Nothings, already in Goodreads as Schlesinger-cited Lincoln quote).

**Thematic fit:** Adams–Jackson contest; Lincoln’s warning about nativism (Know-Nothings). Schlesinger in *Disuniting* quotes Lincoln on “all men are created equal, except Negroes, and foreigners, and Catholics” in the Know-Nothing context.

**Suggested placement:** Adams–Quincy MEM if it discusses the 1820s–30s contest; Lincoln MEM only if adding a secondary-source citation of Lincoln’s words (redundant given we now have Lincoln primary verbatim in MEM–AMERICA–PRESIDENT–LINCOLN).

**Action:** Optional. Prefer primary Lincoln in Lincoln MEM; use Schlesinger in Adams–Quincy only if MEM thematizes the Jacksonian overturn and a verbatim from *The Age of Jackson* on Adams/elites is found.

- **A Thousand Days: John F. Kennedy in the White House** (1965) (as applicable)
- **The Imperial Presidency** (1973; rev. 1989, 2004) (as applicable)

Then SOURCE blocks using those titles may use (ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-SECONDARY] without ARC–DISCOVERY.
