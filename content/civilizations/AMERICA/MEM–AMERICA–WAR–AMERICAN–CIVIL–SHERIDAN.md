I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves Philip Henry Sheridan as **America's eastern
theatre total-war executor**: the Union cavalry commander who
applied Grant's attrition logic to the Shenandoah Valley (1864)—
destroying Confederate food and supply and making the Valley "a
barren waste"—and who in 1865 drove the cavalry that cut Lee's
escape routes, forcing the surrender at Appomattox.

Sheridan does not win by single battle.
He **denies recovery and closes the trap**.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. ROLE & ORIGIN
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Sheridan emerges as Grant's instrument in the East after Sherman
and Grant shift to Virginia.

Context:
• Ohio; West Point; infantry then cavalry; western theatre (Perryville,
  Stones River, Chickamauga, Chattanooga)
• 1864: Grant brings Sheridan east; command of Army of the Shenandoah
• 1864 Valley Campaign; 1865 Appomattox campaign—cavalry as
  decisive arm for pursuit and severance
• Post-war: Reconstruction (Texas/Louisiana), Indian Wars; Commanding
  General of the Army (1884–1888)

Sheridan executes the same logic as Sherman—war against capacity and
supply—but in the eastern theatre, directly supporting Grant's
pressure on Lee.

Grant, in his *Personal Memoirs* (1885), on his September 1864 meeting
with Sheridan in the Valley and the campaign that followed:

SOURCE — Grant, *Personal Memoirs of U. S. Grant* (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD):
> "Now one of the main objects of the expedition began to be accomplished. Sheridan went to work with his command, gathering in the crops, cattle, and everything in the upper part of the valley required by our troops; and especially taking what might be of use to the enemy. What he could not take away he destroyed, so that the enemy would not be invited to come back there."
> — Ulysses S. Grant, *Personal Memoirs of U. S. Grant*, Vol. 2 (New York: Charles L. Webster, 1885), Ch. 58 (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD) [ERC-PRIMARY].

III. SHENANDOAH VALLEY 1864 & APPOMATTOX CAMPAIGN
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Sheridan's campaigns encode mobility, destruction of capacity, and
closure.

Elements:
• **Shenandoah Valley (Aug–Oct 1864)** — Grant's order: destroy
  Confederate food and supply; deny the Valley as base and corridor.
  Sheridan's campaign: Third Winchester, Fisher's Hill, Cedar Creek
  (Oct 19—"Sheridan's Ride" from Winchester to rally broken troops).
  Valley stripped of crops, mills, livestock; "The Valley has been
  made a barren waste." Confederate capacity and morale in the
  region collapse.
• **Appomattox campaign (Mar–Apr 1865)** — Sheridan's cavalry:
  Five Forks (Apr 1); seizure of key roads and rails; denial of
  Lee's western escape. Lee's army surrounded; surrender at
  Appomattox (Apr 9). Cavalry as **closure instrument**—speed and
  reach complete Grant's encirclement.

War against **capacity** in the East: Valley as breadbasket and
corridor neutralised; Lee's options reduced to surrender or
annihilation.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Sheridan encodes **eastern-theatre total war and cavalry as
closure**—the same logic as Sherman (deny capacity, break will)
applied in Virginia, under Grant, to force procedural termination
at Appomattox.

Lessons:
• Union can apply total-war logic in multiple theatres; Valley
  campaign parallels Sherman's march in purpose (capacity denial).
• Cavalry as instrument of pursuit and severance—mobility
  completes attrition; Sheridan cuts Lee's escape, Grant receives
  surrender.
• Civilian control holds: Sheridan executes Grant's and Lincoln's
  policy; Appomattox remains procedural.

V. MEM CONNECTIONS (MANDATORY)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
AMERICA:
• MEM–AMERICA–WAR–AMERICAN–CIVIL — Parent war; union preservation;
  attrition; Sheridan as Grant's eastern instrument.
• MEM–AMERICA–PRESIDENT–GRANT — Superior and strategist; Sheridan executes
  Valley and Appomattox campaign; Grant receives Lee's surrender.
• MEM–AMERICA–WAR–AMERICAN–CIVIL–SHERMAN — Parallel logic (total war
  against capacity); Sherman in South, Sheridan in Valley; same
  procedural frame.
• MEM–AMERICA–WAR–AMERICAN–CIVIL–LEE — Opponent; Valley and
  Appomattox; Lee's escape denied by Sheridan's cavalry; surrender.
• MEM–AMERICA–WAR–AMERICAN–CIVIL–STONEWALL–JACKSON — Contrast: Jackson
  made the Valley a Confederate weapon (1862); Sheridan makes it a
  barren waste (1864); same geography, opposite outcome.
• MEM–AMERICA–WAR–AMERICAN–CIVIL–APPOMATTOX — Sheridan's cavalry
  forces closure; Five Forks and encirclement; procedural termination.

Cross-Civilizational:
• MEM–ANGLIA–WAR–AMERICAN–CIVIL — Anglian encoding; same war;
  Sheridan as Union instrument in closing phase.

Cross-references denote lineage, not equivalence.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Sheridan: Valley 1864—barren waste; Cedar Creek; cavalry as
  closure at Appomattox; Five Forks.
• Eastern total war under Grant; same capacity-denial logic as
  Sherman; procedure and civilian control retained.
• Valley: Jackson's theatre (1862) becomes Sheridan's denial (1864).

Tension preserved without verdict.
