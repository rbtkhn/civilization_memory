I. PURPOSE & AUTHORITY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
(Implements CIV–SCHOLAR–TEMPLATE § I)

CIV–SCHOLAR–AMERICA is the accumulative learning ledger of the America
entity (United States). It records what was ingested, what beliefs were
extracted, and how beliefs were synthesized. No belief exists here unless
explicitly derived. No synthesis exists unless explicitly recorded.

**AMERICA AS ANGLIAN DERIVATIVE (BINDING NUANCE):**

America is derived from England. Pre-America Anglian culture and history
— English and British institutions, law, political thought, colonial
North American experience, and the civilizational grammar that preceded
1776 — are **core** to U.S. history and present. They are not "foreign"
or "comparative" context; they are constitutive. The United States is
Anglia unbound by island constraints (per MEM–ANGLIA–UNITED–STATES–
AMERICA). SCHOLAR–AMERICA therefore treats MEM–ANGLIA files as
**primary source for American learning**: ingestion of MEM–ANGLIA–* is
constitutive ingestion, especially where those MEMs cover pre-independence
Anglian experience, colonial North America, or inherited patterns
(procedure, common law, maritime and institutional power). MEM–AMERICA–*
files (when created) are ingested as America-specific. CIV–SCHOLAR–ANGLIA
and CIV–DOCTRINE–ANGLIA provide inherited learning and doctrinal context;
CIV–DOCTRINE–AMERICA (derived from CIV–DOCTRINE–ANGLIA) is the authoritative
American doctrine registry. They are loaded when analysing inherited grammar
or when America-specific synthesis builds on Anglian precedent.

Authority Flow (NON-REVERSIBLE): CIV–MEM–CORE → CIV–MEM–TEMPLATE →
CIV–SCHOLAR–TEMPLATE → CIV–SCHOLAR–AMERICA. No Scholar file may override
MEM law, ARC law, or Template law.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. SCHOLAR PHASE MODEL (HARD)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
(Implements CIV–SCHOLAR–TEMPLATE § II)

This file operates in **PHASE I — ACCUMULATION**.

Permitted: Learning ingestion (from MEM–ANGLIA–* as constitutive and
MEM–AMERICA–* when present); pattern recognition; comparative notes;
tension recording; hypothesis staging (non-binding). Forbidden: Doctrine
creation; verdicts; system claims; teleology. RLLs may be drafted but
are NOT binding in this phase.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. RLL AUTHORITY / DOCTRINE REGISTRY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
(Implements CIV–SCHOLAR–TEMPLATE § III; Phase I)

In Phase I, RLLs are not binding. This file may reference CIV–DOCTRINE–
AMERICA as **authoritative American doctrine** and CIV–DOCTRINE–ANGLIA as
**inherited doctrinal context** (doctrines 01–07 apply as American-adapted frame). America-specific doctrine entries may be added
here only when a synthesis is explicitly frozen and accepted per
Template. If Phase II is adopted, RLL–AMERICA–#### namespace and
binding rules apply per Template.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. FAILURE-FIRST STANDARD (PHASE II; PHASE I EXEMPT)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
(Implements CIV–SCHOLAR–TEMPLATE § IV)

Phase II requires failure-first reasoning and sequencing enforcement.
Phase I (current) is exempt.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. NON-SYNTHESIS RULE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
(Implements CIV–SCHOLAR–TEMPLATE § V)

Scholar files may record contradictions, juxtapose models, preserve
tensions. They may not resolve contradictions, harmonize models, or
produce unified theories. Constraint-oriented synthesis is permitted;
closure-seeking synthesis is forbidden.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. SCHOLAR ↔ MEM CONFLICT HANDLING
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
(Implements CIV–SCHOLAR–TEMPLATE § VI)

MEM facts are authoritative; SCHOLAR constraints are interpretive. When
a MEM assertion contradicts an established SCHOLAR pattern, the Scholar
must flag the anomaly explicitly. Authority substitution and silent
reconciliation are forbidden.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. CIVILIZATION-SCOPED PROMOTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
(Implements CIV–SCHOLAR–TEMPLATE § VII)

Phase promotion is entity-local. America’s promotion to Phase II is
independent of other civilizations.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VIII. SNAPSHOT CLASS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
(Implements CIV–SCHOLAR–TEMPLATE § VIII)

Snapshot naming: SCHOLAR–AMERICA — SNAPSHOT — vX.Y. Snapshots are
read-only, locked permanently, externalizable.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IX. COMMUNICATION REGISTER & VOICE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
(Implements CIV–SCHOLAR–TEMPLATE § IX)

LEARN mode: Mercouris prose (academic, recursive layering); LEARN/WRITE =
academic prose; IMAGINE = spoken per CIV–MIND–MERCOURIS III.L. Secondary
voice (Mearsheimer, Barnes) uses explicit markers per Template. Audit
commands: `mearsheimer audit [TARGET]`, `barnes audit [TARGET]` per
Template § IX.C–E.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
X. EPHEMERAL OBSERVATION LAYER
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
(Implements CIV–SCHOLAR–TEMPLATE § X)

Canonical layer: MEM-sourced learning (MEM–ANGLIA–* constitutive,
MEM–AMERICA–* when present). Ephemeral layer: CEO-sourced (current
events), EOR creation, no binding. Layer indicators: [LEARN: CANONICAL] /
[LEARN: EPHEMERAL].

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
XI. OGE SPECIFICATION (EMBEDDED)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
(Implements CIV–SCHOLAR–TEMPLATE § XI.A)

LEARN mode uses OGE to direct discovery. Exactly 8 options (A–H) per
substantive turn; 10–20 words each; concrete anchor per option. A/B/C:
load MIND when selected; D: multi-mind; E: traverse backward (same-civ
MEM — for America, MEM–ANGLIA–* constitutive and MEM–AMERICA–*); F:
traverse forward; G: traverse cross-civ; H: synthesis + recap. POST-BARNES:
M/M response options. Ingestion options include MEM–ANGLIA–* (constitutive
for America) and MEM–AMERICA–* and cross-civilization MEMs for comparison.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
XII. VERSIONING & GOVERNANCE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
(Implements CIV–SCHOLAR–TEMPLATE § XII)

Additive upgrades only; no deletions. Phase changes and doctrine freezes
require explicit authorization.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
XIII. CONTEXT LOADING PROTOCOLS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
(Implements CIV–SCHOLAR–TEMPLATE § XIII)

**Constitutive load:** MEM–ANGLIA–* are admissible as primary source for
American learning (pre-America Anglian culture and history are core).
MEM–AMERICA–* (when present) are admissible as America-specific.

**Doctrine and inherited learning:** CIV–DOCTRINE–ANGLIA and CIV–SCHOLAR–
ANGLIA loaded when analysing inherited grammar or when synthesis builds
on Anglian precedent.

**ARC:** CIV–ARC–ANGLIA when writing or analysing content that cites
Anglian or pre-America period. CIV–ARC–AMERICA when citing America-
specific current or institutional sources (STATE mode or MEM–AMERICA).

LEARN mode minimal: this file + target MEMs (MEM–ANGLIA–* or MEM–AMERICA–*);
on-demand access to CIV–SCHOLAR–ANGLIA, CIV–DOCTRINE–ANGLIA, CIV–CORE–
AMERICA (primary), CIV–CORE–ANGLIA (inherited context).

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
XIV. SYNTHESIS TRADECRAFT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
(Implements CIV–SCHOLAR–TEMPLATE § XIV)

Frozen SYNTHESIS entries require Assumptions Box (≥3 assumptions,
linchpin status), Confidence tier, and (when alternatives evaluated)
ACH Record.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
XV. INITIAL STATE — AMERICA AS ANGLIAN DERIVATIVE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
America is derived from England. Pre-America Anglian culture and history
are **core** to U.S. history and present: English and British institutions,
law, political thought, colonial North American experience, and the
civilizational grammar that preceded independence are constitutive, not
external. The Scholar learns from MEM–ANGLIA files (constitutive for
America) and MEM–AMERICA files (when present). Absence of ingestion
equals absence of belief beyond this inherited frame.

**Assumed structural prior:** Inherited grammar from Anglian experience
— procedure as memory, defeat without legitimacy collapse when exit is
procedural, coalition primacy, time as weapon, naval denial — as
documented in CIV–DOCTRINE–ANGLIA and CIV–SCHOLAR–ANGLIA. This prior
does not substitute for explicit ingestion; it frames what counts as
constitutive (MEM–ANGLIA–*) and what counts as America-specific
(MEM–AMERICA–*).

CIV–CORE: CIV–CORE–AMERICA v1.0 is the primary CORE for America (axioms,
legitimacy accounting, failure physics). CIV–CORE–ANGLIA may be consulted
for inherited axiom structure when relevant.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
XVI. INGESTED LEARNING EVENTS (CHRONOLOGICAL)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Entries record ingestion from MEM–ANGLIA–* (constitutive) and MEM–
AMERICA–* (when present). Pre-America Anglian sources are ingested as
core to American learning.

ENTRY 0001
Source:
• MEM–ANGLIA–UNITED–STATES–AMERICA — v1.1
Ingest Type:
• Constitutive — America as Anglian heir
Primary Belief Extracted:
• The United States is Anglia unbound by island constraints;
  procedural, legal, and strategic grammar inherited and scaled
  to continental and then global magnitude. Independence is
  institutional continuity, not rupture.
Belief Status:
• UNFROZEN

ENTRY 0002
Source:
• MEM–ANGLIA–LAW–MAGNA–CARTA — v1.0
Ingest Type:
• Constitutive — Pre-America Anglian constraint as core to US grammar
Primary Belief Extracted:
• Sovereign authority can be constrained procedurally without
  collapsing regime legitimacy. This pre-America Anglian pattern
  is core to U.S. constitutional and institutional grammar.
Belief Status:
• UNFROZEN

ENTRY 0003
Source:
• MEM–ANGLIA–COMMON–LAW — v1.0
Ingest Type:
• Constitutive — Pre-America Anglian legal continuity
Primary Belief Extracted:
• Law functions as accumulated memory through precedent, enabling
  adaptation without systemic reset. American law inherits this
  as core, not import.
Belief Status:
• UNFROZEN

ENTRY 0004
Source:
• MEM–ANGLIA–DECLARATION–INDEPENDENCE — v1.0
Ingest Type:
• Constitutive — Secession as institutional continuity
Primary Belief Extracted:
• American independence preserves form while rejecting command;
  break from Crown sovereignty, continuity of representative
  assemblies and procedural legitimacy. Revolution as institutional
  continuity, not civilizational reset.
Belief Status:
• UNFROZEN

ENTRY 0005
Source:
• MEM–ANGLIA–MONROE — v1.0
Ingest Type:
• Constitutive — Hemispheric perimeter as Anglian-style declarative order
Primary Belief Extracted:
• Hemisphere perimeter declared before full capacity; doctrine as
  signal; power signaled before possessed. Anglian practice of
  early declaration backed by future capacity, applied to U.S.
  hemispheric role.
Belief Status:
• UNFROZEN

ENTRY 0006
Source:
• MEM–ANGLIA–WAR–AMERICAN–INDEPENDENCE–YORKTOWN — v1.3
Ingest Type:
• Constitutive — Procedural exit and defeat without collapse
Primary Belief Extracted:
• British exit at Yorktown encoded procedurally; defeat does not
  require legitimacy collapse when exit is managed institutionally.
  Precedent for both Anglian and American grammar (retrenchment,
  recalibration as strategic option).
Belief Status:
• UNFROZEN

ENTRY 0007
Source:
• SCHOLAR–AMERICA LEARN session — Kennedy administration foreign policy
  doctrine audit (February 2026); MEM–ANGLIA–MONROE, MEM–ANGLIA–WAR–
  SPANISH–AMERICAN, MEM–RUSSIA–USSR–CUBAN–MISSILE–CRISIS (cross-civ)
Ingest Type:
• America-specific — Doctrine application and precedent
Primary Belief Extracted:
• Kennedy-era foreign policy (1961–1963) aligns with CIV–DOCTRINE–
  AMERICA 03–07; procedure was bypassed at Bay of Pigs then restored
  via ExComm and OAS (Doctrine 01). Quarantine (Oct 1962) fits
  Doctrine 06 (denial) and 05 (coalition). Monroe and Spanish–
  American War (MEM–ANGLIA–MONROE, MEM–ANGLIA–WAR–SPANISH–AMERICAN)
  set precedent for legitimacy of U.S. coercion in the hemisphere;
  humanitarian and reputational cost of blockade remains a tension.

  AMERICA–JACKSON, MEM–AMERICA–WAR–AMERICAN–CIVIL–FORT–SUMTER, MEM–
  AMERICA–WAR–AMERICAN–CIVIL–APPOMATTOX
Ingest Type:
• America-specific — Pattern: legitimacy density
Primary Belief Extracted:
• Legitimacy density = where legitimacy is concentrated (institution,
  person, doctrine, outcome) and how thick that claim is. Washington:
  procedure and voluntary surrender. Jackson: person and popular will.
  Nixon–Kissinger: order and outcome (summits, détente, Paris). Low
  points: 1861–1865 (contested sovereignty); 1973–1974 (executive
  collapse, procedure held). Fort Sumter = point of no return for
  contested legitimacy; Appomattox = procedural termination and
  reallocation (reintegration, "countrymen again").
Belief Status:
• UNFROZEN

ENTRY 0009
Source:
• SCHOLAR–AMERICA LEARN session — CIV–DOCTRINE–AMERICA read; Doctrine 07
  (myth as stabilizer) and legitimacy density; Gettysburg, Second
  Inaugural, Appomattox, post-Vietnam (February 2026); CIV–DOCTRINE–
  AMERICA; MEM–AMERICA–WAR–AMERICAN–CIVIL–GETTYSBURG, MEM–AMERICA–
  WAR–AMERICAN–CIVIL–APPOMATTOX, MEM–AMERICA–LINCOLN
Ingest Type:
• America-specific — Doctrine 07 and legitimacy density
Primary Belief Extracted:
• Doctrine 07 (myth as stabilizer, not engine) operates in two modes:
  myth during crisis (Gettysburg 1863—outcome in doubt) and myth after
  outcome failure (post-Vietnam). At termination, Second Inaugural
  ("malice toward none") and Grant's Appomattox terms align—myth sets
  frame, procedure executes. Hard constraint: myth collapses if
  contradicted by procedure. Legitimacy density (outcome-based) and 07:
  when outcome fails, myth stabilises rearguard only if procedure held.

• UNFROZEN

ENTRY 0010
Source:
• STATE–AMERICA session harvest (February 2026) — Taiwan decision-point

  was omitted in first pass; governance hardening (CIV–STATE–TEMPLATE
  v3.3, CHANGELOG 00007). CIV–DOCTRINE–AMERICA 03; CIV–STATE–TEMPLATE
  X-B; duty of competence.
Ingest Type:
• STATE harvest — decision-point option-set completeness and Doctrine 03
Primary Belief Extracted:
• American strategic grammar contains exit and retrenchment as valid
  options (Doctrine 03, CIV–CORE exit-building meta-doctrine, Nixon/
  Vietnam precedent). Option production in decision-point exercises can
  nevertheless default to commitment-weighted sets (sustain, adjust,
  condition) and omit the accommodation/reversal end of the spectrum
  unless explicitly forced. Systemic fix: require at least one
  accommodation/reversal option when the decision involves a commitment
  (alliance, arms, presence, confrontation), with one-line documentation
  (duty of competence; Doctrine 03). Template and cursor rule updated
  accordingly (X-B step 8; cmc-state-mem-grounding).

Ingest Type:
• America-specific — option set as encoding device; cross-civ parallel
Primary Belief Extracted:
• Whether reversal is encoded as choice or as collapse depends on
  whether "we might give it up" was ever a legitimate, briefed option.
  Where it was (Nixon/Paris 1973, Kutuzov 1812, Yorktown reframed as
  procedural exit), reversal encodes as strategy. Where it was not
  (Lord North/no "settle with Congress," Napoleon post-Trafalgar and
  Sixth Coalition, Russia post-Tsushima), reversal encodes as defeat or
  humiliation. Option set functions as encoding device for legitimacy
  (Doctrine 01) and for defeat-without-collapse (Doctrine 03). Cross-civ
  parallel: Francia (performance-based legitimacy, no "settle" option →
  collapse); Russia (Kutuzov = reversal as option → strength; Russo–
  Japanese = reversal forced → humiliation). Tensions preserved:
  legitimacy vs structure vs liability.

  MEM–AMERICA–MONROE (February 2026).
Ingest Type:
• America-specific / constitutive (Anglian Suez) — perimeter reversal
  and encoding
Primary Belief Extracted:
• When a declarative perimeter or strategic node is reversed, encoding
  can be (a) choice (if accommodation/reversal was a briefed option and
  taken) or (b) forced loss that is survivable (Suez 1956: Britain lost
  the canal; MEM encodes "loss without collapse," "you can lose the
  lifeline and live"). Roosevelt Corollary strengthened Monroe (no
  relaxation). Nixon/Kissinger preserved Monroe while supplementing
  beyond hemisphere. The main perimeter-reversal case in the corpus is
  Suez: forced loss encoded as survivable. Protocol implication: for
  declarative perimeters (Monroe, nodal control), include "relax
  enforcement" or "negotiate exit" as an option so that if the polity
  later steps back, it can be encoded as choice or managed exit; Suez
  shows that forced loss can still be encoded as survivable.

  (Mercouris), E (backward Albany/1763), G (Francia, Russia, Germania),
  D (multi-mind), H (synthesis).
Ingest Type:
• America-specific / cross-civ — assembly-under-pressure encodings
Primary Belief Extracted:
• Assembly-under-pressure is encoded in four ways across the corpus:
  **anchor** (Continental Congress—procedure plus war and state
  compliance; Olive Branch, Washington, Declaration); **reset**
  (Estates-General 1789—legitimacy replaced in one move; National
  Assembly, Rousseau); **contained** (Russian Duma post-1905, zemstvo—
  form without genuine power transfer; Nicholas II); **overrun**
  (Frankfurt Parliament 1848, Paulskirche—"words lost" to Prussia and
  Austria; Clark). Procedure alone does not fix outcome; what matters
  is whether the assembly is backed by force/administration, is the
  vehicle of rupture, is deliberately constrained, or is left without
  any of those. Four encodings preserved; no single rule explains all.

XVII. BELIEF SYNTHESIS LOG
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Inherited doctrinal context: CIV–DOCTRINE–ANGLIA (doctrines 01–07).

SYNTHESIS 0001 (candidate — from LEARN session Mississippi sequence)
  Outcome: Control of the mouth of the Mississippi is a necessary
  condition for continental union and for the U.S. "internal ocean"
  as legitimacy asset and strategic fact. The river system cannot
  be partially owned; 1763–1863 sequence (Spain at mouth → Pinckney
  → Louisiana Purchase → Vicksburg) confirms chokepoint logic.
  Status: UNFROZEN · CANDIDATE (hypothesis staging, Phase I)
  Confidence: TIER 2 (70–90% — pattern strongly supported by MEM–
  ANGLIA–GEO–MISSISSIPPI–RIVER and by historical sequence; not
  yet independently stress-tested)

  ASSUMPTIONS BOX:
  • Assumption 1: The mouth is the single decisive chokepoint for
    the Mississippi system — if falsified (e.g. alternative routes
    or technologies that bypass the mouth), the synthesis overstates
    necessity. Linchpin: High.
  • Assumption 2: The historical sequence (1763, 1795, 1803, 1862–63)
    is generalizable as "control of mouth → control of interior" —
    if falsified (e.g. cases where interior held without mouth), the
    synthesis is period-specific. Linchpin: Medium.
  • Assumption 3: Legitimacy (union narrative) and structure
    (force ratio at chokepoint) are both served by the same geographic
    fact — if falsified (e.g. legitimacy sustained without control),
    the synthesis overstates the link. Linchpin: Medium.

  Source: SCHOLAR–AMERICA LEARN session (Mearsheimer audit, multi-mind
  Civil War, Options E traversal 1763 → 1795 → 1803; MEM–ANGLIA–
  GEO–MISSISSIPPI–RIVER constitutive). Do not treat as doctrine
  unless explicitly frozen per Template.

SYNTHESIS 0002 (candidate — from LEARN session Kennedy doctrine audit)
  Outcome: U.S. coercion in the hemisphere is legitimised by perimeter
  declaration (Monroe) and liberation/procedural framing (Spanish–
  American War, Cuban Missile Crisis). Humanitarian and reputational
  cost of blockade or intervention is a persistent tension that the
  legitimacy narrative does not remove.
  Status: UNFROZEN · CANDIDATE (hypothesis staging, Phase I)
  Confidence: TIER 2 (70–90% — pattern supported by MEM–ANGLIA–
  MONROE, MEM–ANGLIA–WAR–SPANISH–AMERICAN, and doctrine audit session;
  not yet independently stress-tested)

  ASSUMPTIONS BOX:
  • Assumption 1: Monroe and 1898 establish a reusable template for
    legitimising coercion (perimeter + procedural/humanitarian framing)
    — if falsified (e.g. later periods reject the template), the
    synthesis is period-specific. Linchpin: Medium.
  • Assumption 2: Humanitarian and reputational cost is a structural
    tension, not eliminable by better framing — if falsified (e.g.
    cases where cost is fully neutralised), the synthesis overstates
    the tension. Linchpin: Medium.
  • Assumption 3: The same precedent that enables legitimacy claims
    (Monroe, 1898) also fuels counter-narratives (coercion, imperialism)
    in other audiences — if falsified (e.g. no audience divergence),
    the synthesis overstates the split. Linchpin: Low.

  Source: SCHOLAR–AMERICA LEARN session (Kennedy doctrine audit;
  options A, B, C, E, H; MEM–ANGLIA–MONROE, MEM–ANGLIA–WAR–SPANISH–
  AMERICAN, MEM–RUSSIA–USSR–CUBAN–MISSILE–CRISIS). Do not treat as
  doctrine unless explicitly frozen per Template.

SYNTHESIS 0003 (candidate — from LEARN session doctrine violations)
  Outcome: When CIV–DOCTRINE–AMERICA is blatantly violated, the
  system sometimes corrects rather than compounds: procedure
  reasserts (Bay of Pigs → ExComm; Watergate → oversight; Iran–
  Contra → investigations), defeat is eventually processed (Vietnam
  exit), myth-as-engine failure reduces future appetite (Iraq), or
  the violation is later repudiated (Japanese internment, Civil
  Liberties Act 1988). Violations do not always cascade; corrective
  reassertion is a recurring pattern.
  Status: UNFROZEN · CANDIDATE (hypothesis staging, Phase I)
  Confidence: TIER 2 (70–90% — pattern supported by session
  examples; not yet independently stress-tested)

  ASSUMPTIONS BOX:
  • Assumption 1: Corrective reassertion depends on procedure
    remaining intact enough to be invoked — if procedure had
    fully collapsed, correction would not occur. Linchpin: High.
  • Assumption 2: The pattern is contingent on audience and
    institution (Congress, press, courts) — if those are
    neutered, violations may compound. Linchpin: Medium.
  • Assumption 3: Repudiation (e.g. internment redress) is
    slower and less guaranteed than procedure reassertion —
    if falsified (e.g. all violations get formal redress), the
    synthesis understates the gap. Linchpin: Low.

  Source: SCHOLAR–AMERICA LEARN session (doctrine violations,
  surprising results; Yorktown, Canada, Option C; options A, D, E,
  H). Do not treat as doctrine unless explicitly frozen per Template.

SYNTHESIS 0004 (candidate — from LEARN session legitimacy density)
  Outcome: Legitimacy density (where legitimacy is concentrated and how
  thick the claim is) varies across American eras. Washington: dense in
  procedure and voluntary surrender (Annapolis, term limits). Jackson:
  dense in person and popular will (electoral mandate, veto, spoils).
  Civil War: nadir at order level—contested sovereignty; Fort Sumter
  fixes the split; Appomattox reallocates via procedural termination
  (Grant's terms, reintegration, "countrymen again"). Nixon–Kissinger:
  dense in order and outcome (summits, détente, Paris); outcome-
  dependent, more contestable when outcomes fail (e.g. Saigon 1975).
  1973–1974: nadir at executive level; procedure holds (resignation,
  succession). Low legitimacy density is structurally dangerous when
  the state cannot credibly commit resources or when "who is the
  state" is contested (civil war vs contained rupture).
  Status: UNFROZEN · CANDIDATE (hypothesis staging, Phase I)
  Confidence: TIER 2 (70–90% — pattern supported by MEM–AMERICA–
  WASHINGTON, MEM–AMERICA–JACKSON, MEM–AMERICA–KISSINGER, MEM–
  AMERICA–NIXON, MEM–AMERICA–WAR–AMERICAN–CIVIL–FORT–SUMTER, MEM–
  AMERICA–WAR–AMERICAN–CIVIL–APPOMATTOX; 19th-century stress-test
  applied Feb 2026 — loci hold, cases often composite)

  ASSUMPTIONS BOX:
  • Assumption 1: The four loci (procedure, person, doctrine, outcome)
    are sufficiently distinct to track variation across eras — if
    falsified (e.g. always composite), the synthesis overstates
    clarity. Linchpin: Medium.
  • Assumption 2: Outcome-based legitimacy is more contestable when
    outcomes fail than procedure- or person-based — if falsified
    (e.g. procedure equally fragile), the synthesis overstates the
    contrast. Linchpin: Medium.
  • Assumption 3: 1861–1865 and 1973–1974 are valid comparators for
    "low" legitimacy density (order-level vs executive-level) — if
    falsified (e.g. other nadirs dominate), the synthesis is
    period-specific. Linchpin: Low.

  Source: SCHOLAR–AMERICA LEARN session (Kissinger cluster; options
  A, B, D, E, F, H; Mearsheimer primary then multi-mind; legitimacy
  density unpacked; low points; Fort Sumter; Appomattox). Do not
  treat as doctrine unless explicitly frozen per Template.

  19th-century stress-test (February 2026): SYNTHESIS 0004 tested
  against MEM–AMERICA–MONROE, MEM–AMERICA–WAR–1812, MEM–AMERICA–
  WAR–MEXICAN–AMERICAN, MEM–AMERICA–LINCOLN, MEM–AMERICA–GRANT.
  Result: four loci hold; cases often composite (two loci at once).
  Monroe: doctrine + procedure. War of 1812: procedure (outcome
  stalemate—procedure carries when outcome neutral). Mexican–
  American: procedure channels outcome (conquest absorbed by
  treaty). Lincoln: person + procedure. Grant: outcome + procedure
  (Appomattox). Refinement: procedure can carry density when
  outcome is neutral; empirical cases often hybrid.

  Proposed RLL (Phase I — NOT BINDING): RLL–AMERICA–0001 (Legitimacy
  Density Variation) — American legitimacy claims vary in locus
  (procedure, person, doctrine, outcome); outcome-based density is
  more vulnerable to outcome failure. Binding only if Phase II
  adopted and synthesis frozen.

CONCEPT REGISTRY (non-binding):
• legitimacy density — Analytical concept: the concentration and
  thickness of legitimacy claims; where they sit (institution, person,
  doctrine, outcome) and how robust to failure. See SYNTHESIS 0004,
  ENTRY 0008. Use for cross-era comparison (Washington, Jackson, Civil
  War, Nixon–Kissinger).
• Doctrine 07 (myth) and legitimacy density — Myth as stabilizer
  operates during crisis (Gettysburg) or after outcome failure
  (post-Vietnam); at termination myth and procedure can align (Second
  Inaugural + Appomattox). Myth collapses if procedure contradicts.
  See SYNTHESIS 0005, ENTRY 0009.

SYNTHESIS 0005 (candidate — from LEARN session Doctrine 07 and legitimacy density)
  Outcome: CIV–DOCTRINE–AMERICA Doctrine 07 (myth as stabilizer, not
  engine) interacts with legitimacy density in two distinct modes.
  (1) Myth during crisis: at Gettysburg (Nov 1863) Lincoln's Address
  stabilises morale and legitimacy while outcome is still in doubt;
  myth binds sacrifice to "government of the people" without creating
  victory. (2) Myth after outcome failure: when legitimacy is
  outcome-based (e.g. Nixon–Kissinger "peace with honor") and the
  outcome fails (Saigon 1975), myth operates as rearguard—narratives
  stabilise only if procedure (succession, Congress) already held.
  (3) Myth and procedure aligned at termination: Second Inaugural
  ("malice toward none," "bind up the nation's wounds") sets the
  frame; Grant's Appomattox terms execute it (parole, no imprisonment,
  "countrymen again"). Mutual validation: myth authorises procedure;
  procedure validates myth. Hard constraint (Doctrine 07): myth
  collapses if contradicted by procedure.
  Status: UNFROZEN · CANDIDATE (hypothesis staging, Phase I)
  Confidence: TIER 2 (70–90% — pattern supported by CIV–DOCTRINE–
  AMERICA 07; MEM–AMERICA–WAR–AMERICAN–CIVIL–GETTYSBURG, MEM–
  AMERICA–WAR–AMERICAN–CIVIL–APPOMATTOX, MEM–AMERICA–LINCOLN; not
  yet independently stress-tested)

  ASSUMPTIONS BOX:
  • Assumption 1: The two modes (myth during crisis vs after outcome
    failure) are sufficiently distinct to guide application — if
    falsified (e.g. always same function), the synthesis overstates
    the contrast. Linchpin: Medium.
  • Assumption 2: Alignment at Appomattox (Second Inaugural + Grant's
    terms) is generalizable as template for myth–procedure coherence
    at war termination — if falsified (e.g. unique to Civil War),
    the synthesis is period-specific. Linchpin: Low.
  • Assumption 3: Doctrine 07's hard constraint (myth collapses if
    procedure contradicts) holds across cases — if falsified (e.g.
    myth sometimes survives procedure rupture), the synthesis
    overstates the constraint. Linchpin: Medium.

  Do not treat as doctrine unless explicitly frozen per Template.

SYNTHESIS 0006 (candidate — from LEARN session assembly-under-pressure)
  Outcome: Assembly-under-pressure is encoded in four ways across the
  corpus; procedure alone does not determine outcome. **Anchor:**
  Continental Congress — procedure plus war and state compliance (Olive
  Branch, Washington, Declaration). **Reset:** Estates-General 1789 —
  legitimacy replaced in one move (National Assembly, Rousseau). **Contained:**
  Russian Duma post-1905, zemstvo — form without genuine power transfer
  (Nicholas II). **Overrun:** Frankfurt Parliament 1848, Paulskirche —
  "words lost" to Prussia and Austria (Clark). What matters is whether
  the assembly is backed by force/administration, is the vehicle of
  rupture, is deliberately constrained, or is left without any of those.
  Status: UNFROZEN · CANDIDATE (hypothesis staging, Phase I)
  Confidence: TIER 2 (70–90% — pattern supported by ENTRY 0013 and
  traversed MEMs; cross-civ; not yet independently stress-tested)

  ASSUMPTIONS BOX:
  • Assumption 1: The four encodings (anchor, reset, contained, overrun)
    are distinct and not reducible to a single variable — if falsified
    (e.g. one dimension predicts all), the synthesis overstates
    typological richness. Linchpin: Medium.
  • Assumption 2: The cases are representative of their civilizational
    grammars (America, Francia, Russia, Germania) — if falsified (e.g.
    other assemblies in same civs encode differently), the synthesis
    is case-specific. Linchpin: Medium.
  • Assumption 3: "Procedure alone does not fix outcome" generalizes
    beyond these four — if falsified (e.g. strong proceduralism
    elsewhere), the synthesis overstates the limit of procedure.
    Linchpin: Low.

XVIII. DOCTRINE REGISTRY (AMERICA-SPECIFIC)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
No America-specific doctrines frozen. Inherited context: CIV–
DOCTRINE–ANGLIA (Procedure as Memory, Rupture Absorption, Defeat
Without Collapse, Time as Weapon, Coalition Primacy, Naval Denial,
Myth as Stabilizer) applies as Anglian-derived frame. America-
specific doctrine entries require explicit freeze and acceptance
per Template.

XIX. SCHOLAR DIVERGENCE INDEX (SDI)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
No SDI entries yet. When comparative analysis is recorded (e.g.
America ↔ other civilization), entries will be added here. America
↔ Anglia is derivative, not divergence — pre-America Anglian material
is constitutive.

XXII. TEMPLATE INHERITANCE & CONSTRAINTS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file conforms to CIV–SCHOLAR–TEMPLATE v3.2 (sections I–XIV).
Sections XV–XXII retain ledger content. No sections removed. No
authority expanded. The binding nuance — America as Anglian derivative,
pre-America Anglian culture/history as core — is stated in Section I
and Section XV and governs all ingestion and context loading.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
XXIII. VERSIONING & CANONICAL STATUS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
v1.0 (February 2026): Initial creation. America as Anglian derivative
nuance; constitutive ingestion of MEM–ANGLIA–*; six seed entries
(UNITED–STATES–AMERICA, MAGNA CARTA, COMMON LAW, DECLARATION–
INDEPENDENCE, MONROE, YORKTOWN). No America-specific doctrines.
STATE–AMERICA and MEM–RELEVANCE–AMERICA updated to reference
CIV–SCHOLAR–AMERICA.

v1.1 (February 2026): ENTRY 0008 (LEARN session Kissinger cluster,
legitimacy density, Fort Sumter–Appomattox). SYNTHESIS 0004
(candidate): legitimacy density across eras (Washington, Jackson,
Civil War, Nixon–Kissinger); low points; procedural termination.
Proposed RLL–AMERICA–0001 (Phase I, not binding). CONCEPT REGISTRY
(non-binding): legitimacy density.

v1.2 (February 2026): ENTRY 0009 (LEARN session CIV–DOCTRINE–AMERICA
read; Doctrine 07 and legitimacy density; Gettysburg, Appomattox,
Second Inaugural, post-Vietnam). SYNTHESIS 0005 (candidate): Doctrine
07 (myth as stabilizer) in two modes—myth during crisis (Gettysburg)
and myth after outcome failure (post-Vietnam); alignment at
termination (Second Inaugural + Appomattox terms); hard constraint
when procedure contradicts myth. CONCEPT REGISTRY: Doctrine 07 and
legitimacy density.

Future versions may: Add entries; add syntheses; freeze doctrines.
Future versions may NOT: Remove content; reorder sections; retroactively
edit beliefs; weaken the America-as-Anglian-derivative principle.
