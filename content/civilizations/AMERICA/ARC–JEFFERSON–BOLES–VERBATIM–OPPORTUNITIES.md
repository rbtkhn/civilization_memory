## 1. MEM–AMERICA–WASHINGTON

**Thematic fit:** "First great generation" (Washington, Adams, Jefferson); Washington as restraint figure, Jefferson as ideological articulation; "Washington practices, Jefferson theorizes." No Jefferson voice yet in this MEM.

**Suggested placement:** §II (Origin Conditions) after Churchill, or §V (Anti-Napoleonic Archetype) — contrast with continental revolutionary charisma.

**Candidate — Jefferson primary:** Letter or Autobiography passage on Washington's character (e.g. refusal of power, precedent-setting). Example theme: Jefferson on Washington's voluntary surrender of command or on his "republican moderation." *Locate ≥25-word passage in Jefferson papers or Autobiography.*

**Candidate — Boles:** Passage on the Washington-Jefferson relationship (collaboration, then divergence over Federalism); or Boles on Washington as the one who "practiced" what Jefferson "theorized." *Search Boles index for "Washington."*

**Citation:** Jefferson (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD) [ERC-PRIMARY]; Boles, *Jefferson: Architect of American Liberty* (Basic Books, 2017) (ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-SECONDARY].

---

## 2. MEM–AMERICA–ADAMS

**Thematic fit:** Triad (Washington, Adams, Jefferson); "Jefferson as ideological articulation, Adams as legal and diplomatic executor"; Declaration drafting with Jefferson; first peaceful transfer Adams → Jefferson 1801.

**Suggested placement:** §III (Lawyer & Procedural Rebel) — Declaration drafting; or §IV (Diplomat & Recognition) — transition of 1801.

**Candidate — Jefferson primary:** Letter to or about Adams (reconciliation in later years, or on the Declaration); or Jefferson's account of the Declaration drafting (Autobiography). *Autobiography contains drafting narrative; letters to Adams (e.g. 1812–1826) on founding and legacy.*

**Candidate — Boles:** Passage on the Adams-Jefferson partnership or the 1801 transition as "procedure over person." *Search Boles for "Adams," "1801," "transition."*

**Citation:** Jefferson (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD) [ERC-PRIMARY]; Boles (ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-SECONDARY].

---

## 3. MEM–AMERICA–MADISON

**Thematic fit:** "Madison engineers what Jefferson declares"; §V "CONTRAST WITH JEFFERSON" — structure over rhetoric, procedure over declaration. Ideal to ground the contrast in Jefferson's own words.

**Suggested placement:** §V (Contrast with Jefferson) — add Jefferson verbatim *before* or *after* the contrast bullets so the MEM cites Jefferson's abstraction directly.

**Candidate — Jefferson primary:** Passage on government resting on virtue or popular will vs. institutional design; or on "the people" as moral source. *Notes on Virginia or letters on republican government; avoid long doctrinal tracts; aim for one crisp ≥25-word sentence or two.*

**Candidate — Boles:** Passage on the Jefferson-Madison partnership (ideology vs. structure; Boles treats both). *Search Boles for "Madison," "Constitution," "Federalist."*

**Citation:** Jefferson (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD) [ERC-PRIMARY]; Boles (ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-SECONDARY].

---

## 4. MEM–AMERICA–MONROE

**Thematic fit:** "Monroe operationalizes what Jefferson theorizes"; §VI "CONTRAST WITH JEFFERSON" — boundary setting over ideology; MEM connections already tie to Jefferson.

**Suggested placement:** §VI (Contrast with Jefferson) — add Jefferson verbatim on territorial expansion or hemispheric vision so Monroe's "operationalization" answers a stated Jefferson ideal.

**Candidate — Jefferson primary:** "Empire of liberty" language; or Louisiana Purchase rationale (security, outlet for yeoman farmers); or letter on western expansion. *Widely cited; locate exact ≥25-word passage in Jefferson papers.*

**Candidate — Boles:** Passage on Jefferson's territorial vision and Monroe as heir; or on Louisiana Purchase as Jeffersonian policy. *Search Boles for "Louisiana," "Monroe," "expansion."*

**Citation:** Jefferson (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD) [ERC-PRIMARY]; Boles (ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-SECONDARY].

---

## 5. MEM–AMERICA–WAR–AMERICAN–INDEPENDENCE

**Thematic fit:** Declaration 1776 — "universalist register and alliance signal"; MEM connections list MEM–AMERICA–JEFFERSON (Declaration of Independence; legitimacy). War as defence of procedure against imperial overreach.

**Suggested placement:** §II (Strategic Entry: Grievance & Legitimacy Frame) — after the Declaration bullet; or new short subsection on Declaration authorship.

**Candidate — Jefferson primary:** Autobiography passage on drafting the Declaration (charge to the committee, purpose, or "harmonizing sentiments"); or letter on the meaning of independence. *Autobiography has drafting narrative; ≥25 words.*

**Candidate — Boles:** Passage on Jefferson's role in the Revolution/Declaration (e.g. "architect of American liberty" in the founding moment). *Boles opening or conclusion on Jefferson and the Declaration.*

**Citation:** Jefferson (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD) [ERC-PRIMARY]; Boles (ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-SECONDARY].

---

## 6. MEM–AMERICA–COLONIAL–PHILADELPHIA

**Thematic fit:** "Declaration author; Philadelphia 1776; Virginian in Pennsylvanian seat" (MEM connections); "July 4, 1776: Declaration of Independence — adopted in Philadelphia."

**Suggested placement:** §III (Continental Congress & Declaration) — after the sentence on July 4, 1776.

**Candidate — Jefferson primary:** Same as (5): Autobiography on drafting in Philadelphia, or brief line on Congress and the "harmonizing" of colonial sentiment. *Keeps Philadelphia as procedural centre with Jefferson's voice.*

**Candidate — Boles:** One sentence on Jefferson in Philadelphia 1776 (drafting, committee). *Short Boles excerpt on the drafting context.*

**Citation:** Jefferson (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD) [ERC-PRIMARY]; Boles (ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-SECONDARY].

---

## 7. MEM–AMERICA–JACKSON

**Thematic fit:** Jackson as populist rupture; "the people" as moral source; Schlesinger already present (Age of Jackson). Jefferson as ideological precursor — rights language, popular sovereignty — that Jackson later weaponizes.

**Suggested placement:** §II (Origin Conditions & Social Base) or §III (Populism as Legitimacy Claim) — Jefferson as intellectual ancestor of "the people" as source of authority.

**Candidate — Jefferson primary:** Passage on confidence in the people, or on majority will within republican form (e.g. from first inaugural or letter). *Avoid anachronistic "Jacksonian" reading; choose Jefferson's own universalist-populist formulation.*

**Candidate — Boles:** Passage on Jefferson's democratic legacy or on later figures (e.g. Jackson) inheriting Jeffersonian rhetoric. *Search Boles for "legacy," "Jacksonian," "democracy."*

**Citation:** Jefferson (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD) [ERC-PRIMARY]; Boles (ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-SECONDARY].

---

## 8. MEM–AMERICA–LINCOLN

**Thematic fit:** "Slavery unresolved at founding"; Lincoln reframes legitimacy; MEM–AMERICA–JEFFERSON already has "book of fate" — Lincoln MEM could cite founding contradiction explicitly via Jefferson.

**Suggested placement:** §II (Civilizational Position) — after or near "Slavery unresolved at founding"; one short Jefferson primary block as founding-era encoding of the tension Lincoln later resolves by force.

**Candidate — Jefferson primary:** The "book of fate" sentence (or a variant) could be *quoted in LINCOLN* as the founding moment's own acknowledgment: "nothing is more certainly written in the book of fate than that these people are to be free." *Same passage as in JEFFERSON MEM; cross-reference acceptable; or choose a different Jefferson slavery passage (e.g. Notes on Virginia) to avoid duplication.*

**Candidate — Boles:** Passage on Jefferson's slavery contradiction as "tragic" prehistory to the Civil War; or Boles on how "Jefferson's ideas would outlive him" including the unresolved slavery question. *Enriches "slavery unresolved at founding" with scholar's framing.*

**Citation:** Jefferson (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD) [ERC-PRIMARY]; Boles (ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-SECONDARY].

---

## 9. MEM–AMERICA–WAR–MEXICAN–AMERICAN

**Thematic fit:** MEM connections already list "MEM–AMERICA–JEFFERSON — Territorial vision; Louisiana Purchase." Manifest Destiny and continental expansion; war as "conquest absorbed by procedure."

**Suggested placement:** §II (Context: Texas, Border, Manifest Destiny) — before or after Keegan; Jefferson as ideological precedent for territorial expansion.

**Candidate — Jefferson primary:** "Empire of liberty" or Louisiana/western expansion passage (same candidate as Monroe MEM). *One Jefferson block can serve both MONROE and WAR–MEXICAN–AMERICAN if placed in each with distinct framing (Monroe = operationalizer; Mexican–American = expansion precedent).*

**Candidate — Boles:** Jefferson's territorial vision and its legacy through Monroe to Polk-era expansion. *Search Boles for "Louisiana," "expansion," "empire."*

**Citation:** Jefferson (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD) [ERC-PRIMARY]; Boles (ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-SECONDARY].

---

## 10. MEM–AMERICA–WAR–AMERICAN–CIVIL

**Thematic fit:** "Expansion and slavery; federal–state ambiguity embedded at founding"; "slavery deferred at founding; Civil War as deferred reckoning."

**Suggested placement:** §II or context section where "founding" and "slavery" are named — add one Jefferson or Boles block to anchor "deferred at founding" in a primary or authoritative secondary voice.

**Candidate — Jefferson primary:** Short "book of fate" excerpt or Notes on Virginia passage on slavery and future reckoning. *Same as (8): either quote Jefferson here as founding encoding or use Boles to frame.*

**Candidate — Boles:** Jefferson as tragic figure unable to resolve abolition/democracy/patriarchal responsibility; founding compromise and later reckoning. *Boles conclusion or slavery chapter.*

**Citation:** Jefferson (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD) [ERC-PRIMARY]; Boles (ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-SECONDARY].

---

## 11. MEM–AMERICA–GEO–MISSISSIPPI–RIVER

**Thematic fit:** Louisiana Purchase; Mississippi as strategic and commercial artery; MEM content notes "Louisiana Purchase."

**Suggested placement:** Section on Louisiana Purchase or federal control of the river — Jefferson primary on securing Mississippi access or on the Purchase.

**Candidate — Jefferson primary:** Letter or message on the importance of New Orleans/Mississippi to western settlement and union; or on the Purchase. *Locate ≥25-word passage.*

**Citation:** Jefferson (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD) [ERC-PRIMARY].
