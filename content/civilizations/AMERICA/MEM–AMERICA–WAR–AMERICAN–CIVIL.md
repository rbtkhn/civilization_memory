I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves the American Civil War as **America's union
preservation war**: the conflict in which the federal republic
denied secession, preserved constitutional continuity by force,
and resolved the slavery contradiction through war—emancipation,
attrition, and procedural termination at Appomattox (1865).

For America, the war is **procedure preserved at extreme cost**—
union indissoluble; secession illegitimate; victory as restoration,
not conquest.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. CONTEXT & TRIGGER: SECESSION VS. UNION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The war erupts from deferred contradictions and sovereignty dispute.

Context:
• Expansion and slavery; federal–state ambiguity embedded at founding
• Secession (1860–1861)—South Carolina and Confederacy assert
  lawful withdrawal; compact theory of union
• Union frame: **perpetual union**; secession as rebellion; war
  to restore authority and territory
• Lincoln: preserve the Union; elections continue; civilian control
  of military; procedure survives even at total-war scale

Both sides claim legality. The Union prevails by force and
legitimacy of federal authority.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. UNION WAR LOGIC & LEGITIMACY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Union fights to preserve process itself.

Characteristics:
• War under constitutional authority; Congress and president
• Elections (1864) during conflict—legitimacy renewed by ballot
• Civilian control of military; Lincoln and Grant relationship
• Emancipation (1863)—slavery reframed as legitimacy violation;
  war measure and moral alignment

Victory is defined as **continuity**—Constitution amended (Thirteenth),
not replaced; union authority affirmed as indissoluble.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. SCALE: INDUSTRIAL WAR & ATTRITION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The war transforms state capacity and military logic.

Elements:
• Mass mobilisation; continental distance (Keegan: "principal
  problem ... is that of distance"); logistics and railways
• Grant's strategy—attrition, continuous engagement, denial of
  recovery; victory through exhaustion rather than single battle
• Industrial and demographic superiority; river control (Mississippi,
  Vicksburg); Sherman's campaigns

The republic **scales** to total war; procedure (elections, civilian
command) holds while capacity expands.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. APPOMATTOX: PROCEDURAL TERMINATION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Surrender is framed as restoration, not annihilation.

Sequence:
• Lee's Army of Northern Virginia surrounded; surrender at Appomattox
  Court House (April 9, 1865)
• Grant's terms—parole, no imprisonment; officers retain sidearms;
  "The war is over; the rebels are our countrymen again"
• Legitimacy through **reintegration**; no revolutionary purge;
  procedure absorbs the defeated

Appomattox encodes **victory without regime reset**—the Union
wins by restoring authority and offering return to the fold, not
by erasing the defeated.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The American Civil War encodes **procedure preserved by force and
terminated by reintegration**.

Lessons:
• Union can be preserved by force when secession is denied
  legitimacy; procedure (Constitution, elections) continues.
• Deferred moral contradiction (slavery) resolves through war
  at catastrophic cost; emancipation as war measure and amendment.
• Civilian control holds—Lincoln and Grant; president sets
  policy, general executes.
• War termination can be procedural—surrender terms that preserve
  legitimacy and permit reintegration; Appomattox as precedent.
• Victory without revolutionary reset; Constitution amended, not
  replaced; the republic survives internal war.

The war is America's **union-preservation precedent**: secession
denied, procedure enforced, Appomattox as procedural end.

VII. MEM CONNECTIONS (MANDATORY)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
AMERICA:
• MEM–AMERICA–LINCOLN — Crisis presidency; union preservation;
  emancipation; legitimacy under stress; assassination.
• MEM–AMERICA–GRANT — Union commander; attrition and surrender;
  Appomattox terms; general who accepted civilian control; later
  president.
• MEM–AMERICA–WASHINGTON — Founding restraint; civilian control;
  Civil War reaffirms president over army; contrast: Washington
  voluntary exit, Lincoln death in office.
• MEM–AMERICA–JEFFERSON — Republican and territorial vision;
  slavery deferred at founding; Civil War as deferred reckoning.
• MEM–AMERICA–WAR–AMERICAN–INDEPENDENCE — Founding war (exit from
  empire); Civil War as inverse (deny exit from union); same
  procedural grammar, opposite pole.

Cross-Civilizational:
• MEM–ANGLIA–WAR–AMERICAN–CIVIL — Anglian encoding (internal
  stress test in American extension); same war, different
  civilizational frame.
• MEM–ANGLIA–WAR–AMERICAN–CIVIL–APPOMATTOX — Procedural
  termination; Grant's terms; surrender as governance decision.

Cross-references denote lineage, not equivalence.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VIII. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Union preserved by force; secession illegitimate; procedure
  survives total war.
• Emancipation as war measure; moral contradiction resolved
  through conflict at extreme cost.
• Appomattox: victory as reintegration; "countrymen again";
  procedural termination.
• Grant: attrition, civilian control, surrender terms—precedent
  for ending war without destroying the defeated.
• Civil War transforms America permanently; union indissoluble.

Tension preserved without verdict.
