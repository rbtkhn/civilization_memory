I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves the American Civil War as **America's union
preservation war**: the conflict in which the federal republic
denied secession, preserved constitutional continuity by force,
and resolved the slavery contradiction through war—emancipation,
attrition, and procedural termination at Appomattox (1865).

For America, the war is **procedure preserved at extreme cost**—
union indissoluble; secession illegitimate; victory as restoration,
not conquest.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. CONTEXT & TRIGGER: SECESSION VS. UNION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The war erupts from deferred contradictions and sovereignty dispute.

Context:
• Expansion and slavery; federal–state ambiguity embedded at founding
• Secession (1860–1861)—South Carolina and Confederacy assert
  lawful withdrawal; compact theory of union
• Union frame: **perpetual union**; secession as rebellion; war
  to restore authority and territory
• Lincoln: preserve the Union; elections continue; civilian control
  of military; procedure survives even at total-war scale

Both sides claim legality. The Union prevails by force and
legitimacy of federal authority.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. UNION WAR LOGIC & LEGITIMACY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Union fights to preserve process itself.

Characteristics:
• War under constitutional authority; Congress and president
• Elections (1864) during conflict—legitimacy renewed by ballot
• Civilian control of military; Lincoln and Grant relationship
• Emancipation (1863)—slavery reframed as legitimacy violation;
  war measure and moral alignment

Victory is defined as **continuity**—Constitution amended (Thirteenth),
not replaced; union authority affirmed as indissoluble.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. SCALE: INDUSTRIAL WAR & ATTRITION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The war transforms state capacity and military logic.

Elements:
• Mass mobilisation; continental distance; logistics and railways
• Grant's strategy—attrition, continuous engagement, denial of
  recovery; victory through exhaustion rather than single battle
• Industrial and demographic superiority; river control (Mississippi,
  Vicksburg); Sherman's campaigns

John Keegan, in *The American Civil War: A Military History* (2009),
emphasises geography and scale:

SOURCE — Keegan, *The American Civil War* (ARC-T-MODERN):
> "The principal problem confronting the Federal government in its
> effort to restore the union is that of distance."
> — John Keegan, *The American Civil War: A Military History* (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 2009) (ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-SECONDARY]. Quote as cited in Gallagher, *Washington Post*, 10 Jan 2010.

On the leading Union commanders Keegan writes:

SOURCE — Keegan, *The American Civil War* (ARC-T-MODERN):
> "Grant and William Tecumseh Sherman stood out among all commanders."
> — John Keegan, *The American Civil War: A Military History* (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 2009) (ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-SECONDARY]. Quote as cited in Gallagher, *Washington Post*, 10 Jan 2010.

Sherman's "brutal and decisive" approach to war-making left "the more
lasting" legacy; Grant's attrition and procedural surrender at
Appomattox complete the Union's restoration of authority.

The republic **scales** to total war; procedure (elections, civilian
command) holds while capacity expands.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. APPOMATTOX: PROCEDURAL TERMINATION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Surrender is framed as restoration, not annihilation.

Sequence:
• Lee's Army of Northern Virginia surrounded; surrender at Appomattox
  Court House (April 9, 1865)
• Grant's terms—parole, no imprisonment; officers retain sidearms;
  "The war is over; the rebels are our countrymen again"
• Legitimacy through **reintegration**; no revolutionary purge;
  procedure absorbs the defeated

Appomattox encodes **victory without regime reset**—the Union
wins by restoring authority and offering return to the fold, not
by erasing the defeated.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The American Civil War encodes **procedure preserved by force and
terminated by reintegration**.

Lessons:
• Union can be preserved by force when secession is denied
  legitimacy; procedure (Constitution, elections) continues.
• Deferred moral contradiction (slavery) resolves through war
  at catastrophic cost; emancipation as war measure and amendment.
• Civilian control holds—Lincoln and Grant; president sets
  policy, general executes.
• War termination can be procedural—surrender terms that preserve
  legitimacy and permit reintegration; Appomattox as precedent.
• Victory without revolutionary reset; Constitution amended, not
  replaced; the republic survives internal war.

The war is America's **union-preservation precedent**: secession
denied, procedure enforced, Appomattox as procedural end.
