I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves the **American Revolution** as America's founding
political rupture: the sequence in which thirteen colonies coordinated
resistance, declared independence, fought a war, and secured
recognition—**who had jurisdiction** to act, **who was on the hook**
for rebellion, and how **institutional survival** of the new polity
was achieved.

From a liability perspective: the Revolution has no single sovereign
until the Declaration—the Continental Congress is a **voluntary
assembly** of colonies, not a government. **Who bore the cost** of
defection from Britain? The delegates (treason if Britain won), the
colonies that sent them, and the soldiers and civilians who committed.
**Defection incentive** cut both ways: colonies could withhold delegates
or support; loyalists defected to the Crown. **Institutional survival**
depends on Congress holding, the Declaration making the break public
and irrevocable, and the war being won so that the new jurisdiction
sticks.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. SEQUENCE — CONGRESS, DECLARATION, WAR, TREATY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
**1774:** First Continental Congress—response to Coercive Acts;
grievance and coordination; no claim to sovereignty; petition and
boycott. **1775:** Lexington and Concord; Second Continental Congress;
Washington appointed commander; war underway while Congress still
petitions (Olive Branch). **1776:** Declaration of Independence—
rupture declared; Congress becomes the de facto authority for the
"United States." **1775–1783:** War of American Independence; French
alliance (1778); Yorktown (1781); Treaty of Paris (1783). **Jurisdiction**
shifts from Crown to Congress and then to the states under the Articles
(1781)—no single executive; Congress remains the coordinating body
until the Constitution replaces it.

Paine, in *Common Sense* (Philadelphia, Feb. 1776), framed the rupture
as universal and lowered the moral cost of defection from Britain:

SOURCE — Paine, *Common Sense* (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD):
> "The cause of America is in a great measure the cause of all mankind. Many circumstances hath, and will arise, which are not local, but universal, and through which the principles of all Lovers of Mankind are affected, and in the Event of which, their Affections are interested."
> — Thomas Paine, *Common Sense* (Philadelphia: W. & T. Bradford, 14 Feb. 1776); standard ed. (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD) [ERC-PRIMARY].

In Parliament (22 March 1775), Edmund Burke had urged conciliation and
governing by circumstance rather than abstract right—a procedural
alternative that Parliament did not adopt:

SOURCE — Burke, Speech on Conciliation with the Colonies (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD):
> "We must govern America according to that nature and to those circumstances, and not according to our own imaginations, nor according to abstract ideas of right—by no means according to mere general theories of government, the resort to which appears to me, in our present situation, no better than arrant trifling."
> — Edmund Burke, Speech on Moving His Resolutions for Conciliation with the Colonies, House of Commons, 22 March 1775; *The Works of the Right Honourable Edmund Burke*, 6 vols. (London: Henry G. Bohn, 1854–56), 1:464–71; also Wikisource, Project Gutenberg 5655 (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD) [ERC-PRIMARY].

III. LIABILITY ALLOCATION — WHO WAS ON THE HOOK
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
**Delegates:** Acted without formal mandate from a sovereign; they
claimed to speak for their colonies. Signing the Declaration exposed
them to **treason** if Britain prevailed—"we mutually pledge to each
other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor." **Colonies/states:**
Committed men and money; defection (e.g. New York occupation, loyalist
strongholds) was possible and occurred. **Washington and the Army:**
Personal exposure—defeat would mean trial or flight; victory would
legitimize the Congress that had appointed him. **Institutional
survival** of the Revolution required that the **cost of British
victory** be credibly higher than the cost of continued resistance—alliance,
endurance, and eventual victory made the Declaration's jurisdiction
stick.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. DEFECTION AND COORDINATION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
**Defection toward Britain:** Loyalists; colonies or regions that
hesitated; British occupation of New York, Philadelphia, Charleston.
**Defection from Congress:** No colony formally withdrew from the
Second Congress after the Declaration; the **pledge** and the war
bound them. **Coordination mechanism:** Congress had no power to
tax or compel; it requested men and money from the states. **Who
enforced?** Moral and political commitment; Washington's authority
as commander; French support. The Revolution survives because
**enough** colonies and individuals stayed committed and because
Britain eventually quit.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Revolution encodes **rupture by coordination**: no king, no
prior sovereign of the "United States"; a Congress that invents
itself as the voice of the colonies and then declares them independent;
a war that secures what the Declaration asserted. **Liability** is
distributed—delegates, soldiers, states, allies—and **irreversibility**
is achieved only when the Treaty of Paris recognizes the United States.
The Revolution is the **mechanism** by which American jurisdiction
is created; it does not assume that jurisdiction in advance. A
half-century later, Tocqueville described the compound republic
that this rupture had secured:

SOURCE — Tocqueville, *Democracy in America*, Vol. I (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD):
> "The sovereignty of the Union is an abstract thing which is connected with but few external objects. The sovereignty of the States is perceived by the senses, is understood without effort; every day it produces results which fall under every eye."
> — Alexis de Tocqueville, *Democracy in America*, Vol. I (1835), ed. Mansfield and Winthrop (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2000) or equivalent (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD) [ERC-PRIMARY].

VI. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Revolution = Congress + Declaration + War + Treaty; no single sovereign until Declaration.
• Congress was voluntary assembly; liability (treason, commitment) fell on delegates and colonies.
• Declaration made the break public and irrevocable; signers pledged lives, fortunes, honor.
• Defection (loyalists, occupation) and coordination (alliance, endurance) shaped outcome.
• Institutional survival required victory; Treaty of Paris fixed jurisdiction.

Tension preserved without verdict.
