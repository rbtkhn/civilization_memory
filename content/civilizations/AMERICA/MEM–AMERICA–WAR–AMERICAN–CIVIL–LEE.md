I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves Robert E. Lee as **the Confederacy's principal
field commander and the figure of procedural surrender**: commander
of the Army of Northern Virginia (1862–1865), architect of its
offensive and defensive campaigns, and the officer who chose
surrender at Appomattox—accepting defeat and Grant's terms rather
than protracted irregular war or flight.

Lee does not define Confederate legitimacy.
He **bears its military expression and its termination**.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. ROLE & ORIGIN
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Lee embodies Confederate military capacity and its limits.

Context:
• Virginia; West Point; Mexican–American War; Superintendent West
  Point; offered Union command April 1861; sides with Virginia and
  Confederacy
• Advisor to Davis; then field command—Seven Days (1862), Second
  Bull Run, Antietam, Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville, Gettysburg;
  thereafter defensive until Appomattox
• **Appomattox Court House (April 9, 1865)** — Army surrounded;
  surrender to Grant; parole and return home; Farewell to the Army
  of Northern Virginia (April 10)

John Keegan, in *The American Civil War: A Military History* (2009),
assesses Lee (as summarised in Gallagher, *Washington Post*, 10 Jan
2010): "undoubtedly a very great soldier" but "a great gentleman and
an indulgent colleague" who **failed to control subordinates**—tactical
brilliance and personal authority without the institutional grip that
might have averted costly disobedience (e.g. Gettysburg).

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA: CAMPAIGNS & SURRENDER
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Lee's campaigns encode offensive ambition and eventual exhaustion.

Elements:
• **Seven Days (1862)** — Drive McClellan from Richmond; costly;
  establishes Lee as premier Confederate commander
• **Second Bull Run, Antietam, Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville** —
  Victories or stalemates; Jackson's death (May 1863) removes his
  principal strike commander
• **Gettysburg (July 1863)** — Invasion of Pennsylvania; defeat;
  Keegan's critique: failure to control subordinates; high-water
  mark of Confederate offensive
• **1864–1865** — Grant's attrition; Petersburg; retreat; Appomattox
• **Surrender** — Acceptance of Grant's terms; parole; "countrymen
  again"; Farewell Address frames defeat as honourable lay-down of
  arms, not moral collapse

Lee's choice to surrender **preserves procedural termination**—the
Union gets submission without extermination; the South gets
reintegration possibility.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Lee encodes **Confederate military peak and procedural defeat**—great
soldier, indulgent commander, and the man who ended the war by
accepting terms.

Lessons:
• Confederate capacity for operational brilliance (Lee, Jackson) and
  structural limits: subordinate control, replacement depth, material
  exhaustion.
• Surrender as governance choice: Lee's acceptance of Grant's terms
  enables Appomattox as procedural end—no guerrilla myth, no
  endless insurgency.
• Memory split: American (Union) memory = defeat of rebellion and
  restoration; Southern memory = Lost Cause and Lee as noble
  figure—tension preserved in civilizational encoding.

V. MEM CONNECTIONS (MANDATORY)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
AMERICA:
• MEM–AMERICA–WAR–AMERICAN–CIVIL — Parent war; Army of Northern
  Virginia; Appomattox; procedural termination.
• MEM–AMERICA–WAR–AMERICAN–CIVIL–STONEWALL–JACKSON — Principal
  subordinate; Jackson's death weakens Lee; Gettysburg without
  Jackson.
• MEM–AMERICA–GRANT — Opponent; Grant's attrition and surrender
  terms; Lee's acceptance completes procedural end.
• MEM–AMERICA–LINCOLN — Opponent political authority; union
  preservation; Lee's surrender affirms federal authority.

Cross-Civilizational:
• MEM–ANGLIA–WAR–AMERICAN–CIVIL–APPOMATTOX — Procedural termination;
  Grant's terms; Lee's surrender and Farewell; "countrymen again."
• MEM–ANGLIA–WAR–AMERICAN–CIVIL–GETTYSBURG — Lee's invasion;
  turning point; Keegan on Lee's failure to control subordinates.

Cross-references denote lineage, not equivalence.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Lee: great soldier, indulgent colleague; failed to control
  subordinates (Keegan); Appomattox as procedural choice.
• Army of Northern Virginia: peak at Chancellorsville; Gettysburg
  and attrition; surrender preserves legitimacy of termination.
• Confederate memory: Lee as noble loser; Union memory: defeat of
  rebellion; both encoded in American civilizational grammar.

Tension preserved without verdict.
