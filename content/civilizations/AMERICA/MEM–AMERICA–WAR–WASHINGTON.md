I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves **George Washington as war figure**: his military
formation, his command of the Continental Army (1775–1783), and the
strategic and civilizational logic of his leadership—restraint, force
preservation, deference to civilian authority, and voluntary surrender
of command. It is distinct from MEM–AMERICA–PRESIDENT–WASHINGTON
(political and founding figure) and from MEM–AMERICA–WAR–AMERICAN–
INDEPENDENCE–WASHINGTON (his role within that war specifically); here
the focus is **Washington the soldier** across his martial career.

It seems to me that the crucial point is that Washington did not win
the War of Independence by winning battles. He lost more engagements
than he won; he made strategic errors. The question, really, is how
the army survived—how it was kept in the field, supplied (barely),
and subordinated to Congress so that victory at Yorktown could be
converted into diplomatic recognition. One has to understand that
his military prowess cannot be judged by the usual scorecard of
battles won and lost; his fortitude in keeping the Continental Army
intact was the historic accomplishment. Institutional continuity
appears in the transmission of a norm: the commander serves civilian
authority and, when the war is done, returns power.

The fact is that the structural picture was asymmetric: the colonies
could not defeat Britain in a set-piece European war. The name of the
game was survival, alliance (France), and the preservation of force
until British will collapsed. Washington's incentive structure was to
avoid annihilation, maintain Congress's trust, and deliver the army
to the moment when French intervention could produce a decisive node—
Yorktown.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

II. MILITARY FORMATION & SEVEN YEARS' WAR
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Washington's martial career begins in the Virginia Regiment during
the French and Indian War (Seven Years' War).

Context:
• Commission; Ohio Valley; Fort Necessity (1754)—surrender and
  inexperience; Braddock's defeat (1755); service under British
  command
• Lessons: frontier warfare, logistics, the limits of regular
  tactics in American terrain; exposure to imperial authority and
  colonial resentment of British officers' precedence

Churchill, in *A History of the English-Speaking Peoples*, Vol. 3,
notes Washington's early formation:

SOURCE — Churchill, *The Age of Revolution* (Vol. 3) (ARC-T-MODERN):
> "In this campaign a young Virginian officer named George Washington learnt his first military lessons."
> — Winston S. Churchill, *A History of the English-Speaking Peoples*, Vol. 3, *The Age of Revolution* (1956–1958), p. 118 (ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-SECONDARY].

That formation—colonial officer, imperial war, American space—prepares
him for the later role: commanding a continental force in a war of
endurance against the same power.

III. CONTINENTAL COMMAND: RESTRAINT & ENDURANCE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Appointed commander-in-chief (June 1775), Washington holds the army
together for eight years.

Trajectory:
• Boston (1775–1776)—siege; British evacuation
• New York (1776)—defeat; retreat; preservation of force
• Trenton and Princeton (1776–1777)—counter-strikes that restore
  morale and legitimacy of the cause
• Valley Forge (1777–1778)—institutionalisation of training and
  discipline; French alliance announced
• Monmouth (1778)—tactical stalemate; army holds
• Yorktown (1781)—combined Franco-American siege; Cornwallis
  surrenders; Washington and Rochambeau; French fleet blocks relief

Chernow, in *Washington: A Life* (2010), frames the logic:

SOURCE — Chernow, *Washington: A Life* (ARC-T-MODERN):
> "His military triumphs had been neither frequent nor epic in scale. He had lost more battles than he had won, had botched several through strategic blunders, and had won at Yorktown only with the indispensable aid of the French Army and fleet. But he was a different kind of general fighting a different kind of war, and his military prowess cannot be judged by the usual scorecard of battles won and lost. His fortitude in keeping the impoverished Continental Army intact was a major historic accomplishment."
> — Ron Chernow, *Washington: A Life* (New York: Penguin, 2010) (ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-SECONDARY].

Characteristics of command: avoidance of decisive annihilation
battles where the army might be destroyed; preservation of force
over glory; deference to Congress; legitimacy of command derived
from consent and endurance. Victory is achieved by survival and
alliance, not by domination of the enemy in the field.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. SURRENDER OF COMMAND
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Washington's defining martial act is **relinquishment**. In December
1783 he resigned his commission to Congress at Annapolis—no coup,
no military junta, no king. Jefferson later described his singular
destiny: leading the armies through an arduous war, conducting
councils through the birth of government, and "scrupulously obeying
the laws through the whole of his career, civil and military, of
which the history of the world furnishes no other example." The
transmission of Anglian norm is complete: procedure over person;
the general returns power to the civilian sovereign.
