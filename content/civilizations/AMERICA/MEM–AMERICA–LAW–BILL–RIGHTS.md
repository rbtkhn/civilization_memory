I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves the **Bill of Rights** (Amendments I–X to the
U.S. Constitution, ratified 1791) as America's **negative jurisdictional
boundary**: the text that says what the federal government **may not**
do, and what procedures it must follow when it acts against persons.

From a liability perspective: the Bill of Rights **reduces exposure**
of the citizen to federal power. It does not grant rights that
would not exist; it **binds the sovereign**—Congress may not make
laws abridging speech; the accused gets a jury, counsel, confrontation.
Who is on the hook when the government overreaches? The government;
the individual may invoke the text to resist.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. ORIGIN — RATIFICATION BARGAIN
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Constitution drafted 1787; ratification contested. Anti-Federalists
feared concentrated federal power. **Defection incentive**: states
and factions that agreed to the new frame demanded a written limit
on what the centre could do. The Bill of Rights was the price of
ratification—not a gift from above but a **constraint extracted**
by those who would otherwise have withheld assent.

Madison shepherded the amendments in the First Congress. Structural
logic: enumerate limits so that future majorities cannot claim
unbounded jurisdiction by silence.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. FIRST AMENDMENT — SPEECH, PRESS, ASSEMBLY, PETITION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion,
or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom
of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to
assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances."

**Jurisdiction denied**: Congress has no compulsory authority in
these domains. The individual is not liable to federal suppression
for speech, worship, or assembly (within the evolving limits the
Court has drawn). **Institutional survival** of dissent and press
is textually entrenched; reversal requires amendment.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. CRIMINAL PROCESS — FOURTH, FIFTH, SIXTH, EIGHTH
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Fourth: unreasonable searches and seizures; warrants. Fifth: grand
jury, double jeopardy, self-incrimination, due process, takings.
Sixth: speedy trial, jury, confrontation, counsel. Eighth: no
excessive bail, fines, or cruel and unusual punishment.

**Liability mechanism**: the state must follow procedure before
it may punish. The accused has procedural shields. Who bears the
cost of violation? The prosecution; evidence may be excluded,
convictions overturned. **Personal liability** of the accused is
conditioned on the state's compliance with the process the Bill
of Rights demands.

SOURCE — U.S. Constitution, Amendment V (1791) (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD):
> "No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the Militia, when in actual service in time of War or public danger; nor shall any person be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation."
> — U.S. Constitution, Amendments I–X (Bill of Rights), 1791 (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD) [ERC-PRIMARY].

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. NINTH AND TENTH — RESIDUAL RIGHTS AND RESERVED POWERS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Ninth: enumeration of certain rights shall not be construed to deny
or disparage others retained by the people. Tenth: powers not
delegated to the United States nor prohibited to the states are
reserved to the states or the people.

**Jurisdiction ceiling**: the federal government has only delegated
powers; the list of rights is not exhaustive. **Defection incentive**
for the states: they retain everything not given away. The Bill
of Rights thus reinforces federalism—dual sovereignty and limited
federal reach.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Bill of Rights encodes **restraint on the centre**. It answers:
what may the federal government not do, and what must it do when
it acts against persons? Anglian procedural suspicion—Magna Carta,
petition of right, habeas—is translated into a written American
limit. **Institutional survival** of the limits depends on courts
and political culture enforcing them; the text alone does not
enforce itself. But the text assigns the burden: the government
must justify; the individual may resist by invoking the amendments.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Bill of Rights binds the sovereign; reduces citizen exposure to federal power.
• First Amendment denies Congress jurisdiction over speech, press, religion, assembly.
• Criminal-process amendments condition state punishment on procedure.
• Ninth and Tenth reserve unenumerated rights and state powers.
• Reversal of these limits requires amendment; entrenchment is high.

Tension preserved without verdict.
