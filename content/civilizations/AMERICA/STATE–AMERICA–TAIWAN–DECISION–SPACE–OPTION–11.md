## Option 11 (and variants): One-China return, halt arms, peace with China

**Core idea:** Reaffirm the one-China policy in a form Beijing accepts; stop or phase out arms sales to Taiwan; prioritize diplomatic and economic normalization with the PRC (“making peace with China”) even at the cost of current levels of support for Taiwan’s defense and political status.

This is a **material option** that the duty of competence requires surfacing. It sits at the accommodative end of the decision space. Presenting it is not an endorsement.

### Option 11A: Full return — reaffirm one-China, halt arms, seek détente

**Action:**
- **Reaffirm** the one-China framework in terms Beijing has long requested: e.g. explicit or strongly implied acceptance that Taiwan is part of China; no official treatment of Taiwan as a sovereign state; no high-level official visits that imply state-to-state relations.
- **Halt** new arms sales notifications and new Foreign Military Sales to Taiwan; **freeze** or **phase out** delivery of the existing backlog (e.g. no new drawdowns; allow existing LOAs to lapse or be renegotiated downward).
- **Pursue peace with China:** prioritize summit diplomacy, trade and investment stability, and de-escalation in the Taiwan Strait and the Pacific; accept PRC “core interest” framing on Taiwan in exchange for reduced tension, market access, or other U.S. goals.

**Rationale (as proponents might argue):** Avoids war over Taiwan; reduces escalation risk; unlocks economic and diplomatic gains with the world’s second-largest economy; aligns with a strict reading of historic U.S. communiqués (Shanghai, normalization) and the idea that the U.S. “does not support Taiwan independence.” Frees resources and political capital for other priorities (Doctrine 04 — time; resource allocation).

**Risks and costs:**
- **Doctrine 06 (dual-ocean denial):** Pacific assurance to Taiwan and to allies (Japan, Australia, others) is reduced or removed. Allies may conclude the U.S. will not uphold commitments under pressure; denial of PRC coercion in the first island chain is weakened.
- **Doctrine 05 (coalition primacy):** Allies who relied on U.S. commitment to Taiwan and to a “free and open Indo-Pacific” may defect, hedge, or bandwagon with Beijing. Legitimacy of U.S. alliance guarantees is damaged.
- **Taiwan:** Taipei would face a sharp drop in military capability and political support; vulnerability to coercion or force increases. The “silicon shield” and economic leverage do not substitute for credible deterrence if the U.S. is seen as withdrawn.
- **Domestic and precedent:** Bipartisan consensus has long supported Taiwan’s capacity to defend itself; a full halt would trigger major political and legislative pushback. Reversibility is low: once arms are stopped and one-China is reaffirmed in a way Beijing can cite, restoring the prior posture is difficult.
- **Narrative (Doctrine 07):** The story that the U.S. stands by allies and opposes coercion would be contradicted by policy; narrative–procedure gap would be large.

**Discriminating evidence:**
- Beijing’s response: does it reduce pressure on Taiwan and offer tangible concessions (trade, rhetoric, military posture), or does it treat the move as vindication and press for more?
- Ally reaction: do Japan, Australia, and others publicly support the shift, acquiesce quietly, or condemn it and distance from the U.S.?
- Taiwan: political and military adaptation; whether it seeks other partners or accommodates Beijing.

**Dimension mix:** Arms: stop. Chips: could remain (economic) or be subordinated to PRC preferences. Coalition: unilateral U.S. shift; allies not necessarily consulted in advance. Signal to Beijing: accommodative.

### Option 11B: Phased return with conditions (“negotiated peace”)

**Action:**
- **Reaffirm** one-China in clearer language than current policy, but **tie** any reduction in arms and any “peace” steps to **reciprocal PRC behavior**: e.g. no use of force, no blockade, no formal annexation; sustained dialogue with Taipei; no escalation of military pressure. “We return to one-China and scale arms if and only if China keeps the peace.”
- **Phase** arms: e.g. no new major systems; clear backlog over a multiyear period at a reduced pace; or cap at a defined level. Do not promise to stop entirely unless Beijing meets specified conditions.
- **Frame** as “peace with China” through **negotiated understanding** rather than unilateral U.S. concession: seek a tacit or explicit modus vivendi (no force, no formal independence, no U.S. recognition of Taiwan as state) in exchange for U.S. restraint on arms and rhetoric.

**Rationale (as proponents might argue):** Reduces risk of war and gives Beijing an incentive to avoid force; preserves some U.S. leverage (arms can be slowed or reversed if China cheats); process (Doctrine 01) is preserved by making the move conditional and potentially reversible.

**Risks and costs:**
- Beijing may not accept conditions or may pocket concessions and press for more. “Negotiated peace” can become one-sided if the U.S. gives first and China does not reciprocate.
- Taiwan and allies may still see any phased reduction as the start of abandonment; assurance erodes. Doctrine 05 and 06 are still stressed, though less than under 11A.
- Domestic and legislative opposition remains; conditions may be hard to enforce or verify.

**Discriminating evidence:**
- Whether Beijing agrees to verifiable or observable restraints (e.g. no new base construction opposite Taiwan, no blockade exercises).
- Whether arms phase is truly conditional (e.g. pause reversible if PRC escalates) or becomes a one-way ramp down.

**Dimension mix:** Arms: phase / condition on PRC. Chips: negotiable. Coalition: could consult allies before committing. Signal: accommodative but conditional.

### Option 11C: Rhetorical return only — no arms change

**Action:**
- **Tighten** public rhetoric to **reaffirm** one-China (e.g. “we do not support Taiwan independence”; “we acknowledge the Chinese position on one-China”) **without** changing arms sales, backlog, or TRA implementation.
- **Seek** better dialogue and crisis communication with Beijing; avoid provocative statements or visits. **Do not** halt or phase arms.

**Rationale:** “Making peace” in tone and diplomacy while preserving Taiwan’s defense support. Reduces rhetorical friction with Beijing; may create space for trade or other deals. Doctrine 06 is preserved in practice; 05 is less stressed if allies are reassured that arms continue.

**Risks:** Beijing may treat rhetoric as insufficient and demand policy change. Taiwan and allies may still worry that rhetoric is the first step toward 11A or 11B. Domestic critics may say the U.S. is “apologizing” to China.

**Dimension mix:** Arms: hold. Chips: no change. Coalition: no change. Signal: accommodative (rhetoric only).

## Summary: Option 11 in the decision space

| Variant | One-China | Arms | Peace with China | Doctrine impact |
|--------|-----------|------|-------------------|------------------|
| **11A** | Full return (Beijing’s framing) | Halt; phase out backlog | Prioritize détente; accept “core interest” | 06, 05 heavily stressed; 04 (resource shift) |
| **11B** | Reaffirm + conditions | Phase; condition on PRC behavior | Negotiated modus vivendi | 06, 05 stressed; 01 (process) if conditions hold |
| **11C** | Rhetorical reaffirm only | No change | Tone and dialogue | 06, 05 largely intact; 07 (narrative) tension |

## Doctrine and Presidential Brief check

- **Doctrine 06 (both oceans):** 11A and 11B reduce or condition Pacific denial and assurance; 11C does not.
- **Doctrine 05 (coalition):** 11A and 11B risk ally defection and loss of legitimacy; 11C less so.
- **Doctrine 03 (exit with process):** If the U.S. frames 11A or 11B as “strategic choice” and “reprioritization,” exit can be procedurally managed; if allies and Taiwan frame it as “abandonment,” legitimacy is damaged.
- **Presidential Brief — “Both oceans matter”:** 11A and 11B conflict with “don’t trade one theater away”; 11C is consistent if arms and posture hold.
- **Presidential Brief — “Coalitions carry legitimacy”:** 11A/11B without prior ally consultation stress “don’t surprise them on big moves.”
