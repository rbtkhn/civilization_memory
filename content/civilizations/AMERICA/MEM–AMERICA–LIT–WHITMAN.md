I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves Walt Whitman as **America's poet of the
democratic self**: the author of *Leaves of Grass* who turned
the individual into a **cosmic and national** voice—"I celebrate
myself" as the republic speaking, body and soul, in one breath.
He encodes the union as multitudinous and the poet as its
mouthpiece; the Civil War and the wounded become his later
subject, binding poetry to the nation's trial.

Whitman does not draft policy.
He **voices** the republic—the worker, the soldier, the body,
the continent—in a form that bypasses Anglian poetic convention
and invents an American line. His influence is the democratic
"I" and the fusion of nation with self.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

II. SONG OF MYSELF: THE DEMOCRATIC "I"
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
"Song of Myself" (1855, rev. through 1882) opens with the
celebratory self that assumes the reader's identity—every atom
belonging to the poet as good belongs to you. The individual
is **universal**; the body is sacred; the nation is the poet's
body writ large.

SOURCE — Whitman, "Song of Myself" (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD):
> "I celebrate myself, and sing myself,
> And what I assume you shall assume,
> For every atom belonging to me as good belongs to you."
> — Walt Whitman, "Song of Myself," in *Leaves of Grass* (Brooklyn: 1855); standard ed. (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD) [ERC-PRIMARY].

Later in the poem: "Do I contradict myself? / Very well then I
contradict myself, / (I am large, I contain multitudes.)" The
**legitimacy** of the American experiment is cast as bodily and
inclusive—the poet contains the multitudes; the republic contains
them. This is Emersonian self-trust in **democratic** key: not
the solitary soul but the self as everyone.

III. CIVIL WAR AND DRUM-TAPS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Whitman's service in the hospitals (visiting wounded) and
*Drum-Taps* (1865) tie his voice to the Union cause and to
the cost of war. "When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd"
elegises Lincoln. The poet becomes **witness** to the nation's
suffering and to its persistence. Procedure (union, emancipation)
is not his domain; **memory and feeling** are—the war encoded
in verse for civilizational recall.

IV. CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Whitman encodes **the democratic self as national voice**: the
republic sung in the first person, body and multitudes. He
supplies the poetic grammar for American self-understanding—
inclusive, bodily, contradictory, large. Leaves of Grass and
the Civil War poems become **canonical** for the union's
imagination of itself.

Lessons:
• The "I" can stand for the nation; poetry can encode
  democratic identity and wartime sacrifice.
• Whitman breaks Anglian metre and decorum; American verse
  invents its own line.
• Influence on later American poetry and on the idea of
  the poet as public voice; Emerson welcomed Leaves of Grass.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Celebrate myself = celebrate the republic; atom and multitudes.
• Civil War and Lincoln elegised; poet as witness to union's cost.
• Emersonian inheritance; democratic and bodily turn.
• Tension with Puritan and guilt-ridden strands (Hawthorne, Poe)
  preserved—Whitman is affirmation; others are dark or critical.

Tension preserved without verdict.

VI. MEM CONNECTIONS (MANDATORY)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
AMERICA:
• MEM–AMERICA–LIT–EMERSON — Emerson praised Leaves of Grass;
  Whitman's democratic self as extension of self-reliance.
• MEM–AMERICA–LIT–THOREAU — Contemporary; Thoreau's solitary
  refusal vs. Whitman's inclusive celebration; both post-Emerson.
• MEM–AMERICA–LIT–HAWTHORNE — Contrast: Hawthorne's guilt and
  sin vs. Whitman's bodily affirmation.
• MEM–AMERICA–LIT–POE — Contrast: Poe's gothic, death-obsessed
  vs. Whitman's celebratory, life-embracing; different American voices.
• MEM–AMERICA–LIT–PAINE — Paine's "cause of all mankind";
  Whitman's "every atom... as good belongs to you"—universalising
  the American.
• MEM–AMERICA–WAR–AMERICAN–CIVIL — Drum-Taps; hospital visits;
  Lincoln elegy; war encoded in verse.
• MEM–AMERICA–PRESIDENT–LINCOLN — "When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd";
  Lincoln's death as national trauma in poetry.
• MEM–AMERICA–PRESIDENT–JACKSON — Era of Whitman's youth; democratic
  expansion and the "common man" as context for the democratic "I."
