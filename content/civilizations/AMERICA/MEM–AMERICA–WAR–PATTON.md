I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves **George S. Patton as war figure**: his command
of American armored forces in the Mediterranean and European
theatres—North Africa, Sicily, the Normandy breakout (Third Army),
the Bulge (relief of Bastogne), and the drive into Germany. Patton
was a **field commander**: speed, shock, and offensive action;
subordinate to Eisenhower (and at times Bradley); controversial
for the slapping incidents (Sicily 1943) and for rhetoric that
sometimes exceeded policy. He did not set grand strategy; he
**executed** it at the tip of the spear.

It seems to me that the crucial point is that Patton embodied
**offensive armored warfare**—the general who believed in attack,
mobility, and the moral effect of relentless advance. The question,
really, is how his drive (Third Army's race across France after
Cobra, the turn north to Bastogne in December 1944) served
Eisenhower's broad-front strategy and how his personality—flamboyant,
sometimes brutal—tested the limits of what a theatre commander would
tolerate. One has to understand that he was both **instrument** (the
commander who could break the line and exploit) and **liability**
(slapping soldiers, inflammatory remarks); Eisenhower kept him when
his usefulness outweighed his risk. Institutional continuity
appears in his subordination: he served Ike; when he stepped out of
line he was disciplined (Sicily); when he was needed (Bulge) he was
used.

The fact is that the structural picture was clear: the Allied advance
required commanders who would push hard and exploit breakthroughs.
Patton's incentive structure was to attack—to use armor and speed
to unhinge the enemy. The name of the game in Normandy was breakout
(Cobra, July 1944); Patton's Third Army executed the exploitation
across France. In the Bulge, the incentive was to relieve Bastogne
and restore the line; Patton turned his army north in days and did it.
His removal from command never came; his controversies were contained.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

II. NORTH AFRICA & SICILY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Patton entered the European war in North Africa (1942–1943).

Trajectory:
• **Torch (November 1942)** — Patton commanded Western Task Force;
  Morocco landings; then II Corps after Kasserine Pass (February
  1943)—restored discipline and led counteroffensive
• **Sicily (July–August 1943)** — Patton commanded Seventh Army;
  race to Messina with Montgomery's Eighth Army; Palermo, then
  east; **slapping incidents** (August)—Patton struck two
  soldiers he accused of malingering (combat fatigue); media and
  political outcry; Eisenhower reprimanded him; Patton apologized;
  kept in command but sidelined for Overlord initial phase
• **Legacy of Sicily** — Victory and controversy; Patton's aggression
  and his abuse of subordinates encoded the tension between
  operational effectiveness and institutional restraint

III. NORMANDY BREAKOUT & THIRD ARMY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Patton returned to operational command when Third Army was activated
in France (August 1944), under Bradley's 12th Army Group.

Sequence:
• **Operation Cobra (July 1944)** — Breakout from Normandy;
  Patton not in direct command of Cobra but Third Army (activated
  August 1) exploited the breach
• **Race across France** — Third Army drove south and east;
  Brittany, then east toward Paris and the Seine; speed and
  logistics; "advance and exploit"
• **Supply constraints** — Eisenhower's broad-front strategy
  spread fuel and ammunition; Patton's drive halted at the
  Moselle (September) for want of supply; debate over narrow
  thrust vs broad front
• **Lorraine and the Saar** — Fall 1944; hard fighting; Metz;
  Third Army regrouped for the Bulge

Patton's operational signature: **mobility and aggression**. When
the line broke, he pushed; when supply ran out, he stopped. His
relationship with Eisenhower and Bradley was one of subordinate
who pushed for more—more fuel, more priority—and sometimes
received it, sometimes not.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. BULGE & GERMANY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The German Ardennes offensive (December 1944) broke the Allied
line; Bastogne was encircled. Eisenhower needed a counterstroke.

• **Relief of Bastogne** — Patton was ordered to turn Third Army
  north; in days he reoriented his forces and attacked into the
  Bulge; Bastogne relieved (26 December); the offensive blunted
• **Drive into Germany (1945)** — Third Army crossed the Rhine
  (March 1945); pushed into Bavaria and Czechoslovakia; war's
  end (May 1945)
• **Death (December 1945)** — Patton died after a traffic accident
  in Germany; buried in Luxembourg

Patton did not command the whole European theatre; he commanded
Third Army. His place in civilizational memory is the **aggressive
armored commander**—the general who could turn an army in winter
and break a siege, and who also slapped soldiers and spoke out of
turn. Eisenhower's management of Patton (use him, discipline him,
keep him) encodes the same norm as Marshall's and Truman's: **the
commander serves; when he exceeds, he is corrected**.

V. MEM CONNECTIONS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• MEM–AMERICA–PRESIDENT–EISENHOWER — DEPENDS_ON: Patton served
  under Eisenhower in Mediterranean and Europe; Ike chose when
  to use him and when to discipline him.
• MEM–AMERICA–WAR–MARSHALL — PARALLELS: Marshall built the army
  and chose Ike; Patton was a field instrument of that army.
• MEM–AMERICA–WAR–WASHINGTON — PARALLELS: Washington deferred
  to civilian authority; Patton was subordinate to Ike and
  corrected when he violated norms (slapping).
• MEM–AMERICA–WAR–MACARTHUR — PARALLELS: Both aggressive theatre
  or army commanders; MacArthur challenged policy and was relieved;
  Patton stayed within chain of command and was contained.
• MEM–AMERICA–WAR–ARMY — ENABLES: Patton commanded armored forces;
  Third Army as instrument of land warfare.
• MEM–AMERICA–WAR–AMERICAN–CIVIL–SHERMAN — PARALLELS: Deep strike,
  mobility, moral effect; different war, similar operational
  aggression.
