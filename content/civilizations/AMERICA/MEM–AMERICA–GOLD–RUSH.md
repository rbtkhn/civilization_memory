I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves the **California Gold Rush** as the event
that triggered the largest migration in American history and
established the demand basin for the Far West—the same region
that would later depend on the Colorado River for water and on
transcontinental rail for connection to the East. James W.
Marshall's discovery at Sutter's Mill (January 1848), in
territory just acquired from Mexico by the Treaty of Guadalupe
Hidalgo, set off a scramble by hundreds of thousands via Cape
Horn, Panama, and overland routes.

The Gold Rush does not create American expansion; it **accelerates**
it. Legitimacy of settlement in California and the Southwest
rests on the migration that followed—and that migration created
a population that could not be sustained without imported water
and infrastructure.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

II. DISCOVERY, ROUTES, AND MIGRATION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Gold was found in the Sierra Nevada foothills in January 1848;
news reached the East and the world in 1849. "Forty-Niners"
flooded in by ship (Pacific, Cape Horn, Isthmus of Panama) and
overland (across the continent). San Francisco and Sacramento
exploded; mining camps and violence followed. The rush peaked
in the early 1850s; placer mining gave way to corporate and
hydraulic extraction; California entered the Union in 1850.

H.W. Brands (*The Age of Gold* [2002]) centres the Rush as the
trigger for massive settlement of the Far West:

SOURCE — Brands, *The Age of Gold* (ARC-T-MODERN):
> "The gold discovery triggered the largest migration in American history; hundreds of thousands scrambled to California by every route imaginable—across the Pacific, around Cape Horn, through the Isthmus of Panama, and across America's unsettled wilderness."
> — H.W. Brands, *The Age of Gold: The California Gold Rush and the New American Dream* (2002) (ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-SECONDARY]

That migration established the **demand basin** that the Colorado
River would later be asked to supply and that transcontinental
rail would later bind to the East. The Rush thus encodes
**pursuit of opportunity** (Brands' "Dreams of El Dorado" theme)
and **structural consequence**: settlement ahead of water and
infrastructure, then procedure (allocation, rail) following.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. LEGITIMACY AND STRUCTURAL CONSEQUENCE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
California and the Southwest were acquired by war and treaty
(Mexican–American War, Guadalupe Hidalgo 1848); the Gold Rush
populated the new territory at a pace that made it **Anglian**
in fact—courts, land claims, and eventually statehood. The
legitimacy of that settlement rested on migration and labor;
the **cost** was dependence on water (Colorado, later) and
connection (rail, later). The river and the railroad did not
cause the Rush; they became necessary because of it.

**Structurally**, the Rush is an **incentive shock**: discovery
creates migration; migration creates demand for infrastructure
and allocation. Procedure (statehood, water compacts, rail
charters) follows the fact of settlement. The same pattern
appears in *Dreams of El Dorado*—the headlong pursuit of
opportunity, then irony and paradox (dreams blowing up, or
requiring collective largesse to sustain).

V. CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Gold Rush encodes **migration as driver of settlement** and
**demand before allocation**.

Lessons:
• A discovery (gold) can trigger migration on a scale that
  defines a region; legitimacy of settlement follows the fact
  of presence and labor.
• The same migration creates **structural dependence**—water
  (Colorado) and rail (transcontinental) become necessary;
  procedure (compacts, charters) follows.
• The Rush is the central node linking Manifest Destiny
  (expansion), Mexican Cession (territory), Colorado River
  (water allocation), and transcontinental rail (connection).

VI. MEM CONNECTIONS (TYPED)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

DEPENDS_ON:
• MEM–AMERICA–WAR–MEXICAN–AMERICAN — California and Southwest acquired by treaty (Guadalupe Hidalgo 1848) before Rush peaked.
• MEM–AMERICA–MANIFEST–DESTINY — Expansion ideology; Rush as fulfilment of westward movement.
• MEM–AMERICA–GEO–ROCKIES — Overland routes; migration crossed continent.

ENABLES:
• MEM–AMERICA–GEO–COLORADO–RIVER — Migration created demand basin that Colorado River supplies; allocation legitimacy.
• MEM–AMERICA–TRANSCONTINENTAL–RAILROAD — California and West linked to East; Rush preceded rail, rail served post-Rush settlement.
• MEM–AMERICA–GILDED–AGE — Risk culture, extraction, and scale; Rush as early episode of capitalist expansion.

GEOGRAPHIC:
• MEM–AMERICA–GEO–COLORADO–RIVER — Demand basin for water; settlement that cannot support itself without imported water.
• MEM–AMERICA–GEO–ROCKIES — Migration routes; overland Forty-Niners.

TEMPORAL_BEFORE:
• MEM–AMERICA–MANIFEST–DESTINY — Ideology preceded; Rush operationalised expansion in California.
TEMPORAL_AFTER:
• MEM–AMERICA–TRANSCONTINENTAL–RAILROAD — Rail completed 1869; linked Gold Rush–era California to East.
• MEM–AMERICA–GILDED–AGE — Capital concentration and procedure; Rush as antecedent.

PARALLELS:
• (Cross-civ: resource discovery triggering migration and settlement; rush dynamics elsewhere.)

Cross-references denote lineage, not equivalence.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Gold Rush = largest migration in American history (Brands); demand basin for Colorado and rail.
• Settlement before infrastructure; procedure (water, rail) follows.
• El Dorado theme: pursuit of opportunity; irony (dreams blow up or require collective largesse).

Tension preserved without verdict.
