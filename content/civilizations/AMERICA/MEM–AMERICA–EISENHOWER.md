I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves Dwight D. Eisenhower as **America's coalition
general and institutional steward**: the Supreme Allied Commander
who led the Normandy invasion and Western coalition to victory,
then as president (1953–1961) anchored Cold War containment, NATO,
and Atlantic primacy—and who restrained allies (Suez 1956), enforced
federal procedure (Little Rock), and warned against the
"military-industrial complex" in farewell.

Eisenhower does not rupture the republic.
He **embodies** it—military coalition leadership, then civilian
restraint; procedure and alliance over personal aggrandisement;
institutional legitimacy as general-then-president.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. ORIGIN & STYLE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Eisenhower rises through institutional military and coalition command.

Context:
• Supreme Allied Commander, European Theatre (1943–1945);
  D-Day (1944), Normandy, coalition coordination
• Legitimacy from execution and alliance management—not rhetoric;
  British–American–Canadian unity under his command
• President (1953–1961)—elected as elder statesman; "I like Ike";
  moderate Republican; two terms

Authority is framed as **institutional and coalitional**: the general
who could hold allies together, then the president who could hold
containment and procedure without dramatic rupture. Restraint and
continuity over vigour and innovation; contrast with successor
Kennedy's youth and New Frontier.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. COLD WAR: CONTAINMENT, NATO, MASSIVE RETALIATION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Eisenhower presides over consolidated Cold War structure.

Elements:
• NATO as binding commitment; U.S. as Atlantic guarantor;
  European security as extension of U.S. procedural order
• "Massive retaliation"—nuclear deterrence as declarative doctrine;
  cost and credibility as deterrent; escalation risk acknowledged
• Containment without rollback—perimeter held, not extended;
  Korea armistice (1953) under predecessor; no new major land war
  launched under Ike

Doctrine is **declarative and deterrent**: alliance (NATO) and
nuclear threat (massive retaliation) frame the perimeter. Procedure
(binding treaty, declared doctrine) substitutes for permanent
conventional deployment at full scale.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. SUEZ (1956): RESTRAINT OF ALLIES
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Eisenhower opposes British–French–Israeli action at Suez.

Sequence:
• Nasser nationalises Suez Canal; UK, France, Israel invade (1956)
• U.S. opposes—financial pressure (sterling, IMF); no support for
  allied intervention; Atlantic primacy over colonial restoration
• Allies withdraw; Suez encodes **U.S. as procedural arbiter**—
  even over closest allies when their action conflicts with
  declared order (sovereignty, non-use of force)
• Canal reverts to Egyptian control; Britain loses imperial node;
  U.S. does not replace Britain as canal sovereign—control without
  sovereignty remains the pattern (MEM–AMERICA–GEO–SUEZ–CANAL)

Eisenhower's choice: **alliance discipline and procedural norm**
over backing allies' fait accompli. The U.S. underwrites Atlantic
order by constraining, not joining, imperial reassertion.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. DOMESTIC: HIGHWAYS, LITTLE ROCK, FAREWELL WARNING
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Eisenhower expands infrastructure and enforces federal supremacy.

Elements:
• Interstate Highway System—federal investment; mobility and
  defence rationale; procedural expansion of state capacity
• Little Rock (1957)—federal enforcement of desegregation; troops
  secure compliance with court order; procedure (Constitution,
  courts) over local defiance
• "Military-industrial complex" (1961 farewell)—warning against
  capture of policy by arms industry and military; legitimacy
  and restraint as institutional caution; general-turned-president
  as critic of militarisation

The president **enforces** procedure (Little Rock) and **warns**
against procedure's distortion (complex). Institutional legitimacy
includes both obedience to law and scepticism toward concentrated
power.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Eisenhower encodes **coalition leadership, Atlantic primacy, and
institutional restraint**.

Lessons:
• General-then-president can reinforce procedure—Washington and
  Grant precedent; Eisenhower adds Cold War and alliance dimension;
  legitimacy from military execution then civilian restraint.
• Alliance discipline can mean restraining allies (Suez)—U.S.
  procedural order over imperial restoration; Atlantic primacy
  as norm enforcement.
• Declarative deterrence (massive retaliation, NATO) holds perimeter
  without permanent maximum mobilisation; procedure (treaty, doctrine)
  as substitute for constant force.
• Federal enforcement of court order (Little Rock) affirms procedure
  over local defiance; legitimacy through compliance with law.
• Farewell warning (military-industrial complex) encodes institutional
  caution—even the architect of victory and containment warns
  against institutional capture.

Eisenhower is America's **coalition steward and institutional
president**: D-Day and NATO, Suez restraint, Little Rock enforcement,
and the warning that outlives his tenure.

VII. MEM CONNECTIONS (MANDATORY)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
AMERICA:
• MEM–AMERICA–WASHINGTON — General-then-president; voluntary
  restraint; civilian supremacy; Eisenhower as twentieth-century
  parallel; institutional legitimacy over personal power.
• MEM–AMERICA–GRANT — General-then-president; Grant as Union
  executor; Eisenhower as coalition executor then president;
  contrast in scandal (Grant era) vs institutional caution (Ike).
• MEM–AMERICA–KENNEDY — Successor; contrast in style—Eisenhower
  elder, institutional; Kennedy youth, vigour, New Frontier;
  continuity of containment, change of tone.
• MEM–AMERICA–NIXON — Vice President under Eisenhower; Nixon's
  later realpolitik and rupture; Ike's restraint vs Nixon's
  extension and violation.
• MEM–AMERICA–MONROE — Hemisphere and Atlantic order; Eisenhower's
  NATO and Suez stance as Atlantic/ procedural primacy; no new
  European colonisation extended to restraining allies' imperial
  reassertion.
• MEM–AMERICA–JACKSON — Federal enforcement; Jackson's confrontation
  with states; Eisenhower's Little Rock—federal authority and
  procedure over local defiance (different substantive cause, same
  structural pattern).
• MEM–AMERICA–GEO–SUEZ–CANAL — Suez as chokepoint; Britain's loss
  (1956); Eisenhower's role in opposing allied intervention; U.S.
  does not seize canal—control without sovereignty.

Cross-references denote lineage, not equivalence.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VIII. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Coalition leadership (WWII, NATO) can translate into presidential
  legitimacy; procedure and alliance over personality.
• Restraining allies (Suez) can affirm procedural order; Atlantic
  primacy as norm, not only capability.
• General-then-president can warn against militarisation;
  institutional caution from inside the institution.
• Federal enforcement (Little Rock) affirms procedure; court order
  and troops as instruments of continuity.
• Eisenhower is Washington's heir in restraint and Grant's in
  military-to-civilian transition; Kennedy's contrast in vigour.

Tension preserved without verdict.
