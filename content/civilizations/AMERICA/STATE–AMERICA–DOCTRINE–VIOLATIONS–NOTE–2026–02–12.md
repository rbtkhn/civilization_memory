# Doctrine Violations — U.S. History (Session Note)

**Date:** 2026-02-12  
**Source:** SCHOLAR–AMERICA LEARN session (doctrine violations, surprising results)  
**Reference:** CIV–DOCTRINE–AMERICA 01–07

This note records examples where U.S. conduct **blatantly violated** American doctrine, and where violations had **surprising results** (corrective reassertion, managed exit, or repudiation). Non-authoritative; for session continuity and STATE/SCHOLAR linkage.

## Violations by doctrine

| Doctrine | Violation examples |
|----------|--------------------|
| **01 Procedure** | Bay of Pigs (1961), Iran–Contra (1985–87), Watergate (1972–74) — authority in persons or covert action, not process |
| **02 Rupture absorption** | Japanese American internment (1942) — coercion and rights suspension, not institutional repurposing |
| **03 Defeat without collapse** | Cases where defeat was *not* procedurally managed (chaotic or illegitimately framed exit) |
| **04 Time as weapon** | Iraq 2003 (short-war assumption), Vietnam escalation (no long-war fiscal/coalition strategy) |
| **05 Coalition primacy** | Iraq 2003 (no UNSC, NATO split), unilateral Latin American interventions |
| **06 Dual-ocean denial** | (Rarely violated; Pearl Harbor 1941 as denial failure in Pacific) |
| **07 Myth as stabilizer** | Iraq/Afghanistan nation-building (myth as engine), manifest destiny (19th c.) |

## Surprising results

- **Procedure reasserted:** Bay of Pigs → ExComm/OAS; Watergate → oversight norms; Iran–Contra → investigations. Violation triggered corrective reinforcement of procedure.
- **Defeat processed:** Vietnam — violation of 04, but exit eventually procedurally managed (03 partly held); legitimacy did not fully collapse.
- **Myth-as-engine failure:** Iraq 2003 — nation-building narrative failed visibly; reduced future appetite for same pattern (doctrine-reinforcing effect).
- **Repudiation and redress:** Japanese internment — later codified as wrong (Civil Liberties Act 1988, reparations); procedure and narrative turned against the violation.

## Precedents for exit without rupture

- **Yorktown** (MEM–ANGLIA–WAR–AMERICAN–INDEPENDENCE–YORKTOWN): Defeat then procedural exit; Parliament, treaty; Doctrine 03 clean case.
- **Canada** (MEM–ANGLIA–CANADA): Procedural autonomy without military defeat; evolution, not rupture. Supports Option C (lighten footprint) as “recalibration” not “retreat.”

*Session synthesis: Violations do not always compound; corrective reassertion, managed exit, and repudiation are recurring patterns. SCHOLAR SYNTHESIS 0003 (candidate); STATE Section VII pattern “Exit Without Rupture” added.*
