I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves Franklin D. Roosevelt as **America's crisis
steward and executive-scale amplifier**: the figure who confronted
economic collapse (New Deal) and total war (Second World War) through
prolonged presidential tenure, institutional innovation, and
coalition leadership—stretching procedure to absorb emergency
without abandoning form.

FDR does not found a new order.
He **extends** the republic's capacity to survive depression and
war by expanding the executive, the federal role, and the
legitimacy of continuous leadership.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. CRISIS ENTRY: DEPRESSION & NEW DEAL
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Roosevelt assumes office (1933) at the nadir of the Great Depression.

Context:
• Bank failures; unemployment; collapse of demand
• New Deal—relief, recovery, reform; federal programmes; agencies
• Court-packing attempt (1937)—rebuffed; procedure constrains
  executive ambition
• Legitimacy through **action and communication**—fireside chats;
  government as active guarantor of security

The state becomes **provider and regulator** on a new scale.
Procedure is stretched; it is not discarded.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. EXECUTIVE EXPANSION & FOUR TERMS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Roosevelt is elected four times (1932, 1936, 1940, 1944).

Implications:
• Two-term precedent (Washington through Roosevelt's cousin Theodore)
  is broken by war and continuity demand
• Post-FDR: Twenty-second Amendment (1951)—two-term limit codified
• Legitimacy of prolonged tenure under emergency; then procedure
  closes the option

The republic **absorbs** the exception and then **binds** it.
Roosevelt's tenure is the catalyst for constitutional codification
of limit.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. WAR LEADERSHIP & COALITION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Roosevelt leads the United States into and through the Second World War.

Roles:
• Arsenal of Democracy; Lend-Lease; alliance with Britain and
  Soviet Union
• Atlantic Charter (1941)—Anglo-American war aims; self-determination;
  no territorial aggrandizement
• Wartime summits (Casablanca, Tehran, Yalta); coalition management
• Death in office (April 1945); Truman succeeds before final victory

Legitimacy is **alliance-bound**: victory depends on coalition;
procedure (succession) holds despite leader loss.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. INSTITUTIONAL INNOVATION & WELFARE STATE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The New Deal creates durable federal structures.

Examples:
• Social Security; labour rights; financial regulation
• Executive branch growth; agencies and boards
• Legitimacy of **security**—economic and social—as government
  responsibility

The procedural state expands its domain. Later retrenchment or
revision does not erase the precedent: the federal government
can act as insurer, employer of last resort, and regulator at scale.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. RHETORIC & CONTINUITY OF PRESENCE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Roosevelt sustains legitimacy through communication and visibility.

Patterns:
• Fireside chats—intimacy and explanation
• Staged accessibility (disability managed in public image)
• War as "we"—collective frame; unity of purpose

Authority is **narrative** as well as institutional. The president
explains, reassures, and mobilizes. Procedure is accompanied by
voice.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Franklin Roosevelt encodes **crisis stewardship and executive
scale under emergency**.

Lessons:
• Depression and war can be met by expanding federal and executive
  role without abandoning constitutional form.
• Prolonged tenure under emergency is absorbed; then procedure
  codifies limit (Twenty-second Amendment).
• Coalition warfare requires legitimacy to be shared—alliance,
  charter, summit—not only unilateral.
• Institutional innovation (New Deal) creates new legitimacy
  expectations; the state as provider and regulator becomes
  a durable frame.
• Succession holds despite leader death in office; procedure
  outlives the figure.

FDR is America's **crisis steward**: Lincoln-scale emergency,
extended over depression and war, with procedure stretched then
rebound.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VIII. MEM CONNECTIONS (MANDATORY)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
AMERICA:
• MEM–AMERICA–LINCOLN — Crisis presidency; executive stretch to
  preserve union; FDR as second great crisis steward; procedure
  over consent in extremis.
• MEM–AMERICA–ROOSEVELT–THEODORE — Cousin; executive energy and
  bully pulpit; FDR extends scale (four terms, New Deal, global
  war); contrast in duration and scope.
• MEM–AMERICA–WASHINGTON — Restraint and voluntary exit; FDR as
  counterpoint—continuous tenure; Washington's precedent is
  overridden then codified in reaction.
• MEM–AMERICA–GRANT — War leadership and post-war transition;
  FDR dies before peace; succession under war as procedural test.
• MEM–AMERICA–MONROE — Hemisphere doctrine; FDR's war is global
  but Atlantic alliance (Britain) echoes Monroe-era offshore logic.

ANGLIA (where not yet migrated):
• MEM–ANGLIA–GEO–ATLANTIC — Atlantic as alliance space; Lend-Lease;
  Atlantic Charter; maritime coalition.
• MEM–ANGLIA–WAR–NAPOLEON — Coalition against hegemon; FDR's
  alliance against Axis as structural parallel (maritime and
  continental coalition).

Cross-references denote lineage, not equivalence.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IX. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Crisis justifies executive and federal expansion; procedure
  stretches then rebounds (term limit).
• Prolonged tenure is legitimized by emergency; then procedure
  forbids repetition.
• Coalition warfare binds legitimacy to alliance; victory is
  shared.
• New Deal creates durable expectations of state role; legitimacy
  of security and regulation.
• Succession under war holds; procedure outlives the leader.
• FDR is Lincoln's second act—depression and war, executive
  scale, procedure preserved under strain.

Tension preserved without verdict.
