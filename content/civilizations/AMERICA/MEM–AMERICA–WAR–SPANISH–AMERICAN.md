I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves the Spanish–American War as **America's
first extra-hemispheric projection**: the brief conflict (1898)
in which the United States declared war on Spain over Cuba,
deployed naval and expeditionary force, and acquired Cuba
(indirect control), Puerto Rico, Philippines, and Guam—pivoting
from continental expansion toward **maritime power and overseas
access** while framing war as liberation.

For America, the war is **naval and nodal**—control and access
over territory; procedure (declaration, treaty) and legitimacy
(liberation rhetoric) mask strategic expansion.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. CONTEXT: CUBA, NAVAL DOCTRINE, INDUSTRIAL REACH
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The war emerges from hemispheric concern and naval ambition.

Context:
• Cuban rebellion against Spain; U.S. sympathy and interest;
  Maine explosion (1898)—casus belli; Congress declares war
• Mahanian naval doctrine—sea power as determinant; need for
  bases and coaling stations; Pacific and Caribbean access
• Industrial and naval capacity; completed continental
  consolidation; declining Spain as low-risk opponent

War is **justified as liberation** (Cuba) and **executed as
access** (Philippines, Guam, Puerto Rico). Procedure (congressional
declaration, Treaty of Paris 1898) legitimises outcome.

John Keegan, in *A History of Warfare* (1993), on institutional
restraint and the form of state violence:

SOURCE — Keegan, *A History of Warfare* (ARC-T-MODERN):
> "Our institutions and our laws, we tell ourselves, have set the human
> potentiality for violence about with such restraints that violence in
> everyday life will be punished as criminal by our laws, while its use
> by our institutions of state will take the particular form of
> 'civilised warfare.'"
> — John Keegan, *A History of Warfare* (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1993) (ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-SECONDARY].

The Spanish–American War is **framed** by declaration and **closed**
by treaty; expansion takes the form of civilised warfare and
procedure, not extra-institutional violence.

III. OPERATIONAL CONDUCT: NAVAL DECISIVENESS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The conflict is short and one-sided.

Elements:
• Naval superiority decisive—Manila Bay, Santiago de Cuba;
  Spanish fleet destroyed or blockaded
• Expeditionary and joint operations—Rough Riders (TR), land
  campaigns in Cuba and Philippines; coordination of naval and
  land force
• Minimal mass mobilisation; rapid deployment; industrial–naval
  integration

Victory reflects **system projection**—logistical reach,
institutional confidence, and maritime primacy. This is not
continental annexation (Mexican–American War) but **node and
access** acquisition.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. OUTCOMES: CUBA, PUERTO RICO, PHILIPPINES, GUAM
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Treaty of Paris (1898) redefines American footprint.

Results:
• Cuba—independence under U.S. influence; Platt Amendment;
  indirect control, not annexation
• Puerto Rico—annexed; U.S. territory
• Philippines—ceded to U.S.; overseas possession; subsequent
  insurrection and suppression; colonial governance and moral
  tension
• Guam—naval node; Pacific access

Territory is **instrumental**—control and access over settlement;
liberation rhetoric (Cuba) coexists with colonial rule (Philippines).
Procedure contains dissent; anti-imperial debate surfaces but
does not reverse outcome.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Spanish–American War encodes **expansion by maritime procedure
and nodal access**.

Lessons:
• Sea power can substitute for continental annexation; naval
  superiority and expeditionary force enable extra-hemispheric
  projection.
• War can be framed as liberation (Cuba) while producing
  colonial outcomes (Philippines); legitimacy framing conditions
  durability and debate.
• Procedural initiation (declaration, treaty) legitimises
  acquisition; civilian supremacy and Congress hold.
• First extra-hemispheric war—America becomes global naval
  power; Pacific and Caribbean nodes secured; contrast with
  Mexican–American War (continental absorption).

The war is America's **maritime pivot**: Cuba, Philippines,
naval dominance, and overseas footprint.

VI. MEM CONNECTIONS (MANDATORY)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
AMERICA:
• MEM–AMERICA–ROOSEVELT–THEODORE — Rough Riders; naval and
  expeditionary; bully pulpit and hemispheric assertion; Spanish–
  American War as formative.
• MEM–AMERICA–MONROE — Hemisphere doctrine; Cuba in hemisphere;
  extra-hemispheric extension (Philippines) as supplement to
  hemisphere perimeter.
• MEM–AMERICA–WAR–MEXICAN–AMERICAN — Contrast: continental
  annexation vs. maritime and nodal acquisition; territorial
  absorption vs. control and access.
• MEM–AMERICA–KENNEDY — Cuba again (Bay of Pigs, Missile Crisis);
  hemisphere perimeter; Spanish–American War as first U.S. stake
  in Cuba.
• MEM–AMERICA–GEO–ATLANTIC — Maritime core; naval projection;
  Caribbean and Atlantic access.
• MEM–AMERICA–GEO–PACIFIC–OCEAN — Philippines, Guam; Pacific
  dimension of U.S. reach secured by this war.

Cross-Civilizational:
• MEM–ANGLIA–WAR–SPANISH–AMERICAN — Anglian encoding (maritime
  reassertion through American extension); same war, same
  strategic grammar.

Cross-references denote lineage, not equivalence.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Naval power enables extra-hemispheric projection; nodes and
  access over continental absorption.
• Liberation rhetoric and colonial governance coexist; procedure
  contains moral tension.
• First U.S. war for overseas territory; global naval power
  emerges.
• Spanish–American War is the maritime corrective to Mexican–
  American continental expansion.

Tension preserved without verdict.
