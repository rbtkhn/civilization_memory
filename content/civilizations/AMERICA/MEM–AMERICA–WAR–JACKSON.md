I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves **Andrew Jackson as war figure**: his military
campaigns—Creek War (Horseshoe Bend 1814), Battle of New Orleans
(1815), and First Seminole War / Florida (1818)—and the role of
martial victory in his later political legitimacy. It is distinct
from MEM–AMERICA–PRESIDENT–JACKSON (populist political figure); here
the focus is **Jackson the general**—the commander who repelled the
British at New Orleans (after the Treaty of Ghent), crushed Creek
resistance, and extended American force into Spanish Florida, becoming
the hero who would later channel popular authority into the presidency.

It seems to me that the crucial point is that New Orleans, though
fought after peace was signed, encoded **American defensive victory**
and martial legitimacy in popular memory. The question, really, is
how Jackson's war record—frontier violence, Indian fighting, and the
spectacular repulse of a British assault—supplied the legitimacy base
for his populist presidency. One has to understand that his authority
as "man of the people" rested in part on his identity as the victor
of New Orleans and the conqueror of Creeks and Seminoles. Institutional
continuity is strained: the same figure who enforced Indian Removal
and personalised executive power had first built his name in the
field.

The fact is that the structural picture was clear: the War of 1812
ended in status quo (Ghent); American invasions of Canada had failed.
New Orleans did not change the treaty—but it gave the U.S. a narrative
of martial triumph and made Jackson the embodiment of that triumph.
The name of the game for Jackson was to win battles, secure the
southern frontier, and project American force into Florida; his
incentive structure was personal glory, territorial expansion, and
the consolidation of white settlement at the expense of Native
allies and Spanish sovereignty.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

II. CREEK WAR & HORSESHOE BEND (1814)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Creek War (1813–1814) pitted the Red Stick Creeks against the
United States and allied Creeks. Jackson, commanding Tennessee militia
and U.S. forces, pursued a campaign of decisive engagement.

Elements:
• Battle of Horseshoe Bend (March 1814)—Jackson's force attacked
  Red Stick fortification on the Tallapoosa River; heavy Creek
  casualties; Creek military power broken
• Treaty of Fort Jackson (August 1814)—Creeks ceded vast territory
  (much of Alabama and Georgia); land opened for white settlement
• Jackson's reputation as aggressive commander and Indian fighter
  established; Tennessee and the Southwest as his base

The campaign encodes **expansion through military victory**: Native
resistance crushed, territory transferred by treaty, Jackson as the
instrument of that transfer. The legitimacy frame is security and
settlement; the structural outcome is the removal of a barrier to
American territorial growth.

III. BATTLE OF NEW ORLEANS (JANUARY 1815)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The British launched an assault on New Orleans after the Treaty of
Ghent had been signed (December 1814) but before news reached the
theatre. Jackson had fortified the approach; British frontal attacks
were repelled with heavy losses; Jackson became the hero of the war.

Elements:
• British objective: seize New Orleans and control the Mississippi
  gateway; Pakenham's assault (8 January 1815)
• American defence: earthworks, artillery, militia and regulars;
  Jackson's leadership; British defeat; Pakenham killed
• War already ended by treaty; battle did not alter terms—but it
  encoded **American defensive victory** and **martial legitimacy**
  in popular memory
• Jackson's national fame; "Old Hickory"; basis for later political
  appeal

MEM–AMERICA–WAR–1812 frames the war as assertion and stalemate;
New Orleans is the symbolic victory that Americans remember. Jackson
personifies that victory.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. FLORIDA & FIRST SEMINOLE WAR (1818)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Jackson led a punitive expedition into Spanish Florida (1818) against
Seminoles and escaped slaves, and captured Spanish posts (e.g. St.
Marks, Pensacola). Spain had weak control; the U.S. had a structural
incentive to eliminate raiding and to pressure Spain to cede Florida.
Jackson exceeded orders—he executed two British subjects—and provoked
diplomatic crisis; ultimately the Adams–Onís Treaty (1819) transferred
Florida to the United States. So Jackson's military action **forced
the diplomatic outcome**: expansion by force, then regularised by
treaty.

The pattern repeats: aggressive use of force, territorial gain,
controversy over authority (did he exceed orders?), and consolidation
of American control. His war record—Creek, New Orleans, Florida—made
him the martial hero who could later claim to speak for "the people"
against elites.

V. MEM CONNECTIONS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• MEM–AMERICA–PRESIDENT–JACKSON — PARALLELS: Same figure; this MEM
  encodes war role; that MEM encodes populist political role and
  Bank War, Indian Removal.
• MEM–AMERICA–WAR–1812 — DEPENDS_ON: New Orleans is the war's
  defining American victory; Jackson is the war's defining American
  commander.
• MEM–AMERICA–MANIFEST–DESTINY — PARALLELS: Expansion by force and
  treaty; Jackson operationalises expansion in the Southeast.
• MEM–AMERICA–PRESIDENT–ADAMS–JQ — TEMPORAL_AFTER: Adams–Onís Treaty
  (1819) regularises Florida acquisition after Jackson's campaign.
• MEM–AMERICA–WAR–AMERICAN–CIVIL–STONEWALL–JACKSON — PARALLELS:
  Different Jackson (Thomas J.); naming contrast; no direct link.
• MEM–AMERICA–LAW–SUPREME–COURT — TEMPORAL_AFTER: Jackson's defiance
  of Court (Worcester, Indian Removal) as president echoes his
  martial disregard for limits.
