# Presidential Doctrine Brief — Seven Strategic Principles

**For:** POTUS  
**From:** National Security Advisor  
**Derived from:** U.S. civilizational doctrine set (authoritative registry: CIV–DOCTRINE–AMERICA)  
**Use:** Quick reference for major foreign-policy and national-security decisions. Not a substitute for law or for full NSS; use to stress-test options and messaging.

## 1. Process over personality

**In one line:** Authority lives in institutions and process, not in you or any single person.

**What it means:** Our legitimacy and continuity come from Congress, the Constitution, treaties, and precedent. Big moves (use of force, major commitments or withdrawals) need to run through the right process and be seen as procedural. If we bypass or short-circuit that, we burn legitimacy.

**Do:** Bring Congress and key allies into the loop for big decisions. Frame decisions as consistent with law and precedent.  
**Don’t:** Personalise authority or imply that your word alone is the source of legitimacy.  
**Watch:** Any option that requires ignoring or sidelining Congress or treaty process.

## 2. After rupture: repurpose, don’t erase

**In one line:** When something breaks (allies, partners, post-conflict), aim for institutional continuity and new elites adopting our rules, not wiping the slate clean.

**What it means:** We survive big shocks when institutions are rebuilt or repurposed and new elites work within a procedural order (Reconstruction, post‑1945 Germany/Japan). We fail when we try to erase institutions or when new elites rule by raw coercion only.

**Do:** In post-conflict or post-crisis settings, prioritise institutions and rules, not just new faces.  
**Don’t:** Treat "regime change" as licence to destroy institutions with no replacement order.  
**Watch:** Scenarios where we're tempted to impose outcomes without a credible institutional path.

## 3. Exit with a process, not a panic

**In one line:** We can lose wars, pull back, or retrench without a legitimacy crisis—if we do it through open process and own it as a choice.

**What it means:** Retreat or recalibration is a valid strategic option. The risk is doing it in a way that looks like collapse or betrayal. Legitimacy holds when exit is debated, decided, and communicated as policy—not when we deny reality until the last minute.

**Do:** Plan exits and drawdowns in advance; use Congress and allies; frame as "reprioritisation" or "strategic choice" where that's accurate.  
**Don't:** Hang on until the last moment, then leave in chaos, or let the story be "we were forced out."  
**Watch:** Any commitment where we have no credible exit or recalibration plan and no narrative for it.

---

## 4. Time is a weapon—use it

**In one line:** We win by outlasting and out-sustaining, not by winning one big battle. Delay favours us if our finances and alliances hold.

**What it means:** Our edge is fiscal staying power and alliance durability (Cold War, NATO, Marshall Plan). We want long games we can afford and coalitions that don't crack. Quick, decisive fights are riskier; open-ended wars without an exit or a coalition are worst.

**Do:** Invest in alliance cohesion and fiscal sustainability; prefer containment and pressure over "decisive" campaigns.  
**Don't:** Bet on short, cheap victories or let coalitions fray without a plan.  
**Watch:** Fiscal overstretch or alliance fracture—both kill the time advantage.

---

## 5. Coalitions carry legitimacy and cost

**In one line:** Our legitimacy and burden-sharing come from allies and multilateral frameworks. We lead best when we're seen as first among equals, not alone.

**What it means:** NATO, UN, and key alliances are where we get legitimacy and shared cost. Going it alone is possible but expensive in legitimacy and resources. "Coalition of the willing" works only if the coalition is real and visible.

**Do:** Build and maintain real coalitions; share credit and burden; keep key allies consulted and committed.  
**Don't:** Treat allies as optional or transactional; don't surprise them on big moves.  
**Watch:** Any policy that could be read as "America alone" or "we're walking away from the alliance."

---

## 6. Both oceans matter

**In one line:** We need to deny hostile dominance in both the Atlantic and the Pacific. Sea control and alliance assurance in both theaters are non-negotiable.

**What it means:** Our security and our allies' depend on maritime dominance and denial in both oceans. Letting one theater slip (e.g. Europe or Asia) to "focus" on the other risks the whole position. We don't have to conquer; we have to deny and assure.

**Do:** Keep naval and alliance posture in both Europe and Asia; resist "choose one ocean" pressure.  
**Don't:** Trade one theater away for the other, or let basing/logistics erode in either.  
**Watch:** Budget or policy choices that effectively abandon one ocean or one set of allies.

---

## 7. Narrative supports; it doesn't replace

**In one line:** Story and symbolism stabilise support; they don't create capability or substitute for process and capacity.

**What it means:** "Leader of the free world" and similar narratives help at home and with allies only if they're consistent with what we actually do and can do. If we promise more than we can deliver, or if our story and our procedure clash, narrative turns from stabiliser to liability.

**Do:** Use narrative to explain and reinforce real policy and capacity; keep rhetoric aligned with deliverables.  
**Don't:** Use rhetoric to paper over gaps between promise and performance.  
**Watch:** Big speeches or commitments that aren't backed by process, resources, or coalition.

## Quick checklist for big decisions

- [ ] **Process:** Is Congress/alliance process being respected and used?
- [ ] **Exit:** If this is a commitment, do we have an exit or recalibration path and a story for it?
- [ ] **Time:** Does this play to our staying power and coalition, or to a short, brittle bet?
- [ ] **Coalition:** Are we acting with allies and sharing legitimacy and burden?
- [ ] **Two oceans:** Does this keep both Atlantic and Pacific posture intact?
- [ ] **Narrative:** Does our story match what we're actually doing and able to do?

## Contingency and luck

These principles **reduce risk** over many decisions; they don't guarantee any one outcome. Results also depend on contingency—opponent choices, events, luck. Following the checklist increases the share of outcomes you can influence and reduces dependence on good luck. Violating it can still "work" in a single case when luck runs your way; the cost is precedent and greater fragility next time. Don't over-infer from one success or one failure.
