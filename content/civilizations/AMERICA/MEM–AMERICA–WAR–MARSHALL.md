I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves **George C. Marshall as war figure**: his role
as U.S. Army Chief of Staff (1939–1945)—mobilization, strategy,
coalition coordination, and the direction of the army that fought
in Europe and the Pacific. Marshall was not a theatre or field
commander; he was the **architect and manager** of American ground
force: expansion from a small pre-war army to a global force,
Europe-first priority, selection of theatre commanders (Eisenhower,
others), and the logistical and strategic frame for D-Day and
continental campaign. His later service as Secretary of State
(Marshall Plan) belongs to post-war diplomacy; here the focus is
**Marshall the wartime chief of staff**.

It seems to me that the crucial point is that American victory in
WWII required turning a tiny peacetime army into a force capable of
fighting in two hemispheres. The question, really, is who built
that force and set its strategic priorities. Marshall did: he
advocated and sustained Europe-first (Germany before Japan), he
backed the cross-Channel invasion and the choice of Eisenhower to
lead it, and he managed the relationship between War Department and
White House. One has to understand that his legitimacy rested on
**organizational and strategic judgment**—not on battlefields but
in Washington. Institutional continuity appears in civilian control
preserved: Marshall served Roosevelt and Truman; he advised, the
president decided.

The fact is that the structural picture was clear: the United States
had to raise, equip, and deploy an army while coordinating with
Britain and (after 1941) the Soviet Union. Marshall's incentive
structure was to get the maximum effective force into the European
theatre at the right time—to win the war without exhausting the
nation or breaking the coalition. The name of the game was
mobilization, alliance management, and commander selection; Marshall
was the central figure in all three.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

II. CHIEF OF STAFF: MOBILIZATION & STRATEGY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Marshall became Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army on 1 September 1939—
the day Germany invaded Poland. He held the post for the entire war.

Trajectory:
• **1939–1941** — Expansion of the army; draft (1940); training
  and doctrine; preparation for possible conflict; Lend-Lease and
  coordination with Britain
• **1941–1943** — After Pearl Harbor, full mobilization; Europe-first
  decision (Germany first, Japan second) sustained against Pacific
  pressure; North Africa and Mediterranean operations (Torch, Sicily,
  Italy) as prelude to France; selection of Eisenhower for European
  theatre
• **1944–1945** — Overlord (D-Day) and Normandy campaign; Marshall
  had advocated cross-Channel invasion; logistics and deployment
  under his direction; push into Germany; V-E Day; Pacific build-up
  (MacArthur, Nimitz) under same War Department frame

Marshall did not command in the field. He **built the army, chose
the commanders, and held the strategic line** in Washington—Europe
first, cross-Channel when feasible, coalition unity with Britain.
His relationship with Roosevelt was direct; he presented options,
the president decided. Churchill and the British chiefs negotiated
with him; the Combined Chiefs structure reflected his standing.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. COMMANDER SELECTION & CIVILIAN SUBORDINATION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Marshall's choice of Eisenhower as Supreme Commander Allied
Expeditionary Force (Europe) encoded **theatre command under
civilian authority**: the chief of staff picked the man who would
execute the invasion; the president approved. Marshall himself
wanted to command Overlord but accepted Roosevelt's decision that
he was indispensable in Washington. That refusal of the glamour
post—staying at the centre of coordination rather than taking the
field—encodes the same norm as Washington's surrender of command:
**procedure and institutional role over personal ambition**.

Legacy: Marshall Plan (1947–1952) as Secretary of State—European
recovery, containment, economic investment as strategic tool—flows
from his wartime understanding of coalition and stability. The
war MEM does not elaborate the Plan; it notes the continuity:
the same figure who built the wartime alliance later designed
the peacetime recovery framework.
