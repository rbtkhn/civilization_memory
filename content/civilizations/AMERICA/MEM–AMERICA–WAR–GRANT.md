I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves **Ulysses S. Grant as war figure**: his command
in the Civil War—Western theatre (Fort Henry, Fort Donelson, Shiloh,
Vicksburg, Chattanooga), promotion to General-in-Chief, the Overland
Campaign and Petersburg against Lee, and the surrender at Appomattox.
It is distinct from MEM–AMERICA–PRESIDENT–GRANT (political figure,
Reconstruction, Memoirs); here the focus is **Grant the commander**—
the general who applied attrition and continuous engagement, accepted
civilian authority, and ended the war with procedural terms.

It seems to me that the crucial point is that Grant did not win by
brilliant maneuver or a single decisive battle. He won by **relentless
pressure**—engagement, denial of recovery, acceptance of cost—until
Confederate capacity broke. The question, really, is how the Union
turned stalemate into conclusion. Grant's answer was to fight
continuously, to use the North's material and numerical advantage
without waiting for the perfect moment, and to frame surrender as
restoration so that the war could end without social inversion. One
has to understand that his legitimacy rested on **execution under
Lincoln**: he did not set war aims; he executed them. Institutional
continuity appears in civilian subordination and in the Appomattox
terms—parole, no imprisonment, "the rebels are our countrymen again."

The fact is that the structural picture was clear: the Union had
the resources to outlast the Confederacy if it was willing to pay
the cost. Grant's incentive structure was to make the war **unavoidable**
for the enemy—no respite, no chance to regroup—and to offer exit
through surrender on terms that preserved procedural reintegration.
The name of the game was attrition and closure; Grant was the
instrument of both.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

II. WESTERN THEATRE: FORT HENRY TO VICKSBURG
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Grant's rise began in the Western theatre.

Trajectory:
• **1862** — Fort Henry, Fort Donelson ("Unconditional surrender");
  Shiloh (costly; Grant held the field; controversy and resilience);
  Halleck's consolidation; Grant as commander in the West
• **1863** — Vicksburg campaign: maneuver, siege, surrender (July 4);
  Mississippi controlled; Confederacy split; Grant's operational
  signature—persistence, encirclement, supply and engineering over
  frontal assault when frontal assault failed
• **Chattanooga (November 1863)** — Grant brought to relieve the
  siege; Missionary Ridge; Union victory; Lincoln promotes him

Churchill, in *The Great Democracies*, on Grant's emergence:

SOURCE — Churchill, *The Great Democracies* (Vol. 4) (ARC-T-MODERN):
> "Grant proposed a winter advance up the Tennessee River and an attack upon Fort Henry. Halleck approved. Grant made the advance, and the advance made Grant."
> — Winston S. Churchill, *A History of the English-Speaking Peoples*, Vol. 4, *The Great Democracies* (1956–1958), ch. 12 (ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-SECONDARY].

Grant's method: **move, engage, persist**. When assault failed
(Vicksburg), he shifted to siege; when the line broke (Chattanooga),
he exploited. No theatrical genius—systematic pressure.

III. GENERAL-IN-CHIEF & OVERLAND CAMPAIGN
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Lincoln brought Grant east as General-in-Chief (March 1864). Grant
would fight Lee directly while coordinating all Union armies.

Sequence:
• **Overland Campaign (May–June 1864)** — Wilderness, Spotsylvania,
  Cold Harbor; Grant did not retreat after setbacks; he moved
  south and east, keeping pressure on Lee; high casualties;
  "I propose to fight it out on this line if it takes all summer"
• **Petersburg (June 1864–April 1865)** — Siege of Richmond–Petersburg;
  Grant fixed Lee in place; Sherman in Georgia, Sheridan in the
  Valley; Union material and numerical advantage told
• **Appomattox (April 1865)** — Lee's army surrounded; Grant offered
  terms: parole, no imprisonment, officers keep sidearms, soldiers
  return home; Lee accepted; "The war is over; the rebels are our
  countrymen again."

Grant did not seek annihilation. He sought **submission and
reintegration**. The surrender terms encoded procedural termination—
victory without revolutionary purge. He had known Lee in the old
army; at Appomattox he treated him as a former comrade who had
laid down arms.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. CIVILIAN SUBORDINATION & LEGACY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Grant accepted Lincoln's authority throughout. He did not grandstand,
did not threaten politics, did not demand policy changes. He executed
the war the president had set. That subordination—the general who
finishes the war and then obeys—reaffirms the Washington precedent:
**force serves civilian authority**. After the war Grant became
president (1869–1877); his political record is in the figure MEM.
Here the war legacy is clear: **attrition, closure, and procedural
surrender**—the commander who ended the argument without breaking
the system.
