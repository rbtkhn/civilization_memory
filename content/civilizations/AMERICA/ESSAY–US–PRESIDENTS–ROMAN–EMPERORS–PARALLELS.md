It seems to me that the most useful way to approach a parallel between American presidents and Roman emperors is not to force a one-to-one mapping—which would do violence to both traditions—but to ask how legitimacy and institutional continuity operate in each. The crucial point, surely, is that both politics had to solve the same kind of problem: how to distribute or concentrate authority after a founding rupture, and how to make succession and crisis survivable without abandoning the grammar that made the community recognisable to itself.

If one reads the American president MEMs with that lens, a pattern emerges. Washington does not invent American legitimacy; he carries Anglian procedural grammar across the Atlantic while severing imperial sovereignty. He resigns command, refuses monarchy, accepts term limits. That is rupture in allegiance, continuity in form. One might argue that Augustus, in the Roman memory, does something structurally similar: he does not abolish the Republic; he empties it of sovereignty while preserving its language, rituals, and offices. Violence is foundational—Actium, the defeat of rivals—but then force disappears from view. The settlement of 27 BC is "restoration" in name; in substance, Mommsen tells us, it is monarchic. So too Washington: the general who could have had a crown and laid it down, so that the republic could be inhabited rather than proclaimed. The difference, of course, is that the American founding had no prior civil war among equals on the same soil—it was secession from an external sovereign—and the constitutional machine that followed was designed to prevent a single person from ever holding what Augustus in fact held. But the *gesture* of restraint, the encoding of legitimacy through renunciation, seems to me to run in parallel.

Adams then completes the first succession. His contribution is legal and diplomatic: empire of laws, not of men; balanced government; procedure over faction. He translates rebellion into the language of the realm. In the Roman sequence, Tiberius is the first heir: he inherits the Principate by design, not acclaim. He has no founding victory, no revolutionary moment—only the structure Augustus left. Tiberius governs with discipline and restraint; Gibbon has him preserving the empire in peace while his vices render him incapable of enjoying it. Stability without affection. One has to understand that Adams, too, was not loved as Washington was; his legitimacy was procedural—the first peaceful transfer of executive power—and his legacy was the articulation of structure rather than the warmth of symbol. So we get a rough parallel: the legal-diplomatic executor who secures the first succession and embodies continuity without charisma.

Jefferson declares; Madison engineers. Jefferson universalises inherited norms into the language of natural rights and equality; Madison builds the machine—separation of powers, ambition countering ambition, faction as permanent condition to be managed rather than purged. In Rome there is no exact pair, but perhaps one might see in the Republic’s mixed constitution (Senate, people, magistracy—Polybius’ balance) the same instinct: structure absorbs flaw; institutions oblige power to control itself. Hadrian, in the imperial line, later does something different but analogous: he halts expansion and institutionalises borders; he makes empire a system to be maintained rather than a frontier to be pushed. That is a kind of engineering—the conversion of conquest into durability. Madison’s conversion is of suspicion of power into durable collision. Both are civilisational grammar: how to persist without trusting the ruler.

Monroe territorialises restraint. The Monroe Doctrine declares a perimeter—no new European colonisation, non-interference—before the United States can fully enforce it. Power is signalled before it is possessed; the declaration substitutes for immediate force. One might see in Augustus’ refusal to annex beyond a certain point, or in the *pax Romana* as a declared order rather than infinite conquest, a similar move: the perimeter as legitimacy technology. Rome and America both learn to say where they will not go, and to make that saying part of their identity.

Jackson presses the system from below. Populism redefines legitimacy without redesigning structure; personal authority and mass emotion test how much institutional restraint can absorb. The MEM encodes him as Anglia’s populist rupture figure. In Rome, the analogue is not a single emperor so much as a recurring tension: the prince who appeals to the plebs or the army over the senate, the Caligula or Nero who personalises rule and breaks the Augustan disguise. Or perhaps the Gracchi, earlier—though they are republican. The point is that Jackson embodies a moment when procedure is *pressurised* by a new source of legitimacy (the people as moral source, direct mandate). Rome repeatedly faced the same pressure—when the army or the crowd became the arbiter of who held the purple. America contained it within the ballot and the veto; Rome did not always contain it. But the structural question is the same: what happens when legitimacy shifts from institutional continuity to personal or popular acclamation?

Polk executes expansion through procedure: one term, congressional declaration of war, treaty. He does not break the republic; he extends it by process. Trajan, in the Roman MEMs, is the apex expansionary emperor—Dacian wars, maximum territorial extent, conquest-based legitimacy sustained through discipline and public benefaction. Gibbon has the Roman world in full tide of prosperity and peace under Trajan; expansion appears safe and rational. Polk’s expansion is likewise framed as delivery of a mandate—Texas, Oregon, Mexico—through institutional forms. The parallel is the *expansionist who uses procedure*: war by declaration, annexation by treaty. Trajan leaves the empire at its greatest reach; Polk leaves the United States continental. Both encode a moment when growth and legitimacy align, before the costs of overstretch or sectional crisis become dominant.

Lincoln is the procedural saviour in extremis. He preserves institutional continuity through total war; he redefines legitimacy and moral purpose without abandoning constitutional form. He does not perfect the republic—he forces it to survive itself. In the Roman corpus, Constantine is the great translator of power after crisis: he reconstitutes imperial legitimacy by fusing military autocracy, Christian sacral authority, and administrative centralisation. He emerges from the wreckage of the Third Century; his problem is not conquest but re-legitimation. Lincoln’s problem is the same: the union has broken; secession has weaponised constitutional ambiguity. Both figures restore unity and redefine the basis of authority—Lincoln through Gettysburg and the Thirteenth Amendment, Constantine through Nicaea and the new Rome. Victory precedes legitimacy; but victory alone is not enough. The *meaning* of the polity must be restated. One might argue that Lincoln is the closer parallel to Constantine than to any of the "good" emperors—the one who holds the centre when the centre has failed.

Grant finishes the argument. He does not justify the system; he enforces its conclusion through attrition and procedural surrender at Appomattox. He is the general who makes the war end. In Rome, one might think of Vespasian or Titus after the Year of the Four Emperors—the military figure who restores order and hands back a working structure. Grant’s presidency is then the difficult aftermath: enforcement of Reconstruction, then exposure of corruption. He gets the big issues right, Chernow says, even if he bungles many of the small ones. The parallel is the *enforcer who secures the peace* and then must govern in the shadow of that achievement.

McKinley extends the republic beyond the hemisphere—gold standard, Spanish–American War, Hawaii, Philippines, Open Door. He is cautious and methodical; he does not break the republic, he extends it. Trajan again offers a structural echo: expansion as rational policy, empire at confidence. Or perhaps Hadrian’s predecessor in the sense that McKinley sets the conditions for a later consolidation—Theodore Roosevelt inherits the design; McKinley is the author. Theodore Roosevelt then amplifies: executive energiser, big stick, trust-busting, conservation. He does not break the republic; he stretches the presidency as bully pulpit. One might see in Trajan’s vigour and public benefaction a similar type—the active prince who embodies the state’s energy. FDR, by contrast, is the crisis steward: depression and total war, four terms, executive expansion, then the Twenty-second Amendment that codifies the two-term limit. The republic absorbs the exception and then binds it. In Rome, Diocletian restructures the empire under crisis—tetrarchy, administrative division—and Constantine then consolidates. FDR’s New Deal and war leadership are not tetrarchy, but they are a similar move: procedure stretched to absorb emergency, then procedure closing the option so that the exception does not become the norm.

Truman inherits. He is the succession president: FDR’s death, Potsdam, atomic use, surrender, then containment. He does not found the Cold War alone; he inherits victory and declares containment. Procedure holds through sudden succession and through the removal of MacArthur. The buck stops here. In Rome, Titus might be the parallel—short reign, inheritance of a father’s achievement, consolidation rather than innovation. Eisenhower then embodies institutional and coalitional legitimacy: the general who held the alliance together, then the president who held containment and procedure without dramatic rupture. Restraint and continuity—Antoninus Pius, perhaps, or the Marcus Aurelius who prefers duty to glory. Kennedy is the unfinished symbol: crisis manager (Cuban Missile Crisis), perimeter enforcer (quarantine), then assassination. Legacy mythologised; procedure holds through succession despite leader loss. One might think of the young emperor cut short—the "what if" that Rome and America both encode.

Nixon tests procedure. He extends diplomacy (opening to China, détente) and then violates procedure (Watergate). Resignation and succession under constraint; the office survives the man. Rome offers the Year of the Four Emperors, or the fall of Domitian—procedure reasserting after the ruler’s abuse. The republic does not abandon Nixon’s realpolitik; it abandons Nixon. So too Rome, in Tacitus’ telling, could survive a bad prince so long as the mechanism of succession and the senate’s residual role could be invoked when the prince broke the compact.

I have not tried to force every president into a single emperor. The exercise is one of *pattern*, not identity. The crucial point, surely, is that both civilisations faced the same enduring questions: how is authority legitimated after a founding rupture? How does succession become routine rather than catastrophic? How does the system absorb the populist, the expansionist, the crisis steward, and the procedural violator without ceasing to be itself? The American answer has been constitutional fixity plus electoral alternation plus the occasional stretching of the executive under emergency—then the reassertion of limit (term limits, impeachment, resignation). The Roman answer was the Principate—republican form with monarchic substance—until the substance could no longer be disguised, and then the later empire’s sacral and administrative reinvention. Both traditions encode legitimacy and institutional continuity as the primary variables; both preserve the tension between the one and the many, the ruler and the rule. We shall see, perhaps, whether the American experiment can sustain that encoding as long as Rome did—or whether the grammar will shift again. Anyway, there we go.
