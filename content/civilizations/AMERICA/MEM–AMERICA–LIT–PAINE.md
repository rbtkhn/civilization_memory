I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves Thomas Paine as **America's founding mobilizer**:
the writer who, in Philadelphia (1776), lowered the **liability
threshold** for rupture—who made it thinkable and then morally
obligatory to reject Crown and Parliament by framing government as
a necessary evil and the cause of America as the cause of mankind.

From a liability perspective: Paine does not assign **jurisdiction**
to new institutions; he **delegitimizes** the old ones. **Who is on
the hook** for oppression? The King and the English constitution.
**Who is on the hook** for resistance? The reader—Paine puts the
burden of choice on the ordinary person and raises the moral cost of
*not* defecting. **Mechanism**: simplification—short sentences,
moral binaries, plain language—so that "every intelligent workingman"
could follow. That mechanism **reduces the cognitive cost** of
rebellion; it does not design the republic that follows. **Institutional
survival** of the Union and the Constitution is achieved by others
(Washington, Madison, the Convention); Paine's utility peaks before
independence and declines after—he is catalytic, not constitutive.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

II. COMMON SENSE — PHILADELPHIA, FEBRUARY 1776
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
*Common Sense* was published in Philadelphia weeks before the
Declaration. It did not draft a constitution; it **broke the frame**
in which reconciliation still seemed acceptable.

**Liability shift**: Paine names the King and Parliament as the
source of suffering—"the good people of this country are grievously
oppressed by the combination"—and asserts the people's "undoubted
privilege to inquire into the pretensions of both, and equally to
reject the usurpation of either." The **reader** is assigned moral
agency: to submit is to furnish the means of their own suffering.
**Defection incentive** is heightened by universalizing the cause.

SOURCE — Paine, *Common Sense* (1776) (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD):
> "The cause of America is in a great measure the cause of all mankind. Many circumstances hath, and will arise, which are not local, but universal, and through which the principles of all Lovers of Mankind are affected, and in the Event of which, their Affections are interested. The laying a Country desolate with Fire and Sword, declaring War against the natural rights of all Mankind, and extirpating the Defenders thereof from the Face of the Earth, is the Concern of every Man to whom Nature hath given the Power of feeling."
> — Thomas Paine, *Common Sense* (Philadelphia: W. & T. Bradford, 14 Feb. 1776); standard ed. (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD) [ERC-PRIMARY].

III. GOVERNMENT AS NECESSARY EVIL — DELEGITIMIZATION OF RESTRAINT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Paine separates society from government: society is produced by wants
and promotes happiness; government is produced by wickedness and
restrains vices. **Government "even in its best state is but a
necessary evil; in its worst state an intolerable one."** This
flattens procedural legitimacy—checks, balances, and precedent are
not virtues; they are at best the lesser evil. **Who bears liability**
when government fails? The people who "furnish the means by which
we suffer." The **mechanism** is psychological: once the reader
accepts that government is at best a necessary evil, the burden of
justification shifts to the Crown. Custom and habit are framed as
obstacles—"a long habit of not thinking a thing wrong, gives it a
superficial appearance of being right"—and "Time makes more converts
than reason."

SOURCE — Paine, *Common Sense* (1776) (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD):
> "Society in every state is a blessing, but government even in its best state is but a necessary evil; in its worst state an intolerable one; for when we suffer, or are exposed to the same miseries by a government, which we might expect in a country without government, our calamity is heightened by reflecting that we furnish the means by which we suffer."
> — Thomas Paine, *Common Sense* (Philadelphia, 14 Feb. 1776) (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD) [ERC-PRIMARY].

IV. THE AMERICAN CRISIS — MOBILIZATION DURING WAR
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
*The American Crisis* (first number, December 1776) was read to
Washington's troops. It does not allocate jurisdiction or design
institutions; it **sustains morale** at a moment when defection
(desertion, surrender) was a live option. **Who is on the hook** in
the opening line? "These are the times that try men's souls"—the
soldier and the citizen; the "summer soldier and the sunshine patriot"
may shrink; the reader is called to endurance. **Liability mechanism**:
Paine raises the reputational and moral cost of quitting. **Institutional
survival** of the Continental Army and the cause depends on exactly
this kind of emotional binding—Paine supplies the rhetoric; Washington
and the officers supply the structure.

SOURCE — Paine, *The American Crisis*, No. I (1776) (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD):
> "These are the times that try men's souls. The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of their country; but he that stands it now, deserves the love and thanks of man and woman."
> — Thomas Paine, *The American Crisis*, No. I (Dec. 1776), in *Writings of Thomas Paine*, ed. Moncure Daniel Conway (1894), or standard ed. (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD) [ERC-PRIMARY].

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. PAINE DOES NOT DESIGN INSTITUTIONS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Paine urges independence and endurance; he does not write the
Declaration, the Articles, or the Constitution. **Jurisdiction**—
who may do what in the new republic—is assigned by Madison, the
Convention, and the ratifiers. Paine's **exposure** is rhetorical:
he bears the liability of having accelerated rupture and lowered the
barrier to defection from Britain; he does not bear the liability of
governing. **Defection incentive** for the colonist is maximized by
his prose; **institutional survival** of the resulting republic
depends on others. The Federalist response (complexity, checks,
ambition countering ambition) is in part a **containment** of Painean
simplification—procedure reasserts itself after the mobilizer has
done his work.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Paine encodes **mobilization without institutional design**: the
voice that makes rupture thinkable and then obligatory, then steps
aside. America inherits his vocabulary—"necessary evil," "cause of
all mankind," "times that try men's souls"—and his **mechanism**
(simplification as weapon). It does not inherit his politics as
governance; the Constitution and the Court and Congress do that.
**Liability** for the founding rupture is distributed—Paine is one
actor among many; but his role is to **lower the cost of defection**
from Britain and to **raise the cost of inaction** for the reader.
That role is irreversible in memory; the language outlasts the man.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Paine delegitimizes Crown and Parliament; he does not assign new jurisdiction.
• Reader bears moral burden to resist; simplification lowers cognitive cost of rupture.
• Common Sense (Feb. 1776) precedes Declaration; American Crisis sustains morale in war.
• Paine is catalytic, not constitutive; procedure and Constitution are built by others.
• Federalist design partly contains Painean simplification; institutional survival is post-Paine.

Tension preserved without verdict.
