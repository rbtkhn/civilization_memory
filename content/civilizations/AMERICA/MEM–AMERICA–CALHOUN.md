I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves John C. Calhoun as **America's second-generation
defender of the South and state sovereignty**: the South Carolina
statesman who, with Clay and Webster, formed the "Great Triumvirate";
who advanced **nullification** (a state's right to void federal law);
and who, in his later years, argued that slavery was a "positive good"
and that the Union could not hold unless the North conceded Southern
claims. He died as the Compromise of 1850 was debated; his legacy
encoded the sectional logic that led to secession.

Calhoun does not invent Southern particularism.
He **theorises** it—nullification, concurrent majority, slavery's
defence—within the constitutional vocabulary, pressing the
state–nation ambiguity the founders left unresolved.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

H.W. Brands (*Heirs of the Founders* [2018]) places Calhoun as the
intellectual defender of the South and slavery in the triumvirate
(ARC-T-MODERN).

II. ORIGIN & RISE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Calhoun rose from South Carolina—Congress, War Secretary under
Monroe, Vice President under Adams and then Jackson. He broke with
Jackson over nullification and the tariff; by the 1830s he was the
Senate's most forceful voice for state sovereignty and Southern
interests. He framed the conflict as **liberty** (states and
slaveholders) versus **consolidation** (federal power and Northern
majority). His theory of the **concurrent majority** held that
fundamental interests (e.g. the South's) must not be overridden by
a numerical majority; otherwise the compact was broken.

**Structurally**, Calhoun's incentive was to preserve a Union in
which the South could veto what it saw as existential threats—tariff
or slavery restriction. When compromise could not secure that, his
logic pointed toward secession.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. NULLIFICATION AND SLAVERY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• **Nullification (1832–1833):** South Carolina declared the federal
  tariff null and void in the state. Calhoun had resigned the
  vice presidency; he defended nullification as a state's
  constitutional right. Jackson threatened force; Clay's
  Compromise Tariff defused the crisis. The underlying claim—state
  as ultimate arbiter of federal law—was not resolved.
• **Slavery as positive good:** In later Senate speeches and
  writings, Calhoun argued that slavery was beneficial for both
  races and that the Constitution protected it. He opposed
  compromise that would restrict slavery's expansion; by 1850 he
  was effectively cheering secessionist sentiment.

Calhoun thus encodes the **sectionalisation** of the founding
ambiguity: state vs nation, and slavery's place in the republic,
pressed to a point where procedure could no longer contain the
tension.

V. CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Calhoun encodes **state sovereignty and sectional defence** and the
**theorisation of slavery** within American constitutional language.

Lessons:
• The state–nation ambiguity in the Constitution could be pressed
  to nullification and secession; Calhoun gave it coherent form.
• Slavery could be defended as a positive good within the same
  frame that others used to limit it—procedure did not resolve
  the moral divide.
• The "heir" who spoke for the South left a legacy that fed
  secession when compromise failed.
