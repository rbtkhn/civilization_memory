I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves Philadelphia as **America's encoding of
procedural founding**: Penn's city (1682), religious tolerance and
planned growth, then **seat of Continental Congress**—coordination
of resistance, Declaration of Independence (1776), and
Constitutional Convention (1787)—where secession and federal
design are debated and adopted under one roof.

Philadelphia does not fight the war.
It **hosts the assemblies that authorise and frame it**; procedure
and text as civilizational output.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. FOUNDATION & TOLERANCE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
William Penn; Quaker settlement; 1682; religious tolerance and
grid plan; Pennsylvania as "holy experiment." Philadelphia grows
as port and commercial centre; diversity and print culture; colonial
capital and meeting place. **Neutral and central**—between New
England and the South; suitable as congress seat. Franklin's Albany Plan of Union (1754)
proposed that the first meeting of a continental Grand Council be
held in Philadelphia:

SOURCE — Franklin, Albany Plan (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD):
> "That within months after the passing such act, the house of representatives … may and shall choose members for the grand council … who shall meet for the first time at the city of Philadelphia in Pensylvania, being called by the President General as soon as conveniently may be after his appointment."
> — Benjamin Franklin, Albany Plan (July 1754), in *Papers of Benjamin Franklin* 5:399–417; The Founders' Constitution, 1:7:2 (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD) [ERC-PRIMARY].

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. CONTINENTAL CONGRESS & DECLARATION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
First Continental Congress (1774)—response to Coercive Acts;
grievance and coordination. Second Continental Congress (1775)—
after Lexington and Concord; Washington appointed commander; war
conducted from Philadelphia. July 4, 1776: **Declaration of
Independence**—adopted in Philadelphia; universalist register and
secession as stated right; alliance signal and legitimacy text.

*Common Sense* was published in Philadelphia (14 Feb. 1776), weeks
before the Declaration; Paine gave the rupture a universal frame:

SOURCE — Paine, *Common Sense* (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD):
> "The cause of America is in a great measure the cause of all mankind. Many circumstances hath, and will arise, which are not local, but universal, and through which the principles of all Lovers of Mankind are affected, and in the Event of which, their Affections are interested."
> — Thomas Paine, *Common Sense* (Philadelphia: W. & T. Bradford, 14 Feb. 1776) (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD) [ERC-PRIMARY].

Jefferson, in his Autobiography, on drafting the Declaration for the
committee and reporting it to Congress in Philadelphia:

SOURCE — Jefferson, Autobiography (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD):
> "The committee for drawing the declaration of Independence desired me to do it. It was accordingly done, and being approved by them, I reported it to the house on Friday the 28th of June when it was read and ordered to lie on the table."
> — Thomas Jefferson, Autobiography, in *The Works of Thomas Jefferson*, ed. Paul Leicester Ford, vol. 1 (New York: G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1904) (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD) [ERC-PRIMARY].

Philadelphia as **procedural centre**—where the break is declared
and the war authorised.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION (1787)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Post-war weakness (Articles of Confederation); convention called
to revise; instead, new frame drafted. Philadelphia again: **U.S.
Constitution**—federal structure, separation of powers, amendment
process. Ratification follows; Philadelphia encodes **founding
twice**: Declaration (exit) and Constitution (re-founding).

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Philadelphia encodes **procedure as founding**—assembly, declaration,
and constitution in one place; religious tolerance and political
centrality; text and institution as American output.

Lessons: Neutral ground for coordination; Declaration and Constitution
as dual founding moments; Quaker tolerance and federal design as
legacy.

Tocqueville, observing the republic that Philadelphia had helped found,
identified association as the condition for liberty under equality:

SOURCE — Tocqueville, *Democracy in America*, Vol. II (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD):
> "Among the laws that rule human societies there is one which seems to be more precise and clear than all others. If men are to remain civilized or to become so, the art of associating together must grow and improve in the same ratio in which the equality of conditions is increased."
> — Alexis de Tocqueville, *Democracy in America*, Vol. II (1840), ed. Mansfield and Winthrop (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2000) or equivalent (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD) [ERC-PRIMARY].
