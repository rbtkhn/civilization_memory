I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves William McKinley as **America's architect of
extra-hemispheric power**: the president who, through caution and
incrementalism—gold standard, Spanish–American War, Hawaii,
Philippines, Open Door, "fair trade," and the cultivation of
the British connection—transformed the United States from
continental power into **maritime and nodal** actor without
abandoning procedural form.

McKinley does not break the republic.
He **extends** it—overseas by war and annexation, framed by
declaration and treaty; at home by monetary and trade order and
by the management of public opinion. His successor (Theodore
Roosevelt) inherits the design; McKinley is the author.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

III. ORIGIN: CIVIL WAR, CONGRESS, OHIO
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
McKinley emerges from Civil War service, Congress (tariff
expertise), and the Ohio governorship—a **methodical** politician
rather than a charismatic one. His legitimacy is **administrative**
and **electoral**: two terms, Republican realignment, industrial
and financial interests aligned behind gold and expansion.

Robert W. Merry, in *President McKinley: Architect of the American
Century* (2017), frames McKinley's method as caution and incremental
mastery rather than grand vision:

SOURCE — Merry, *President McKinley* (ARC-T-MODERN):
> "cautious, methodical, a master of incrementalism"
> — Robert W. Merry, *President McKinley: Architect of the American Century* (New York: Simon & Schuster, 2017) (ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-SECONDARY]. Characterisation of McKinley's leadership style; page ref to be added from print copy.

IV. EXTRA-HEMISPHERIC TURN: WAR, NODES, OPEN DOOR
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
McKinley's presidency executes a **maritime and nodal** programme.

Sequence:
• Gold standard—monetary dispute settled; financial order
  consolidated
• Spanish–American War (1898)—Cuba, Maine, Congress declares
  war; naval superiority; Treaty of Paris: Cuba (indirect),
  Puerto Rico, Philippines, Guam
• Annexation of Hawaii—Pacific node; territory
• Open Door policy toward China—access without formal partition;
  commercial and diplomatic framing
• "Fair trade" and reciprocity—movement toward reciprocal
  liberalisation; British connection fostered
• Executive power and press management—public opinion shaped;
  legitimacy maintained through visibility and control of message

The **structural picture**: Spain weak; U.S. industrial and naval
capacity sufficient for expeditionary and naval war; Britain
accommodating (no coalition against U.S. expansion). Incentive
to secure Caribbean and Pacific nodes and to avoid European
alliance against America—hence Open Door and special relationship
with Britain. Force ratio and diplomatic context make extra-
hemispheric projection rational; McKinley's incrementalism
reduces political risk while locking in gains.

Mark Twain, in "To the Person Sitting in Darkness" (1901),
satirises the imperial rhetoric that framed such wars—"civilisation"
as cover for commercial and territorial gain:

SOURCE — Twain, "To the Person Sitting in Darkness" (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD):
> "Extending the Blessings of Civilization to our Brother who Sits in Darkness has been a good trade and has paid well, on the whole; and there is money in it yet, if carefully worked. Privately and confidentially, it is merely an outside cover, gay and pretty and attractive, displaying the special patterns of our Civilization which we reserve for Home Consumption, while inside the bale is the Actual Thing that the Customer Sitting in Darkness buys with his blood and tears and land and liberty."
> — Mark Twain, "To the Person Sitting in Darkness," *North American Review*, Feb. 1901 (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD) [ERC-PRIMARY].

McKinley's war is **framed** by declaration and **closed** by
treaty; expansion takes the form of civilised warfare and
procedure. The tension Twain names—liberation rhetoric vs.
acquisition—is preserved.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. SUCCESSION: ROOSEVELT AS HEIR
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
McKinley's assassination (1901) brings Theodore Roosevelt to
the presidency. TR amplifies—Roosevelt Corollary, Panama Canal,
bully pulpit—but the **design** is McKinley's: hemisphere and
Pacific as American sphere of management; naval and nodal power;
executive as steward of public opinion and policy.

Legitimacy continuity: the same procedural frame (Congress,
treaty, civilian control) carries the imperial turn. McKinley
encodes **architect**; TR encodes **energiser**. Both operate
within institutional form.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
McKinley encodes **extra-hemispheric expansion through procedure
and incrementalism**: maritime and nodal acquisition, gold and
trade order, Open Door and British alignment, and the use of
executive and press to manage legitimacy. The republic extends
overseas without abandoning declaration and treaty; moral tension
(liberation vs. colonial rule) is contained, not resolved.

Lessons:
• Incrementalism can lock in strategic gains while limiting
  political backlash; McKinley as methodical architect.
• Naval and expeditionary capacity enable extra-hemispheric
  projection; nodes and access over continental absorption.
• Liberation rhetoric and colonial governance coexist;
  procedure contains moral tension.
• Realignment (Republican dominance, industrial–financial
  coalition) follows from policy and war; McKinley and TR
  inaugurate four decades of that order.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• McKinley is the maritime corrective to Polk's continental
  expansion—same procedural form, different geography.
• Cautious, incremental; war and annexation as managed outcomes.
• TR inherits the design; McKinley is author, TR is amplifier.
• Gold, Open Door, Britain: financial and diplomatic order
  extended with expansion.

Tension preserved without verdict.
