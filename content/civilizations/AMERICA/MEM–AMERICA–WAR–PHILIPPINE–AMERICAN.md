I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves the **Philippine–American War** as America's
colonial war of pacification: the conflict that followed the
cession of the Philippines from Spain to the United States
(Treaty of Paris 1898), in which Filipino republicans under
Emilio Aguinaldo fought to prevent the substitution of American
for Spanish rule. The United States suppressed the First
Philippine Republic and established colonial governance—encoding
**liberation rhetoric (Spanish–American War) versus colonial
reality (occupation and counter-insurgency)**.

For America, the war is **colonial closure**: acquisition by
treaty followed by coercion; procedure (treaty, congressional
authorisation) and legitimacy (tutelage, civilisation) mask
the denial of independence. Moral tension is preserved.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

III. CONTEXT: FROM CESSION TO INSURRECTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The war follows directly from the Spanish–American War. Spain
cedes the Philippines to the United States in the Treaty of
Paris (1898). Filipino republicans had already proclaimed
independence and fought Spain; they expected sovereignty, not
a change of colonial power. McKinley's decision to retain the
islands—incremental, framed as tutelage and access—produces
armed resistance.

War is **justified** as order and civilisation; **experienced**
as colonial conquest. Procedure (treaty, Congress) legitimises
acquisition; counter-insurgency and civilian suffering expose
the gap between liberation rhetoric and colonial rule.

Mark Twain, in "To the Person Sitting in Darkness" (1901),
satirises the imperial framing that applied as much to the
Philippines as to the broader "civilising" project:

SOURCE — Twain, "To the Person Sitting in Darkness" (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD):
> "Extending the Blessings of Civilization to our Brother who Sits in Darkness has been a good trade and has paid well, on the whole; and there is money in it yet, if carefully worked. Privately and confidentially, it is merely an outside cover, gay and pretty and attractive, displaying the special patterns of our Civilization which we reserve for Home Consumption, while inside the bale is the Actual Thing that the Customer Sitting in Darkness buys with his blood and tears and land and liberty."
> — Mark Twain, "To the Person Sitting in Darkness," *North American Review*, Feb. 1901 (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD) [ERC-PRIMARY].

The Philippine–American War is the **inside of the bale**:
colonial control purchased with Filipino blood and liberty
denied.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. CONDUCT: CONVENTIONAL THEN GUERRILLA
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The conflict has two phases. **Conventional** (February–November
1899): U.S. forces defeat the republican army in set-piece
engagements; Manila and key towns secured. **Guerrilla**
(November 1899–1902): Filipino forces disperse; pacification
campaigns, reprisals, reconcentration, and disease produce
high civilian casualties. Aguinaldo captured March 1901;
Roosevelt declares the war ended July 4, 1902. Sporadic
resistance continues.

**Structurally**, U.S. superiority in firepower, logistics,
and naval support makes military victory inevitable; the
cost is legitimacy—anti-imperial dissent at home, colonial
governance abroad, and a lasting tension between American
self-understanding and imperial practice.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Philippine–American War encodes **colonial acquisition
through suppression**: treaty cession followed by war against
the local republic; procedure (Treaty of Paris) and rhetoric
(tutelage) do not resolve the moral tension between liberation
and empire.

Lessons:
• Acquisition by treaty can require pacification by force;
  cession does not imply consent of the population.
• Liberation rhetoric (Cuba, Spanish–American War) coexists
  with colonial rule (Philippines); legitimacy framing
  conditions domestic debate and historical memory.
• Counter-insurgency and civilian suffering become part of
  the cost of extra-hemispheric projection; the war prefigures
  later counter-insurgency dilemmas.
• Philippines remain a U.S. territory until 1946; MacArthur's
  return (1944–1945) and independence (Treaty of Manila) close
  the colonial chapter.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Spanish–American War acquires; Philippine–American War
  retains. Colonial closure by coercion.
• McKinley's incrementalism includes the choice to fight
  rather than withdraw; TR declares the war over.
• Liberation vs. colonial rule: tension preserved, not resolved.
• Pacific node secured; moral cost deferred; independence
  deferred to 1946.

Tension preserved without verdict.
