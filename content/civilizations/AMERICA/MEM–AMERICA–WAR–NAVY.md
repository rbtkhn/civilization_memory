I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves the **U.S. Navy** as America's **sea-power
institution**: the continuous naval force authorized by Congress,
subordinated to civilian authority, and deployed for blockade,
projection, and presence from the Continental Navy onward.

The Navy encodes **procedure and perimeter**: legitimacy of
maritime force derives from congressional provide-and-maintain
(Art. I, §8) and presidential direction. It is the instrument
that underwrote Monroe's declarative hemisphere, that enforced
Union blockade in the Civil War, and that projected American
power in the twentieth century without occupation of foreign
capitals by land armies.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. ORIGIN — CONTINENTAL NAVY TO CONSTITUTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Continental Navy was established by Congress (1775); it was
largely disbanded after independence. The Constitution gave
Congress the power to "provide and maintain a Navy" (Art. I, §8)—
**no two-year limit** unlike appropriations for armies—and the
President command as Commander in Chief. The U.S. Navy was
recreated in 1794 (Naval Act) in response to Barbary and
Atlantic threats.

Structural constraint: a navy maintained by law projects power
abroad while preserving the republic's preference for limited
standing land force. Sea power extends reach without the
domestic garrison logic that worried the framers.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. CIVILIAN CONTROL AND STRATEGIC FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Navy has remained under secretary-level and presidential
direction; no naval MacArthur moment dominates memory because
the tradition of compliance is entrenched. Its strategic
function has been **perimeter and projection**: blockade
(1812, Civil War), convoy (WWI, WWII), power projection
(Spanish–American War, Pacific 1941–1945), and presence
(Cold War, post–Cold War).

George Baer, in *One Hundred Years of Sea Power* (1994), on
the Navy's institutional continuity:

SOURCE — Baer, *One Hundred Years of Sea Power* (ARC-T-MODERN):
> "The United States Navy entered the twentieth century as a fleet designed to control the approaches to the American continent. It left the century as a navy designed to project power from the sea to the shore, to control the world's sea lanes, and to support the nation's political and economic interests abroad."
> — George W. Baer, *One Hundred Years of Sea Power: The U.S. Navy, 1890–1990* (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1994) (ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-SECONDARY].

The Navy is the primary instrument of **maritime control and
distant presence** when the republic commits to overseas
engagement; its legitimacy is conditional on civilian
authorization.

IV. KEY WARS AND ROLES
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• **Independence:** Continental Navy; privateers; French fleet
  decisive at Yorktown.
• **1812:** Single-ship duels (Constitution); blockade endured;
  no standing fleet parity with Britain.
• **Civil War:** Union blockade (Anaconda); riverine operations;
  Confederate commerce raiders; sea power denied the South
  foreign supply.
• **Spanish–American War:** Naval campaigns (Manila Bay,
  Santiago); projection beyond hemisphere.
• **Twentieth century:** Two world wars (convoy, Atlantic,
  Pacific); Cold War carrier presence; post–Cold War
  littoral and expeditionary roles.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• The Navy exists by legislative provide-and-maintain and
  executive command; same dual key as Army, different
  appropriations tradition.
• Maritime force extends perimeter without permanent
  land occupation; aligns with declarative restraint
  (Monroe) and offshore logic.
• Sea power has been the instrument of choice for
  sustained overseas presence and coalition operations.

Tension preserved without verdict.

VI. MEM CONNECTIONS (TYPED)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
DEPENDS_ON:
• MEM–AMERICA–LAW–CONSTITUTION — Art. I (provide and maintain
  Navy), Art. II (commander-in-chief); jurisdictional basis
  for Navy existence and employment.

ENABLES:
• MEM–AMERICA–WAR–AMERICAN–INDEPENDENCE — French fleet at
  Yorktown; Continental/privateer naval effort.
• MEM–AMERICA–WAR–1812 — Single-ship duels; blockade;
  coastal defense.
• MEM–AMERICA–WAR–AMERICAN–CIVIL — Union blockade;
  Anaconda; sea control.
• MEM–AMERICA–PRESIDENT–MONROE / MEM–AMERICA–MONROE–DOCTRINE —
  British navy underwrote Monroe's declaration; U.S. Navy
  later assumed projection role.

TEMPORAL_AFTER:
• MEM–AMERICA–WAR–AMERICAN–INDEPENDENCE–YORKTOWN — French
  naval presence; U.S. Navy's later independence from
  allied sea power.

PARALLELS:
• MEM–AMERICA–WAR–ARMY — Sister service; same constitutional
  footing; different domain (land); complementary force
  structure.

Cross-references denote lineage, not equivalence.
