I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves **William H. Seward** as America's expansionist
Secretary of State during and after the Civil War: the diplomat who
kept European powers from recognising or materially aiding the
Confederacy, secured the Russian sale of Alaska (1867), and pursued
territorial and commercial expansion as the **continuation of policy
by other means** once the Union was preserved.

It seems to me that the crucial point is that Seward's diplomacy
served two masters: **union survival** (no foreign recognition of
the Confederacy; no intervention; British and French restraint)
and **expansion** (Alaska, Caribbean and Pacific interests, the
transcontinental telegraph and trade). The question, really, is how
the same figure who had been an antislavery Republican and Lincoln's
rival-turned-partner used the State Department to lock in the outcome
of the war and to extend American perimeter. One has to understand
that Seward believed in an American destiny that was continental and
maritime—Manifest Destiny updated for the post-war moment—and that
the Alaska purchase was the most durable single transaction of his
tenure.

The fact is that the structural picture was clear: the Union had to
deny the Confederacy legitimacy and material support from Britain
and France; after the war, the U.S. had a vested interest in
removing Russian presence from North America (Alaska) and in
projecting commercial and strategic reach. Seward's diplomacy
delivered British and French non-recognition (and the resolution
of the *Trent* and *Alabama* crises without war), and the Alaska
purchase ("Seward's Folly" to critics, strategic and resource-rich
in hindsight). The name of the game was to secure the Union first,
then to expand the American sphere.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

II. CIVIL WAR DIPLOMACY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Seward's first task was to prevent European recognition of the
Confederacy. Britain and France considered mediation or recognition
at several junctures; Union victories (Antietam, Gettysburg, Vicksburg)
and Seward's firm diplomacy—and the Emancipation Proclamation's
reframing of the war as antislavery—reduced the likelihood that
London or Paris would break neutrality. The **Trent Affair** (1861):
U.S. seizure of Confederate envoys from a British ship; Seward
released them and defused the crisis, preserving British
non-intervention. The **Alabama** and other British-built Confederate
raiders caused lasting friction; Seward pressed for redress; the
Alabama Claims were settled after the war (1871–1872), with Britain
paying compensation. So Civil War diplomacy was **defensive**—keep
Europe out—and **legal**—hold Britain to neutrality and later to
account for damages.

Lincoln and Seward worked in tandem: Lincoln set policy and moral
frame; Seward executed diplomacy and sometimes tempered the
president's initial impulses (e.g. the Trent response). The
institutional continuity is that the State Department under Seward
served the war aim of union preservation and the postwar aim of
expansion.

III. ALASKA PURCHASE & EXPANSION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The purchase of Alaska from Russia (1867)—$7.2 million—was negotiated
by Seward and the Russian minister Stoeckl. Russia was willing to
sell: the territory was distant, costly to defend, and the Crimean
War had shown Russian vulnerability; the U.S. was a logical buyer.
Seward saw Alaska as strategic (Pacific access, future resources)
and as the removal of a European power from the continent. The Senate
ratified the treaty; the House appropriated the funds after some
resistance. "Seward's Folly" became, in the long run, a cornerstone
of American Pacific and Arctic presence.

Seward also pursued annexation of the Danish West Indies (Virgin
Islands)—not achieved until 1917—and favoured expansion in the
Caribbean and Pacific. His diplomacy thus encodes **expansion as
legitimacy**: the U.S. had a right and interest to extend its
perimeter; purchase and treaty were the preferred instruments.
The continuity with Manifest Destiny and with later hemispheric
and Pacific policy is clear.
