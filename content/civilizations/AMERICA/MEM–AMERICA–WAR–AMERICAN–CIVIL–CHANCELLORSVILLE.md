I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves Chancellorsville as America's encoding of
Confederate tactical peak and irreplaceable loss: the battle
(April 30–May 6, 1863) in which Lee, outnumbered, defeated Hooker's
Army of the Potomac through Jackson's flank march and shock, and in
which Jackson was mortally wounded by friendly fire (death May 10),
removing Lee's principal strike commander two months before
Gettysburg.

Chancellorsville is Lee's greatest tactical victory. It is also the
last victory before the loss that made Gettysburg possible without
Jackson.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

II. STRATEGIC CONTEXT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
By spring 1863 the Union has replaced Burnside with Hooker; the Army
of the Potomac crosses the Rappahannock and concentrates near
Chancellorsville. Lee divides his smaller force. Jackson marches
around the Union right, assaults the flank (May 2); Union XI Corps
routed; Hooker withdraws and is defeated. Confederate victory is
decisive but costly: Jackson, reconnoitring after dark, is shot by
Confederate pickets; arm amputated; he dies of pneumonia May 10,
1863.

The battle demonstrates Confederate capacity for high-risk
operational brilliance. It also demonstrates structural
vulnerability: one commander's death removes a capability the
Confederacy cannot replace. Lee invades Pennsylvania in June without
Jackson; Gettysburg (July 1863) follows.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. OPERATIONAL CHARACTER
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Key elements: Lee outnumbered; Army of Northern Virginia smaller
than Hooker's; Lee accepts division of force to achieve surprise.
Jackson's flank march: long march around Union right; attack in
late afternoon; collapse of Union flank. Hooker's defeat: defensive
collapse; Union retreat across Rappahannock; Confederate tactical
triumph. Jackson's wounding and death: friendly fire (May 2); death
May 10; Lee: "I have lost my right arm."

Chancellorsville encodes tactical brilliance and irreplaceability in
one event: victory and loss inseparable. The same operation that
wins the battle removes the man who executed it.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Chancellorsville encodes peak and cost: Confederate operational
genius and the inability to institutionalise or replace it.

Lessons: Tactical victory can coincide with strategic loss (death of
key commander); outcome and cost are not separable. Confederate
dependence on a few irreplaceable figures; Jackson's death
foreshadows Gettysburg and eventual exhaustion. Same geography and
command structure that produce Chancellorsville produce Gettysburg
two months later without Jackson, with different result.

AMERICA:
• MEM–AMERICA–WAR–AMERICAN–CIVIL — Parent war; eastern theatre;
  Chancellorsville as Confederate tactical peak.
• MEM–AMERICA–WAR–AMERICAN–CIVIL–LEE — Commander; greatest victory;
  lost my right arm; invasion of Pennsylvania follows.
• MEM–AMERICA–WAR–AMERICAN–CIVIL–STONEWALL–JACKSON — Flank march;
  mortal wounding by friendly fire; death May 10, 1863; Lee's
  principal strike arm removed.
• MEM–AMERICA–WAR–AMERICAN–CIVIL–GETTYSBURG — Chancellorsville
  precedes Gettysburg by two months; Lee invades without Jackson;
  Confederate offensive exhausted at Gettysburg.

Cross-Civilizational:
• MEM–ANGLIA–WAR–AMERICAN–CIVIL — Churchill: campaigns Richmond,
  Chancellorsville, Gettysburg; same battle, Anglian frame.
• MEM–ANGLIA–WAR–AMERICAN–CIVIL–GETTYSBURG — Chapter Chancellorsville
  and Gettysburg; sequential encoding.

VI. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Chancellorsville: Lee's greatest victory; Jackson's flank march;
friendly fire; death May 10; lost my right arm. Tactical peak and
irreplaceable loss in one battle; prelude to Gettysburg without
Jackson. Confederate brilliance and structural limit encoded
together.

Tension preserved without verdict.
