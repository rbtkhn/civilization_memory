I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves **Manifest Destiny** as America's ideological
frame for continental expansion: the belief that the United States
was allotted by Providence to overspread the continent and that
expansion was the natural, legitimate fulfilment of that destiny—
thereby justifying Texas annexation, Oregon, and the Mexican–
American War without framing them as mere conquest.

The phrase does not create expansion; it **legitimises** it. It
translates territorial ambition into a grammar of right and
inevitability—so that procedure (annexation, declaration, treaty)
and ideology align. Contradictions (slavery extension, Mexican
sovereignty, indigenous displacement) are deferred or reframed. The
ideology does not encode "don't expand" or "reverse course" as a
**legitimate** briefed option; ENTRY 0010/0011 (CIV–SCHOLAR–AMERICA)
would require that option set for operational expansion decisions.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

II. ORIGIN: O'SULLIVAN AND THE PHRASE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The phrase "manifest destiny" was coined in 1845 by John L.
O'Sullivan, editor of the *United States Magazine and Democratic
Review*, in the essay "Annexation"—written to advocate the
annexation of Texas and to resist European (British, French)
opposition.

O'Sullivan frames expansion as providential right and natural
flow, not aggression:

SOURCE — O'Sullivan, "Annexation" (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD):
> "Other nations have undertaken to intrude themselves … in a spirit of hostile interference against us, for the avowed object of thwarting our policy and hampering our power, limiting our greatness and checking the fulfillment of our manifest destiny to overspread the continent allotted by Providence for the free development of our yearly multiplying millions."
> — John L. O'Sullivan, "Annexation," *United States Magazine and Democratic Review*, vol. 17 (New York: 1845), 5–6 (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD) [ERC-PRIMARY].

On California, O'Sullivan predicts its "fall" from Mexico by
emigration and "natural" independence—expansion as the spontaneous
working of principles, not government contrivance:

SOURCE — O'Sullivan, "Annexation" (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD):
> "California will, probably, next fall away from the loose adhesion which, in such a country as Mexico, holds a remote province in a slight equivocal kind of dependence on the metropolis. … The Anglo-Saxon foot is already on its borders. Already the advance guard of the irresistible army of Anglo-Saxon emigration has begun to pour down upon it, armed with the plough and the rifle, and marking its trail with schools and colleges, courts and representative halls, mills and meeting-houses."
> — John L. O'Sullivan, "Annexation," *United States Magazine and Democratic Review*, vol. 17 (New York: 1845), 9–10 (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD) [ERC-PRIMARY].

The phrase quickly entered congressional and public debate;
Polk's presidency and the Mexican–American War were conducted
in its shadow. **Structurally**, the ideology lowered the
legitimacy cost of expansion—opposition could be cast as
thwarting destiny; conquest could be cast as fulfilment.

III. IDEOLOGICAL PRECEDENT: JEFFERSON
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Manifest Destiny had an ideological precedent in Jefferson's
territorial vision. Jefferson, in his annual message to Congress
(1803) on the Louisiana Purchase, framed western expansion as
security and the spread of freedom:

SOURCE — Jefferson, Annual Message to Congress (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD):
> "Whilst the property and sovereignty of the Mississippi and its waters secure an independent outlet for the produce of the Western states, and an uncontrolled navigation through their whole course, free from collision with other powers, the fertility of the country, its climate and extent, promise in due season important aids to our treasury, an ample provision for our posterity, and a wide spread for the blessings of freedom and equal laws."
> — Thomas Jefferson, Annual Message to Congress, 17 Oct. 1803, in *The Papers of Thomas Jefferson*, vol. 41, ed. Barbara B. Oberg (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2014) (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD) [ERC-PRIMARY].

O'Sullivan secularises and sharpens that vision into **destiny**—
continental scale as providential allotment, not merely policy.
The legitimacy grammar is continuous; the rhetoric is intensified.

H.W. Brands (*Dreams of El Dorado* [2019]) on the West and the pursuit of opportunity:

SOURCE — Brands, *Dreams of El Dorado* (ARC-T-MODERN):
> "Three themes characterized the American West in the 19th century: 1. The headlong pursuit of opportunity (the Dreams of El Dorado of the title). 2. Chronic violence (among whites, indigenous peoples, blacks and foreign immigrants in nearly all possible combinations). 3. Irony and paradox (the dreams often blew up in the faces of the dreamers; the individualism of the frontier was made possible by the collective largesse of the American public; the least populated region of the country was also the most urbanized; among other examples)."
> — H.W. Brands, Q&A re *Dreams of El Dorado: A History of the American West* (New York: Basic Books, 2019), Life and Letters (UT Austin), Oct. 2019 (ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-SECONDARY]. (Book p. to be verified when corresponding passage located.)

IV. AGENTS AND EXECUTION: JACKSON, POLK, WAR
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Manifest Destiny is **operationalised** by political agents.
Jackson's expansionist pressure and populist authority; Polk's
single-term programme (Texas, Oregon, war, treaty)—both act
within the frame. The Mexican–American War is declared and
won; Guadalupe Hidalgo transfers California and the Southwest.
Ideology and procedure align: declaration and treaty legitimate
what destiny had already claimed in rhetoric.

The **structural picture**: a weak Mexico, an accommodating
Britain on Oregon, and a U.S. capacity to project force made
continental closure feasible; Manifest Destiny reduced the
domestic legitimacy cost of pursuing it. Opposition (e.g.
Lincoln's in Congress) is framed as dissent from a national
narrative, not only from policy.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Manifest Destiny encodes **expansion as legitimacy**—territorial
ambition translated into a grammar of right, providence, and
inevitability. It does not replace procedure (Congress, treaty)
but **justifies** it; it allows conquest to be narrated as
fulfilment.

Lessons:
• Ideological frames lower the legitimacy cost of expansion;
  "destiny" reframes opposition as obstruction.
• The phrase emerges at the moment of continental closure
  (Texas, Oregon, war); it serves the political coalition
  that executes that closure.
• Jefferson supplies precedent; O'Sullivan names and sharpens
  it; Polk executes. Continuity from territorial vision to
  territorial war.
• Moral reckoning (slavery in new territory, Mexican and
  indigenous sovereignty) is deferred; ideology and procedure
  absorb tension until crisis (Civil War) forces reckoning.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Manifest Destiny is the ideological layer of continental
  expansion; procedure is the institutional layer.
• O'Sullivan coins the phrase; Jefferson supplies the precedent;
  Polk executes. Jackson presses from below.
• Expansion as "natural" and "providential" masks conquest;
  declaration and treaty formalise it.
• Downstream: Civil War over the territory expansion acquired;
  ideology does not resolve moral cost.

Tension preserved without verdict.

  Manifest Destiny.
• MEM–AMERICA–WAR–MEXICAN–AMERICAN — War justified within
  expansion frame; Manifest Destiny as ideological context;
  conquest absorbed by procedure.
• MEM–AMERICA–PRESIDENT–LINCOLN — Opposition to the Mexican–American War;
  dissent from expansion narrative; moral tension.
• MEM–AMERICA–PRESIDENT–MONROE — Hemisphere doctrine; no European
  colonisation; expansion within hemisphere; O'Sullivan's
  "balance of power" dismissal.
• MEM–AMERICA–WAR–AMERICAN–CIVIL — Slavery extension into
  territory acquired under expansion; deferred reckoning.
• MEM–AMERICA–REVOLUTION–DECLARATION–INDEPENDENCE — Universal
  rights language; Manifest Destiny as later territorial
  application of legitimating grammar.
• MEM–AMERICA–LAW–CONGRESS — Declaration of war; annexation
  and treaty; procedure that ideology justifies.
• MEM–AMERICA–GEO–COLORADO–RIVER — Southwest geography; territory
  acquired under expansion frame.

Cross-Civilizational:
• MEM–ANGLIA–WAR–MEXICAN–AMERICAN — Anglian encoding of same
  war; procedural republic turns expansionist; ideology as
  American frame.

Cross-references denote lineage, not equivalence.
