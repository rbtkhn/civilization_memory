# Executive Report: U.S. Foreign Policy Audit Against CIV–DOCTRINE–AMERICA

**Entity:** United States (STATE–AMERICA)  
**Activity:** Doctrine audit — current U.S. foreign policy assessed against American civilizational doctrines 01–07  
**Date:** 2026-02-12  
**Authority:** CIV–CORE–AMERICA v1.0 · CIV–DOCTRINE–AMERICA v1.0 · CIV–STATE–AMERICA v1.0  
**Classification:** Decision support; historically grounded pattern audit

## 1. Scope and Method

This report audits **current U.S. foreign policy** (as reflected in the 2025 National Security Strategy and administration posture) against the seven accepted American doctrines in CIV–DOCTRINE–AMERICA. Doctrines are derived from CIV–DOCTRINE–ANGLIA and adapted to American conditions: written constitutionalism, Western Hemisphere hegemon role, dual-ocean posture, and 1945/1991 structural inheritance.

**Sources used for current policy:**  
White House 2025 National Security Strategy (December 2025); public statements and policy characterisations. Editorial note: Official strategy documents are the primary authority for administration position (ARC–AMERICA ARC-T-INSTITUTIONAL). Where no direct quote is cited, the characterisation is inferred from published strategy and open reporting.

**Historical grounding:** MEM–AMERICA–MONROE (declarative perimeter, procedure before capacity); MEM–ANGLIA–WAR–AMERICAN–INDEPENDENCE–YORKTOWN / MEM–ANGLIA–CANADA (procedural exit, defeat without legitimacy collapse); CIV–STATE–AMERICA Section VII (Decision-Relevant History); MEM–RELEVANCE–AMERICA dimensions (hegemony maintenance, alliance/coalition, dual-ocean).

**Three perspectives applied:** legitimacy and institutional continuity; power distribution and structural constraint; leadership liability and mechanism. Tensions between perspectives are preserved; no single verdict is imposed.

---

## 2. Current Policy Posture (Summary)

The 2025 National Security Strategy frames U.S. interests in five vital areas: Western Hemisphere stability (migration, cartels, hostile presence); economic security (Indo-Pacific sea lanes, supply chains, critical minerals); European security (allies, “civilizational self-confidence”); Middle East dominance (denial of adversarial primacy, avoidance of prolonged war); technological superiority (AI, quantum, biotech). The approach emphasises geopolitical realism, conditional burden-sharing with allies, deterrence and supply-chain resilience versus China, and pragmatic arrangements focused on American prosperity over democratic promotion abroad.

## 3. Doctrine-by-Doctrine Audit

### Doctrine 01 — Procedure as Civilizational Memory

**Definition (Doctrine 01):** Authority in process and precedent; continuity survives defeat if procedure remains intact; Constitution and congressional process anchor legitimacy.

**Audit:**  
Current policy is framed through executive strategy documents and existing statutory and treaty structures. Alliance commitments (NATO, bilateral) and congressional appropriations and war-powers practice remain the procedural backbone of engagement. **Alignment:** Strategy is articulated within the existing procedural frame; no overt bypass of constitutional or legislative process is asserted. **Risk:** Conditioning alliances on burden-sharing and prioritising “American prosperity” can be read as procedural (renegotiation, reciprocity) or as a drift toward unilateralism if consultation and treaty adherence are weakened. Precedent: Monroe declared perimeter when U.S. capacity was embryonic; procedure and declaration preceded force (MEM–AMERICA–MONROE).

**Verdict:** **ALIGNED** — provided alliance recalibration and conditionality remain within treaty and legislative process. **Watch:** Any sustained pattern of bypassing Congress or alliance consultation would stress Doctrine 01.

---

### Doctrine 02 — Rupture Absorption Through Elite Replacement

**Definition (Doctrine 02):** Catastrophic rupture is survivable when it produces elite replacement and institutional repurposing rather than institutional annihilation.

**Audit:**  
Doctrine 02 applies primarily to post-rupture environments (e.g. Reconstruction, post-1945 Germany/Japan). Current policy does not centre on domestic or allied rupture absorption. **Alignment:** Not directly activated by present posture. **Relevance:** If major allies or partners underwent regime or elite change, the doctrine would counsel institutional continuity and hybridisation rather than erasure. No current violation.

**Verdict:** **N/A (dormant)** — no rupture scenario in scope.

---

### Doctrine 03 — Defeat Without Legitimacy Collapse

**Definition (Doctrine 03):** Defeat or retreat can be processed without legitimacy collapse when exit is procedurally managed; retrenchment is a strategic option.

**Audit:**  
The strategy’s emphasis on avoiding prolonged military engagements and on burden-sharing is consistent with preserving room for recalibration and exit. Framing retrenchment or prioritisation as strategic choice (rather than defeat) is doctrine-consistent. Historical precedent: British exit at Yorktown and Canadian autonomy were procedurally encoded; Vietnam was a violation of time/coalition logic (Doctrine 04/05) but exit was eventually processed through political and institutional channels (CIV–STATE–AMERICA Section VII). **Risk:** If recalibration or withdrawal from theatres is framed domestically or by allies as “retreat” or “abandonment” without procedural narrative, legitimacy stress rises.

**Verdict:** **ALIGNED** — strategy preserves procedural framing for exit and prioritisation. **Watch:** Domestic and allied narrative of “retreat” would stress Doctrine 03.

---

### Doctrine 04 — Time as a Strategic Weapon

**Definition (Doctrine 04):** Time converts to power through finance, institutional patience, and coalition endurance; outlast rather than overpower; delay favours fiscal and coalition durability.

**Audit:**  
The strategy stresses deterrence, supply-chain resilience, and avoiding unnecessary wars — consistent with playing for time and durability. Conditioning alliances on burden-sharing can strengthen coalition fiscal sustainability (allies invest more) or, if overdone, fracture coalitions and negate the time advantage. Cold War containment and NATO/Marshall Plan are the canonical applications (doctrine illustrations). **Risk:** Hard Constraints: “Coalition fracture nullifies delay”; “Fiscal collapse negates time advantage.” A policy that weakens coalition cohesion or domestic fiscal discipline without building alternative leverage would stress Doctrine 04.

**Verdict:** **PARTIALLY ALIGNED** — time and durability are emphasised; **risk** if conditionality on allies is perceived as abandonment and triggers defection. **Watch:** Coalition cohesion and fiscal sustainability.

---

### Doctrine 05 — Coalition Primacy Over Singular Victory

**Definition (Doctrine 05):** Legitimacy externalised through alliances and multilateral frameworks; allies absorb cost and share legitimacy; balance and alliance prioritised over unilateral dominance.

**Audit:**  
The 2025 strategy explicitly conditions alliances on greater burden-sharing and frames European and Indo-Pacific security in terms of allies. This is consistent with coalition primacy if the result is a more capable, shared order. **Tension:** If “conditioning” is read by partners as reduced U.S. commitment or as transactional withdrawal, legitimacy externalisation weakens and Doctrine 05 is stressed. Historical pattern: NATO and UN as legitimacy and burden-sharing frameworks (doctrine illustrations); Monroe relied on British naval underwriting (MEM–AMERICA–MONROE). The line between “stronger coalitions” and “weaker U.S. commitment” is perceptual and politically contested.

**Verdict:** **PARTIALLY ALIGNED** — coalition and burden-sharing are central; **risk** if partners interpret policy as unilateral retrenchment. **Watch:** Ally rhetoric and institutional commitment (NATO, Asian alliances).

---

### Doctrine 06 — Dual-Ocean Denial as Existential Defense

**Definition (Doctrine 06):** Atlantic and Pacific control are both necessary; sea control substitutes for land mass; invasion prevention outweighs battle victory; maritime dominance underwrite hemisphere and alliance security.

**Audit:**  
The strategy identifies freedom of Indo-Pacific sea lanes and economic security as vital; European security is explicitly supported. No retreat from dual-theater maritime posture is signalled. U.S. naval and alliance posture in both oceans remains the backbone of structural position (CIV–STATE–AMERICA Section III.B, VI-B). **Alignment:** Doctrine 06 is upheld. No current threat to maritime supremacy in either ocean is asserted in the strategy.

**Verdict:** **ALIGNED** — dual-ocean and alliance assurance remain central; no doctrinal stress.

---

### Doctrine 07 — Myth as Stabilizer, Not Engine

**Definition (Doctrine 07):** Myth stabilises institutions and morale; it does not generate power; narrative follows success and cannot substitute for procedure or capacity.

**Audit:**  
The 2025 strategy de-emphasises democracy promotion and “social priorities” in foreign engagement in favour of pragmatic, interest-based framing. That reduces reliance on myth as engine (e.g. “spreading democracy”) and aligns with Doctrine 07’s constraint that myth cannot substitute for procedure or capacity. **Risk:** Hard Constraint: “Myth collapses if contradicted by procedure.” If domestic or allied narrative continues to invoke “leader of the free world” or “rules-based order” while policy is perceived as purely transactional or retrenching, the gap between myth and procedure could accelerate legitimacy erosion.

**Verdict:** **ALIGNED** — reduced emphasis on ideological myth as driver; **watch** for narrative–procedure gap (myth vs. perceived conduct).

## 4. Summary Verdict Table

| Doctrine | Name | Verdict | Main risk / watch |
|----------|------|---------|-------------------|
| 01 | Procedure as Civilizational Memory | ALIGNED | Bypass of Congress or alliance procedure |
| 02 | Rupture Absorption Through Elite Replacement | N/A (dormant) | — |
| 03 | Defeat Without Legitimacy Collapse | ALIGNED | Narrative of “retreat” without procedural framing |
| 04 | Time as a Strategic Weapon | PARTIALLY ALIGNED | Coalition fracture; fiscal overstretch |
| 05 | Coalition Primacy | PARTIALLY ALIGNED | Ally perception of U.S. withdrawal or transactionalism |
| 06 | Dual-Ocean Denial | ALIGNED | — |
| 07 | Myth as Stabilizer, Not Engine | ALIGNED | Narrative–procedure gap |

**Overall:** Current U.S. foreign policy is **largely aligned** with CIV–DOCTRINE–AMERICA. The main tensions are **Doctrine 04 and 05**: conditionality on allies and burden-sharing can either strengthen coalition durability and time advantage (alignment) or trigger coalition fracture and legitimacy erosion (stress). The discriminating evidence is **partner and domestic perception**: whether recalibration is read as “stronger, fairer alliances” or “retreat and transactionalism.”

## 5. Findings and Recommendations

**Findings:**  
(1) Procedural frame (01), exit/recalibration frame (03), dual-ocean posture (06), and reduced myth-as-engine (07) are consistent with doctrine.  
(2) Time-as-weapon (04) and coalition primacy (05) are partially aligned; success depends on implementation and narrative.  
(3) No doctrine is currently violated; two are in the zone where implementation and narrative will determine alignment or stress.

**Recommendations:**  
- **For Doctrine 04/05:** Maintain clear, consistent signalling to allies that conditionality aims at stronger shared capability and burden-sharing, not exit. Monitor coalition cohesion and partner rhetoric.  
- **For Doctrine 01/03:** Preserve congressional and treaty-based process for any major commitment or withdrawal; frame any recalibration as procedural choice.  
- **For Doctrine 07:** Align public narrative with actual policy (pragmatic, interest-based) to avoid myth–procedure gap.

## 6. Mandatory Verdict Block (CORE Compliance)

Per CIV–CORE–AMERICA Section II (Legitimacy Accounting) and diagnostics:

| Diagnostic | Status | Note |
|------------|--------|------|
| Constitutional Adherence Index (CAI) | HIGH | No asserted bypass of constitutional process in foreign policy framing. |
| Electoral Legitimacy (EL) | INTACT | Policy produced under normal succession and institutional process. |
| Federal Coherence (FC) | HIGH | No state-level defection or nullification in scope. |
| Separation-of-Powers Integrity (SPI) | INTACT | Strategy is executive articulation within existing statutory/treaty frame. |
| Spatial Integrity | INTACT | No territorial or hemisphere integrity breach in scope. |

**Conflict rule (CORE):** EL and SPI override CAI; no breach of EL or SPI identified. This audit does not reassess internal legitimacy indicators (Section VI of STATE–AMERICA); it assesses foreign policy against doctrine only.
