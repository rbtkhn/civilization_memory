I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves the **U.S. Constitution** as America's **jurisdictional
anchor**: the text that allocates compulsory authority among branches
and levels of government and defines who may act in whose name.

From a liability perspective: the Constitution answers *who has
jurisdiction*—who may legitimately command, tax, judge, and make war.
It does not guarantee virtue; it **assigns and limits exposure**.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. ORIGIN CONDITIONS — PHILADELPHIA 1787
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Post–Articles of Confederation weakness: no power to tax, no executive,
no judiciary, no enforcement. The Convention was called to revise;
instead, a new frame was drafted. **Who was on the hook** for the
failure of the Articles? The states; the Convention shifted liability
to a federal structure while preserving state jurisdiction in reserved
spheres.

Madison's design assumes defection—ambition countering ambition.
Institutional survival is secured by **making no single actor
unilaterally decisive**.

The Convention is a **second** assembly-under-pressure moment after the
Continental Congress: not overrun, not contained—it produced the document
that backs procedure. Contrast: Congress = coordination + war (anchor);
Estates-General 1789 = reset; Duma/zemstvo = contained; Frankfurt 1848 =
overrun. See CIV–SCHOLAR–AMERICA ENTRY 0013.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. SEPARATION OF POWERS AS LIABILITY PARTITION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Constitution partitions **compulsory authority**:

• **Legislative** (Art. I): Congress—tax, declare war, make law. Exposure:
  collective; no single person can legislate.
• **Executive** (Art. II): President—execute law, command forces, appoint.
  Exposure: personal; the President is named.
• **Judicial** (Art. III): Courts—cases and controversies. Exposure:
  adjudicative; judges decide but do not execute.

No branch may complete the full cycle of coercion alone. Legislation
requires both chambers and presentment; execution requires law;
judgment requires a case. **Defection incentive** is reduced by
interdependence.

Madison, in Federalist 51, on why the interior structure must supply
the defect of better motives:

SOURCE — Madison, Federalist 51 (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD):
> "The defect must be supplied, by so contriving the interior structure of the government, as that its several constituent parts may, by their mutual relations, be the means of keeping each other in their proper places. … Ambition must be made to counteract ambition. … If men were angels, no government would be necessary. If angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal controls on government would be necessary. In framing a government which is to be administered by men over men, the great difficulty lies in this: You must first enable the government to control the governed; and in the next place, oblige it to control itself."
> — James Madison (Publius), *The Federalist* No. 51, 6 Feb. 1788, in *The Federalist*, ed. Jacob E. Cooke (Middletown, CT: Wesleyan University Press, 1961), 349 (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD) [ERC-PRIMARY].

Adams, in *Thoughts on Government* (1776), had already tied republican government to the execution of laws and an independent judiciary:

SOURCE — Adams, *Thoughts on Government* (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD):
> "The very definition of a Republic, is 'an Empire of Laws, and not of Men.' … The judicial power ought to be distinct from the legislative and executive, and independent upon both, that so it may be a check upon both, as both should be checks upon that."
> — John Adams, *Thoughts on Government* (1776), in *The Works of John Adams*, ed. Charles Francis Adams, vol. 4 (Boston: Little, Brown, 1851), 194–95, 210 (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD) [ERC-PRIMARY].

In the *Defence of the Constitutions* (1787–1788), Adams recapitulates: "The legislative, executive, and judicial powers are carefully separated from each other … and where all these circumstances take place, it is unnecessary to add, that the laws alone can govern" (*Works*, vol. 4, 587).

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. FEDERALISM — DUAL JURISDICTION
──────────────────────────────────────────────
Powers delegated to the United States; powers not delegated reserved
to the states (Amendment X). The text **divides jurisdiction** between
two levels. Who decides what? Enumerated federal powers vs. reserved
state powers. The boundary is contested by design—disputes go to
courts and politics, not to a single sovereign.

Structural constraint: neither level can abolish the other by mere
legislation. Amendment requires supermajority and ratification.
**Irreversibility** of the basic frame is high; change is procedurally
costly.

Tocqueville, observing the republic that this frame produced, described
the same division:

SOURCE — Tocqueville, *Democracy in America*, Vol. I (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD):
> "The sovereignty of the Union is an abstract thing which is connected with but few external objects. The sovereignty of the States is perceived by the senses, is understood without effort; every day it produces results which fall under every eye."
> — Alexis de Tocqueville, *Democracy in America*, Vol. I (1835), ed. Mansfield and Winthrop (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2000) or equivalent (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD) [ERC-PRIMARY].

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. PRIMARY TEXT — PREAMBLE AND VESTING
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Constitution's opening and vesting clauses state purpose and
allocation:

SOURCE — U.S. Constitution (1787), Preamble and Art. I § 1 (primary text):
> "We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America."
> "All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives."
> — U.S. Constitution, 1787 (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD) [ERC-PRIMARY].

Legitimacy is lodged in "We the People"; **operational authority** is
vested in institutions. The document does not vest power in a person
until Article II (President). Congress is named first—deliberation
before execution.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. AMENDMENT PROCESS — INSTITUTIONAL SURVIVAL
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Article V: amendments require two-thirds of each house (or convention)
and ratification by three-fourths of states. **No single branch can
amend the Constitution**. Survival of the frame depends on
supermajority across legislatures and states. The bar is high;
entrenchment is the design. Reversal of fundamental allocations
requires broad consensus—reducing the chance that one faction or
one moment captures the basic law.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Constitution encodes **procedure as legitimacy**: Anglian
suspicion of concentrated power translated into a written frame.
Washington, Madison, Jefferson—and the Convention—produce a document
that **limits who may act**, not one that guarantees outcomes.
Restraint is structural; liability is assigned; defection is
constrained by countervailing ambition. Franklin, on the Convention's
final day, modelled consent despite doubt:

SOURCE — Franklin, Constitutional Convention (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD):
> "I confess that there are several parts of this constitution which I do not at present approve, but I am not sure I shall never approve them. … It is therefore that the older I grow, the more apt I am to doubt my own judgment, and to pay more respect to the judgment of others. … Thus I consent, Sir, to this Constitution because I expect no better, and because I am not sure, that it is not the best. The opinions I have had of its errors, I sacrifice to the public good—I have never whispered a syllable of them abroad—Within these walls they were born, and here they shall die."
> — Benjamin Franklin, speech at the Constitutional Convention, 17 Sept 1787 (read by James Wilson), in *Records of the Federal Convention*, ed. Max Farrand (1911), or Teaching American History (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD) [ERC-PRIMARY].

VIII. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Constitution allocates jurisdiction; it does not guarantee virtue.
• Separation of powers partitions liability and defection incentive.
• Federalism divides compulsory authority between two levels.
• Amendment is costly; basic frame is entrenched.
• No single actor can amend or unilaterally suspend the structure.

Tension preserved without verdict.
