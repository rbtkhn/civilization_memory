I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves Daniel Webster as **America's second-generation
orator of the Union**: the Massachusetts statesman who, with Clay and
Calhoun, formed the "Great Triumvirate"; who spoke for the North and
its commercial interests; and whose 1830 Reply to Hayne in the Senate
became the classic defence of the Union against nullification—"Liberty
and Union, now and forever, one and inseparable." In his final years
he supported the Compromise of 1850, including a strengthened
fugitive slave law, and was accused of sacrificing liberty for union.

Webster does not invent Union doctrine.
He **articulates** it—constitutional nationalism, the people's
government, Union as indivisible—against Calhoun's state sovereignty.
His later compromise stance preserved the tension without resolving it.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

H.W. Brands (*Heirs of the Founders* [2018]) frames Webster as the
North's eloquent voice and the Union's defender in the triumvirate
(ARC-T-MODERN).

II. REPLY TO HAYNE (1830)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Senate debate nominally concerned western land sales; in substance
it was about slavery, federal power, and nullification. Robert Y. Hayne
of South Carolina had defended state sovereignty; Webster replied in
an extended speech (spanning days) that defended the Union and
rejected the right of a state to nullify federal law.

Webster framed the Constitution as the people's creation—answerable
to the people, not to the states as dissenting parties:

SOURCE — Webster, Reply to Hayne (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD):
> "It is, sir, the people's Constitution, the people's government, made for the people, made by the people, and answerable to the people. The people of the United States have declared that this Constitution shall be the supreme law."
> — Daniel Webster, Reply to Hayne, U.S. Senate, 26–27 January 1830 (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD) [ERC-PRIMARY]. (Standard editions: *The Works of Daniel Webster*, vol. 3; or *Congressional Globe* / debate records.)

He closed with the line that would outlast the rest:

SOURCE — Webster, Reply to Hayne (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD):
> "Liberty and Union, now and forever, one and inseparable."
> — Daniel Webster, Reply to Hayne, U.S. Senate, 27 January 1830 (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD) [ERC-PRIMARY].

Calhoun and South Carolina were wrong, Webster argued, to claim that
the federal government was infringing their liberty; the Union was
the condition of liberty, not its enemy.

III. LATER YEARS: COMPROMISE OF 1850
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Webster sought the presidency and never won. By 1850 he was willing
to support Clay's compromise—including a stronger Fugitive Slave Law
and the expansion of slavery into new territory—to preserve the Union.
His March 1850 speech in favour of the compromise chastised Northern
states for not returning fugitive slaves and dismissed abolitionists
as extremists. Critics said the man who had once advocated "Liberty
and Union" was now sacrificing liberty for union. The compromise bought
the country about ten years; then came war.

**Structurally**, Webster's incentive was to hold the Union together
through oratory and then through legislative support—even at the cost
of endorsing measures that extended slavery. The tension between his
1830 defence of Union and his 1850 embrace of the fugitive law encodes
the era's impossible trade-off.

V. CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Webster encodes **Union as oratorical and constitutional ideal** and
the **cost of preserving it**: later compromise with slavery and
fugitive rendition.

Lessons:
• Eloquence can crystallise a legitimacy claim—"Liberty and Union"
  as the North's answer to nullification.
• The same figure can later endorse measures that betray the
  liberty side of the formula; the Union-preserving incentive
  can override the liberty-preserving one.
• The "heir" who spoke for the North left a legacy of Union
  doctrine—and of the moral compromise that doctrine sometimes
  required.
