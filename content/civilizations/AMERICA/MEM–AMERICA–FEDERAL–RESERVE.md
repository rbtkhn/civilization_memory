I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves the **Federal Reserve System** as America's
**procedural replacement for private monetary authority**: the
institution created in 1913 to furnish an elastic currency, supervise
banking, and act as lender of last resort so that the republic need
not depend on a single man—as it had depended on J. P. Morgan in 1907.

From a legitimacy perspective, the Fed encodes **institutional
continuity over person**: Congress delegates monetary and supervisory
powers to a federal system (Board, Reserve Banks), not to a tycoon.
From a structural perspective, the Fed **concentrates** the power to
set interest rates and supply liquidity in one system, while
**dispersing** accountability across appointed officials and regional
banks—so that no one actor can be held to account the way Morgan was
in 1907. The tension between concentrated monetary power and
procedural legitimacy is preserved without synthesis.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

II. ORIGINS — PANIC OF 1907 AND THE ALDRICH FRAMEWORK
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Panic of 1907 exposed the absence of a public lender of last
resort. Morgan convened bankers, committed capital, and orchestrated
a private rescue. The episode demonstrated both that **private
authority could stabilise** and that such dependence was
**structurally unacceptable** to a republic that had already
destroyed the Second Bank (Jackson) and resisted a central bank for
decades.

Ron Chernow, in *The House of Morgan* (1990), on the panic and the
impetus for reform:

SOURCE — Chernow, *The House of Morgan* (ARC-T-MODERN):
> "The panic was blamed on many factors—tight money, Roosevelt's Gridiron Club speech attacking the 'malefactors of great wealth,' and excessive speculation in copper, mining, and railroad stocks. The immediate weakness arose from the recklessness of the trust companies."
> — Ron Chernow, *The House of Morgan: An American Banking Dynasty and the Rise of Modern Finance* (New York: Atlantic Monthly Press, 1990) (ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-SECONDARY].

H.W. Brands, in *American Colossus*, on the capitalist order that
preceded the Fed:

SOURCE — Brands, *American Colossus* (ARC-T-MODERN):
> "The capitalist revolution spun off personal fortunes for John D. Rockefeller, the titan of oil; Andrew Carnegie, the sultan of steel; J. P. Morgan, the master of money; and a hundred lesser winners in the capitalist struggle for profit and dominance."
> — H.W. Brands, *American Colossus: The Triumph of Capitalism, 1865–1900* (New York: Doubleday, 2010) (ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-SECONDARY].

The Aldrich Commission and a secret 1910 meeting on Jekyll Island,
Georgia—bankers and Treasury officials—produced the framework that
became the Federal Reserve Act. Congress passed the Act in 1913.
**Procedure institutionalised** what Morgan had done ad hoc.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. FEDERAL RESERVE ACT — PURPOSE AND STRUCTURE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Act states its purposes explicitly:

SOURCE — Federal Reserve Act (1913), Preamble (ARC-T-INSTITUTIONAL):
> "An Act To provide for the establishment of Federal reserve banks, to furnish an elastic currency, to afford means of rediscounting commercial paper, to establish a more effective supervision of banking in the United States, and for other purposes."
> — Federal Reserve Act, Pub. L. 63–43, 38 Stat. 251 (1913) (ARC-T-INSTITUTIONAL) [ERC-PRIMARY].

Structure: a **Federal Reserve Board** in Washington (appointed by
the President with Senate confirmation) and **twelve Federal Reserve
Banks** (regional, with mixed public–private governance). Member banks
hold stock in their Reserve Bank; the Board sets policy. The design
**deliberately avoided** a single central bank in one city—legitimacy
through regional dispersion and congressional mandate, not through
concentration in New York. Yet monetary power is **effectively
centralised** in the Board and the Federal Open Market Committee
(FOMC), which sets the federal funds rate and conducts open-market
operations.

G. Edward Griffin, in *The Creature from Jekyll Island* (1994), offers
a critical reading of the founding—elite design in private conference:

ARC–DISCOVERY: EXPANDED SEARCH
Source: G. Edward Griffin, *The Creature from Jekyll Island: A Second Look at the Federal Reserve* (1994)
Justification: Critical interpretive source on Fed founding and Jekyll Island; return-of-central-banking thesis; cited in MEM–AMERICA–PRESIDENT–JACKSON.

SOURCE — Griffin, *The Creature from Jekyll Island* (ERC-CRITICAL):
> "The men who met on Jekyll Island in 1910 represented the same kind of concentrated financial power that Jackson had denounced when he destroyed the Bank of the United States. They designed the Federal Reserve to serve private interests while appearing to serve the public. Jackson would have recognized the pattern—and would have opposed it."
> — G. Edward Griffin, *The Creature from Jekyll Island: A Second Look at the Federal Reserve* (Westlake Village, CA: American Media, 1994) [ERC-CRITICAL].

Mainstream historiography stresses congressional passage and the
Aldrich–Glass framework; either way, **central banking returned** after
Jackson's Bank War. The Fed is the **procedural** answer to the
question of who controls the money supply.

V. DEPRESSION, NEW DEAL, AND LATER ROLE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Fed's failure to act decisively as lender of last resort in the
early 1930s—and the bank runs that followed—shaped the next
procedural layer: FDIC (1933), Glass–Steagall, and expanded Fed
responsibility. Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., in *The Crisis of the Old
Order*, on the collapse of trust in business leadership:

SOURCE — Schlesinger Jr., *The Crisis of the Old Order* (ARC-T-MODERN):
> "For a season, prosperity seemed permanent, but the illusion came to an end when Wall Street crashed in October 1929. Public trust in the wisdom of business leadership crashed too."
> — Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., *The Crisis of the Old Order, 1919–1933*, in *The Age of Roosevelt* (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1957) (ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-SECONDARY].

The Fed was **present but insufficient** in the Depression; the New
Deal then **expanded** the federal role in banking and monetary
stability. Later, the Fed gained explicit dual mandate (maximum
employment, stable prices) and became the dominant lever of
countercyclical policy. Structural incentive: **avoid another 1907**
(no private rescuer) and **avoid another 1929–1933** (no effective
public rescuer). The institution survives as the procedural holder of
monetary sovereignty.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Federal Reserve encodes **procedure-over-person in monetary
authority**.

Lessons:
• Private lender of last resort (Morgan, 1907) is **replaced** by
  public institution (Fed, 1913); the republic does not depend on one
  man for liquidity.
• Central banking **returned** after Jackson's destruction of the
  Second Bank; the Fed is the compromise—regional structure, federal
  mandate, congressional origin.
• Legitimacy resides in **statute and appointment**, not in market
  dominance or personal authority; accountability is dispersed across
  Board, Banks, and Congress.
• Tension persists: concentrated **power** (one system sets rates)
  vs. **legitimacy** (procedure, not person).

VII. MEM CONNECTIONS (TYPED)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

DEPENDS_ON:
• MEM–AMERICA–MORGAN — Panic of 1907; private lender of last resort; Fed created so republic need not depend on one man.
• MEM–AMERICA–LAW–CONGRESS — Federal Reserve Act (1913); Congress delegates monetary and supervisory powers.
• MEM–AMERICA–GILDED–AGE — Concentration and panic; procedural response (ICC, antitrust, Fed).

ENABLES:
• MEM–AMERICA–GREAT–DEPRESSION — Fed as existing but insufficient stabiliser; contrast 1907 (Morgan) vs 1929 (Fed present, response contested).
• MEM–AMERICA–LAW–FEDERALISM — Fed as federal instrument; dual sovereignty (states, banks) and federal monetary authority.

CONTRADICTS:
• MEM–AMERICA–PRESIDENT–JACKSON — Jackson destroyed Second Bank; Fed is return of central-bank logic under new design; populist victory did not end central banking.

PARALLELS:
• MEM–ANGLIA–BANK–ENGLAND — Central bank as institutional stabiliser; BoE precedent; U.S. rejected then adopted central-bank form.

GEOGRAPHIC:
• MEM–AMERICA–GEO–ATLANTIC — Financial links to Europe; Fed as part of U.S. monetary and reserve role in Atlantic system.

TEMPORAL_BEFORE:
• MEM–AMERICA–PRESIDENT–JACKSON — Bank War; no national bank until Fed.
• MEM–AMERICA–MORGAN — 1907; impetus for Fed.
TEMPORAL_AFTER:
• MEM–AMERICA–GREAT–DEPRESSION — Fed in 1930s; expanded federal role.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VIII. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Fed = procedural replacement for Morgan; 1907 → 1913.
• Central banking returned after Jackson; legitimacy through statute and structure, not person.
• Jekyll Island (1910) and Aldrich–Glass (1913) encode elite design then congressional passage; tension preserved.
• Depression and New Deal expanded Fed context; dual mandate and FOMC later centralised power.
• Accountability dispersed (Board, Banks, Congress); power concentrated (one system, one rate).

Tension preserved without verdict.
