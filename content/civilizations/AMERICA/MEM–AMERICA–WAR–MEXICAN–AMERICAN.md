I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves the Mexican–American War as **America's
continental expansion war**: the conflict by which the United
States annexed Texas (dispute), provoked and won a short war
with Mexico, and acquired California and the Southwest (Treaty
of Guadalupe Hidalgo, 1848)—expansion framed procedurally
(congressional authorisation, treaty) while igniting sectional
and moral conflict (slavery extension).

For America, the war is **conquest absorbed by procedure**—
territorial gain without regime collapse; legitimacy through
law and treaty; moral reckoning deferred.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. CONTEXT: TEXAS, BORDER, MANIFEST DESTINY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The war emerges from expansion pressure and border dispute.

Context:
• Texas independence (1836); annexation (1845); Mexican refusal
  to recognise loss; border dispute (Nueces vs. Rio Grande)
• Manifest Destiny—continental expansion as ideological frame;
  Pacific access and western territory as objective (see MEM–AMERICA–REVOLUTION–MANIFEST–DESTINY)
• Polk presidency; provocation and incident; Congress declares
  war (1846); procedural initiation—civilian authority, declaration

War is **justified procedurally**—territorial dispute, invasion
of U.S. soil (claimed); Mexico weak, divided; America projects
force with institutional confidence.

Jefferson, in his annual message to Congress (1803) on the Louisiana
Purchase, had already framed Mississippi and western expansion as
security and "blessings of freedom and equal laws"—ideological
precedent for later continental expansion:

SOURCE — Jefferson, Annual Message to Congress (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD):
> "Whilst the property and sovereignty of the Mississippi and its waters secure an independent outlet for the produce of the Western states, and an uncontrolled navigation through their whole course, free from collision with other powers, the fertility of the country, its climate and extent, promise in due season important aids to our treasury, an ample provision for our posterity, and a wide spread for the blessings of freedom and equal laws."
> — Thomas Jefferson, Annual Message to Congress, 17 Oct. 1803, in *The Papers of Thomas Jefferson*, vol. 41, ed. Barbara B. Oberg (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2014) (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD) [ERC-PRIMARY].

John Keegan, in *A History of Warfare* (1993), on how institutions
restrain and channel violence:

SOURCE — Keegan, *A History of Warfare* (ARC-T-MODERN):
> "Our institutions and our laws, we tell ourselves, have set the human
> potentiality for violence about with such restraints that violence in
> everyday life will be punished as criminal by our laws, while its use
> by our institutions of state will take the particular form of
> 'civilised warfare.'"
> — John Keegan, *A History of Warfare* (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1993) (ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-SECONDARY].

The Mexican–American War is **declared** by Congress and **ended** by
treaty; violence is channelled through procedure, not outside it.

III. OPERATIONAL CONDUCT: RAPID VICTORY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Military success is swift and asymmetric.

Elements:
• Northern Mexico and California campaigns; amphibious and
  overland operations; professional officer corps (many
  later Civil War commanders)
• Mexico City occupied (1847); Mexican resistance insufficient
  to hold territory
• Decisive victory without total mobilisation; **system
  efficiency**—logistics, command, force ratio

Victory reflects **maturity of institutions**—war conducted
under civilian control, concluded by treaty. Expansion is
executed, not improvised.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. TREATY OF GUADALUPE HIDALGO & TERRITORIAL GAIN
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Settlement transfers vast territory.

Outcomes (1848):
• Mexico cedes California, Nevada, Utah, most of Arizona and
  New Mexico, and recognition of Texas to the Rio Grande
• U.S. pays compensation; treaty as **procedure**—cession
  formalised, not merely seized
• Pacific access secured; continental scale achieved; slavery
  extension into new territories becomes immediate political
  conflict

Expansion is **absorbed procedurally**—no military dictatorship,
no collapse of civil order; Congress and treaty ratify gain.
Moral and sectional contradiction (slavery in new territories)
is deferred, not resolved.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Mexican–American War encodes **expansion by force, legitimised
by procedure**.

Lessons:
• Territorial conquest can be framed legally—congressional
  declaration, treaty of cession; procedure authorises expansion.
• Weak neighbour (Mexico) and strong institutions enable rapid
  victory; force ratio and logistics decide.
• Expansion need not destabilise the republic immediately;
  procedure absorbs conquest; civil order and civilian control
  hold.
• Moral reckoning is deferred—slavery extension into new
  territories sharpens sectional conflict; Civil War as
  downstream consequence.
• Continental scale and Pacific access are secured in one
  war; America becomes transcontinental power.

The war is America's **expansion precedent**: conquest, treaty,
procedure, and deferred moral cost.

  republic turns expansionist); same war, different frame.

VII. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Procedure can authorise conquest; declaration and treaty
  legitimise expansion.
• Force ratio and institutional maturity enable rapid victory.
• Expansion absorbed; moral reckoning deferred; Civil War
  seeds planted.
• Continental and Pacific scope achieved in one conflict.
• Mexican–American War is expansion without regime rupture.

Tension preserved without verdict.
