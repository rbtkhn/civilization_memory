I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves **Hawaii annexation** as America's Pacific
nodal acquisition by coercion: the overthrow of the Hawaiian
Kingdom (1893) by a coalition of American and European sugar
interests with U.S. diplomatic and naval support, the
intermediate Republic of Hawaii, and the formal annexation
(1898) under McKinley during the Spanish–American War. Hawaii
becomes U.S. territory—a **strategic and coaling node**—without
the consent of the native sovereign or the majority of the
population.

For America, the annexation is **expansion by procedure over
sovereignty**: congressional resolution, not treaty with the
kingdom; legitimacy (strategic need, republican government)
masks the perpetuation of the 1893 overthrow. Contradictions
are preserved.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

III. CONTEXT: OVERTHROW (1893) AND ANNEXATION (1898)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Hawaiian Kingdom was overthrown on 17 January 1893 when the
Committee of Safety—American and European sugar planters and
businessmen—with the collusion of U.S. Minister John L. Stevens
and the presence of U.S. naval forces, forced Queen Liliuokalani
to yield. She yielded to the United States, not to the
Provisional Government, expecting arbitration. The Blount
Report (1893) later found unauthorised U.S. complicity. A
Republic of Hawaii was established; in 1898, during the
Spanish–American War, McKinley and Congress annexed Hawaii by
joint resolution (Newlands Resolution). Over half the native
population had signed petitions against annexation.

Queen Liliuokalani, in her protest to President McKinley (June
1897), condemns the proposed treaty of cession:

SOURCE — Liliuokalani to McKinley (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD):
> "I declare such a treaty to be an act of wrong toward the native and part-native people of Hawaii, an invasion of the rights of the ruling chiefs, in violation of international rights both toward my people and toward friendly nations with whom they have made treaties, the perpetuation of the fraud whereby the constitutional government was overthrown, and, finally, an act of gross injustice to me."
> — Liliuokalani to William McKinley, 17 June 1897, in *The Annexation of Hawaii: A Collection of Documents* (UHM Library Digital Collections) (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD) [ERC-PRIMARY].

The annexation proceeds anyway—by resolution, not the treaty
she protested. **Structurally**, Hawaii is a Pacific node (coaling,
naval, later air); the incentive for the United States is
strategic and economic; the legitimacy cost is absorbed by
procedure (Congress) and by framing (republican government,
security).

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Hawaii annexation encodes **expansion by overthrow and
resolution**: sovereignty terminated without consent of the
monarch or the majority; annexation during the Spanish–
American War locks in the Pacific node. McKinley completes
what the 1893 coup began.

Lessons:
• Territorial acquisition can proceed by congressional
  resolution from a successor regime (Republic), not by
  treaty with the deposed sovereign; procedure can bypass
  consent.
• Strategic and economic incentives (Pacific node, coaling,
  sugar) align with expansion; legitimacy framing (republic,
  security) contains dissent.
• Native opposition (petitions, Queen's protest) is
  recorded but does not block outcome; moral tension
  persists in civilizational memory.
• Hawaii becomes territory (1900), then state (1959);
  the overthrow and annexation remain contested.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• 1893 overthrow + 1898 annexation = one acquisition sequence;
  U.S. complicity then U.S. formalisation.
• McKinley annexes during Spanish–American War; Pacific node
  secured alongside Philippines, Guam.
• Liberation rhetoric (Cuba) does not apply here; Hawaii is
  nodal and strategic, not framed as liberation.
• Sovereignty and consent deferred; procedure and force
  ratio decide.

Tension preserved without verdict.
