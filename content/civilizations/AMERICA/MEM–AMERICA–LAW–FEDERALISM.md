I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves **federalism** as American law: the **division
of jurisdiction** between the federal government and the states—
who may do what, where the boundary lies, and who bears liability
when it is crossed.

From a liability perspective: federalism answers *which level has
compulsory authority* over a given subject. The federal government
has only **enumerated** powers; the states (and the people) retain
**reserved** powers. **Who is on the hook** when one level overreaches?
The acting level—its laws may be void; the other level or the
individual may resist. **Defection incentive**: states may nullify
or refuse to enforce federal law they deem ultra vires; the federal
government may preempt or impose conditions. The **Court** arbitrates
the boundary but cannot enforce its own rulings—**institutional
survival** of the division depends on political acceptance and
compliance.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. TEXTUAL ANCHORS — SUPREMACY AND RESERVATION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Two clauses fix the structure.

**Supremacy Clause (Art. VI cl. 2):** The Constitution, federal
laws made in pursuance of it, and treaties are "the supreme Law
of the Land"; state judges are bound thereby, "any Thing in the
Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding."
**Liability mechanism**: when federal and state law conflict, federal
law prevails—**within the scope of federal power**. The Clause does
not expand federal jurisdiction; it establishes **priority** when
federal jurisdiction is validly exercised.

**Tenth Amendment (1791):** "The powers not delegated to the United
States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are
reserved to the States respectively, or to the people." **Jurisdiction
ceiling**: the federal government has only what was delegated; the
rest stays with the states or the people. **Who bears the burden**
of showing federal authority? In practice, the party asserting
federal power; the Amendment is the **default** for residual
authority.

SOURCE — U.S. Constitution, Art. VI cl. 2 and Amendment X (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD):
> "This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof; and all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding."
> "The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people."
> — U.S. Constitution, Article VI cl. 2 (1787), Amendment X (1791) (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD) [ERC-PRIMARY].

Tocqueville, observing the compound republic a half-century after the
Constitution, captured how the division was experienced:

SOURCE — Tocqueville, *Democracy in America*, Vol. I (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD):
> "The sovereignty of the Union is an abstract thing which is connected with but few external objects. The sovereignty of the States is perceived by the senses, is understood without effort; every day it produces results which fall under every eye."
> — Alexis de Tocqueville, *Democracy in America*, Vol. I (1835), ed. Mansfield and Winthrop (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2000) or equivalent (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD) [ERC-PRIMARY].

III. ENUMERATED FEDERAL POWER — CEILING ON THE CENTRE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Congress may exercise only the powers listed in Article I § 8 (and
necessary and proper means). No general police power; no plenary
authority over domestic welfare unless tied to an enumerated head
(commerce, taxing, spending, etc.). **Liability**: a federal law
that cannot be justified under an enumerated power is **void**—the
Court may so hold; the state or individual may resist enforcement.
**Who is on the hook** for ultra vires federal action? The federal
government—its act has no legal effect in the federalist frame;
the state retains jurisdiction.

The boundary is **contestable**. Commerce Clause, Spending Clause,
and Fourteenth Amendment have been read broadly or narrowly at
different times. **Defection**: states that believe the federal
government has overreached may refuse to cooperate, litigate, or
seek amendment. **Institutional survival** of the states depends on
the Court and political culture respecting the ceiling; survival
of **federal primacy** in its sphere depends on Supremacy Clause
and enforcement.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. RESERVED STATE POWER — FLOOR UNDER THE STATES
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
States retain everything not given away. Classic reserved domains:
criminal law (except where federal interest is enumerated), family
law, property, tort, contract, education, health, elections (structure),
local government. **Jurisdiction**: the state has **compulsory
authority** in these areas unless the Constitution withdraws it
(e.g. Fourteenth Amendment limits state action that violates
rights). **Who is on the hook** when a state violates federal
constraints? The state—its law may be invalidated; officials may
be liable. The federal government may not **replace** state law
in reserved areas without an enumerated hook (e.g. conditional
spending, commerce, civil rights enforcement).

**Defection incentive**: states may innovate, experiment, or resist
federal policy within their sphere. They cannot nullify valid
federal law; they can refuse to go beyond what the Constitution
requires (e.g. no state duty to enforce federal regulatory
schemes absent clear mandate). **Irreversibility**: the states
cannot be abolished by Congress; the Constitution assumes their
existence. Elimination of the federal–state division would require
constitutional amendment.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. THE COURT AS ARBITER — ENFORCEMENT DEPENDENCE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Supreme Court expounds the boundary in cases and controversies.
It may hold federal law beyond enumerated power or state law
preempted or in violation of federal rights. **Liability mechanism**:
the Court's ruling allocates **which level wins** in the instant
case; it does not execute. **Who bears the cost** of defiance? The
losing party—but only if the executive enforces and the polity
acquiesces. **Defection**: states (e.g. Southern resistance to
*Brown*) or the federal executive may resist or slow compliance.
**Institutional survival** of the federalist boundary depends
on the Court's perceived legitimacy and on political acceptance
of its role as arbiter.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. HISTORICAL STRESS — NULLIFICATION, CIVIL WAR, EXPANSION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Federalism has been tested. Nullification crises (e.g. South
Carolina, tariff)—states claiming a right to suspend federal
law within their borders; the Union rejected the claim. Civil
War—secession as the ultimate state defection; the Union prevailed
by force; the federal–state division survived but with **federal
supremacy** over the permanence of the Union confirmed. Twentieth-
century expansion—New Deal, civil rights, conditional spending—
pushed federal power outward; the Court sometimes constrained,
sometimes acquiesced. **Who was on the hook** in each phase? The
level that overreached (or was deemed to have overreached) bore
the political and legal cost; the boundary shifted through
litigation, amendment, and practice.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Federalism encodes **dual jurisdiction as permanent structure**:
no single sovereign. The federal government cannot claim residual
power; the states cannot nullify valid federal law. The boundary
is **contestable by design**—courts and politics decide. Restraint
is structural; **liability** is assigned to the level that acts
outside its sphere. Institutional survival of the division depends
on both levels having an incentive to comply and on the Court's
role as expositor—a role that is itself conditional on acceptance.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VIII. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Federalism divides jurisdiction; enumerated (federal) vs reserved (states/people).
• Supremacy Clause: federal law prevails when within scope; Tenth Amendment: residual to states or people.
• Neither level can abolish the other by ordinary legislation; amendment required for structural change.
• Court arbitrates boundary; enforcement depends on compliance; defection (nullification, resistance) recurs.
• Institutional survival of the division is conditional on political acceptance of the boundary.

Tension preserved without verdict.
