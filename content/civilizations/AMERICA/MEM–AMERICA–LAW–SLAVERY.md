I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves **slavery as American law**—the allocation of
**jurisdiction** over enslaved persons, the **liability** of enslavers
and of the state that enforced it, and the **mechanism** by which
slavery was first embedded in the Constitution and then abolished
by amendment.

From a liability perspective: the Constitution did not create slavery
in the states but **recognised and protected it** in three places—
representation, trade, and fugitives. **Who had compulsory authority**
over an enslaved person? The master, under state law; the state, to
enforce property and status; the federal government, to return runaways.
**Who was on the hook** when the system was challenged? Congress (Fugitive
Slave Acts); the courts (*Dred Scott*); the President (enforcement).
After 1865, **who is on the hook** for holding a person in bondage?
The violator—and the Thirteenth Amendment gives the federal government
jurisdiction to punish and to prevent.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

II. CONSTITUTIONAL EMBEDDING — THREE CLAUSES
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The framers did not use the word "slavery"; they encoded it.

**Art. I § 2 cl. 3 (three-fifths):** Representation and direct taxes
apportioned by population, with "three fifths of all other Persons"
(counting the enslaved for representation, not as full persons for
rights). **Liability mechanism**: the slaveholding states gained
political weight in the House; the federal compact **rewarded** the
institution by giving it representation.

**Art. I § 9 cl. 1 (migration or importation):** Congress could not
prohibit "the Migration or Importation of such Persons as any of the
States now existing shall think proper to admit" before 1808. **Jurisdiction
denied** to Congress for twenty years—the federal government could not
abolish the trade until then; state choice preserved.

**Art. IV § 2 cl. 3 (fugitive slave):** "No Person held to Service or
Labour in one State, under the Laws thereof, escaping into another,
shall, in Consequence of any Law or Regulation therein, be discharged
from such Service or Labour, but shall be delivered up on Claim of the
Party to whom such Service or Labour may be due." **Federal obligation**:
the fugitive must be returned; the free state could not nullify the
claim. **Who bore the cost of defection?** The claimant (enslaver) if
a state refused; the Constitution assigned the duty to deliver.

SOURCE — U.S. Constitution, Art. IV § 2 cl. 3 (1787) (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD):
> "No Person held to Service or Labour in one State, under the Laws thereof, escaping into another, shall, in Consequence of any Law or Regulation therein, be discharged from such Service or Labour, but shall be delivered up on Claim of the Party to whom such Service or Labour may be due."
> — U.S. Constitution, Article IV § 2 cl. 3 (1787) (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD) [ERC-PRIMARY].

III. STATE JURISDICTION AND FEDERAL ENFORCEMENT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Slavery was **state law**—status and property defined by each state.
The federal government had **no general power** to abolish slavery
in the states; it had **enumerated touches**: representation, trade
window, and fugitive delivery. **Defection incentive**: a free state
could refuse to cooperate in returning runaways (personal liberty
laws, jury nullification); the enslaver then bore the cost of escape.
The Fugitive Slave Act (1793, strengthened 1850) **federalized**
enforcement—commissioners, penalties for non-compliance, minimal
process for the accused. **Who was on the hook** for enforcement?
Federal commissioners and citizens ordered to assist; refusal exposed
them to penalty. **Institutional survival** of slavery in the South
depended on federal willingness to enforce the fugitive clause and
on the political balance that blocked national abolition.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. DRED SCOTT AND JUDICIAL EXPOSURE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
*Dred Scott v. Sandford* (1857): the Court held that a Black person
whose ancestors were enslaved could not be a citizen under the
Constitution and that Congress could not prohibit slavery in the
territories. **Liability mechanism**: the Court extended **federal
protection** of slaveholding into the territories and denied
Congress jurisdiction to restrict it. **Who bore the cost?** The
claimant (Scott) and every person similarly situated; the political
branch (Congress) was told it had no power. **Defection**: Northern
refusal to accept the ruling; Lincoln and the Republican Party
rejected the Court's exposition. **Institutional survival** of
judicial supremacy was strained—the Court had claimed the last
word, and a large part of the polity rejected it.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. THIRTEENTH AMENDMENT — JURISDICTION FLIP
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
"Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment
for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall
exist within the United States, or any place subject to their
jurisdiction."

**Irreversibility**: no state may re-establish slavery; the federal
Constitution forbids it. **Jurisdiction**: the Amendment gives
Congress power to enforce by appropriate legislation. **Who is on
the hook** for holding a person in bondage? The violator—criminal
and civil liability; the federal government now has **compulsory
authority** to prevent and punish. **Institutional survival** of
abolition depends on the Amendment's entrenchment—reversal would
require another amendment (supermajority, ratification). The design
makes re-enslavement **constitutionally impossible** without
national consensus.

SOURCE — U.S. Constitution, Amendment XIII (1865) (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD):
> "Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction. Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation."
> — U.S. Constitution, Amendment XIII, ratified 6 Dec. 1865 (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD) [ERC-PRIMARY].

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. EMANCIPATION PROCLAMATION — WAR MEASURE, NOT REPEAL
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation (1 Jan. 1863) freed enslaved
persons in areas in rebellion **as a war measure**—commander-in-chief
power to weaken the enemy. It did not rely on a general federal
power to abolish slavery in the states; it relied on **military
necessity**. **Liability**: the Proclamation did not by itself create
criminal liability for holding persons in bondage in those areas;
it changed the **factual and military** situation. **Who was on the
hook** after the Proclamation? The Confederacy, as a matter of
military outcome; the Thirteenth Amendment later made abolition
**constitutional law** and assigned federal jurisdiction to enforce.
The Proclamation was **irreversible in practice** for those freed
as Union forces advanced; the Amendment made irreversibility **legal**.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
American slavery law encodes **jurisdiction and liability over
persons**: the Constitution allocated who could do what—states
defined status, the federal government protected representation and
fugitive delivery and could not ban the trade until 1808. **Defection**
—runaways, Northern refusal to enforce, Southern insistence on
federal complicity—drove the conflict. **Institutional survival** of
slavery required federal enforcement; survival of **abolition** required
a constitutional amendment that no single branch or state could
reverse. The Thirteenth Amendment is the **mechanism** that flips
exposure: the violator is on the hook; the federal government has
the jurisdiction to act.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VIII. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Constitution embedded slavery in three clauses; no single branch could abolish it in states.
• State jurisdiction over status; federal jurisdiction over representation, trade window, fugitives.
• Fugitive Slave Acts federalized enforcement; defection (Northern refusal) raised liability cost for South.
• Dred Scott extended federal protection of slavery; Court's authority rejected by large part of polity.
• Thirteenth Amendment: irreversibility; federal jurisdiction to enforce; violator on the hook.

Tension preserved without verdict.
