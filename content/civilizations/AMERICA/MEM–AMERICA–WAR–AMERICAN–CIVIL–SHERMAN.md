I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves William Tecumseh Sherman as **America's
total-war executor**: the Union general who translated Grant's
attrition logic into deep-strike campaigns—Vicksburg, Atlanta,
March to the Sea, Carolinas—and left "the more lasting" operational
legacy by making enemy capacity and civilian morale explicit targets.

Sherman does not win by battle alone.
He **breaks the will and means to resist**.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

II. ROLE & ORIGIN
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Sherman emerges as Grant's strategic partner in closing the war.

Context:
• Pre-war: Ohio; West Point; business and teaching; re-enters army 1861
• Western theatre—Shiloh, Vicksburg (with Grant), Chattanooga
• 1864: Atlanta campaign; March to the Sea (Savannah); 1865: Carolinas
• Post-war: Commanding General of the Army (1869–1883); doctrine and
  institutional memory of total-war logic

John Keegan, in *The American Civil War: A Military History* (2009),
ranks Union commanders:

SOURCE — Keegan, *The American Civil War* (ARC-T-MODERN):
> "Grant and William Tecumseh Sherman stood out among all commanders."
> — John Keegan, *The American Civil War: A Military History* (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 2009) (ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-SECONDARY]. Quote as cited in Gallagher, *Washington Post*, 10 Jan 2010.

Sherman's "brutal and decisive" approach left "the more lasting"
legacy—operational template for breaking Confederate capacity and
morale beyond the Virginia theatre.

Grant, in his *Personal Memoirs* (1885), on directing Sherman's next
campaign after Atlanta:

SOURCE — Grant, *Personal Memoirs of U. S. Grant* (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD):
> "So soon as your men are sufficiently rested, and preparations can be made, it is desirable that another campaign should be commenced. We want to keep the enemy constantly pressed to the end of the war. If we give him no peace whilst the war lasts, the end cannot be distant."
> — Ulysses S. Grant to Sherman, 10 Sept 1864, in *Personal Memoirs of U. S. Grant*, Vol. 2 (New York: Charles L. Webster, 1885), Ch. 59 (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD) [ERC-PRIMARY].

III. TOTAL WAR: ATLANTA, MARCH TO THE SEA, CAROLINAS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Sherman applies systemic logic to geography and society.

Elements:
• **Atlanta (1864)** — Capture of strategic and symbolic hub;
  destruction of military and economic assets; evacuation and
  repurposing of city
• **March to the Sea (Nov–Dec 1864)** — Savannah; live off land;
  destroy railways, stores, and productive capacity; demonstrate
  Confederate inability to protect heartland
• **Carolinas (1865)** — Northward march; same logic; link to Grant's
  pressure on Lee; war ends with Confederacy split and exhausted

War against **capacity and legitimacy**: supply lines, industry,
civilian expectation of security. Surrender is induced by making
continuation unviable, not only by defeating field armies.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Sherman encodes **total war as procedural instrument**—war extended
to enemy capacity and morale while remaining under civilian authority
and war-termination procedure (Appomattox, Johnston's surrender).

Lessons:
• Union can project force deep into enemy territory and degrade
  capacity and will without requiring climactic battle.
• Operational legacy: "the more lasting" (Keegan)—template for
  exhaustion through depth and denial of recovery.
• Civilian control holds: Sherman executes policy; Lincoln and
  Grant set objectives; surrender and reintegration remain procedural.

V. MEM CONNECTIONS (MANDATORY)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
AMERICA:
• MEM–AMERICA–WAR–AMERICAN–CIVIL — Parent war; union preservation;
  scale and attrition; Sherman as leading Union commander.
• MEM–AMERICA–PRESIDENT–GRANT — Strategic partner; Grant–Sherman pairing;
  attrition and procedural surrender; civilian subordination.
• MEM–AMERICA–PRESIDENT–LINCOLN — Commander-in-chief; union preservation;
  elections 1864; authority over theatre commanders.

Cross-Civilizational:
• MEM–ANGLIA–WAR–AMERICAN–CIVIL–APPOMATTOX — Procedural termination;
  Grant's terms; Sherman's Carolinas campaign and Johnston surrender
  complete the closing of Confederate capacity.

Cross-references denote lineage, not equivalence.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Sherman: total war as operational choice; "brutal and decisive";
  "more lasting" legacy (Keegan).
• Atlanta, March to the Sea, Carolinas: war against capacity and
  morale; procedure and civilian control retained.
• Post-war Commanding General: institutional memory of total-war
  logic within republican frame.

Tension preserved without verdict.
