I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves **Congress** (U.S. House and Senate under
Article I) as America's **legislative jurisdiction**: the only
body that may make federal law, levy federal taxes, and declare
war. No single person can do any of that—**liability is collective**.

From a liability perspective: Congress is the "first branch" in
the Constitution. It has the power of the purse and the power to
authorise war; the President executes and commands, but cannot
fund or declare war alone. **Who is on the hook** for law? The
institution—535 members, two chambers, majority (or supermajority)
required. Defection by one chamber or one faction is contained by
the other; no individual may legislate. **Institutional survival**
depends on the continued acceptance of bicameralism and presentment
as the only path to federal law.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. ARTICLE I — VESTING AND ENUMERATED POWERS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
"All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a
Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate
and House of Representatives."

Powers granted: tax, borrow, regulate commerce, naturalize, coin
money, establish post offices and roads, declare war, raise and
support armies and navy, call militia, exercise authority over
federal district and forts. **Jurisdiction is enumerated**—Congress
may do only what the Constitution lists (plus necessary and proper
means). The Tenth Amendment reinforces: powers not delegated are
reserved. Congress cannot claim plenary authority by silence.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. BICAMERALISM — DEFECTION CONSTRAINT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Two chambers: House (population-based, two-year terms) and Senate
(equal per state, six-year terms, originally chosen by state
legislatures). A bill must pass **both** in identical form, then
be presented to the President. **No single house can make law**.
The design forces compromise and slows impulse—ambition countering
ambition. Who bears liability for a bad law? The coalition that
passed it in both chambers and (unless overridden) the President
who signed it. **Personal liability** is diluted across many
members; no one person can be held to account for "Congress"
as an institution.

Madison, in Federalist 51, on why the legislature must be divided:

SOURCE — Madison, Federalist 51 (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD):
> "In republican government the legislative authority, necessarily, predominates. The remedy for this inconveniency is, to divide the legislature into different branches; and to render them by different modes of election, and different principles of action, as little connected with each other, as the nature of their common functions, and their common dependence on the society, will admit."
> — James Madison (Publius), *The Federalist* No. 51, 6 Feb. 1788, in *The Federalist*, ed. Jacob E. Cooke (Middletown, CT: Wesleyan University Press, 1961), 349 (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD) [ERC-PRIMARY].

Adams, in *Thoughts on Government* (1776), had argued that one assembly cannot hold all power and that a second body must mediate:

SOURCE — Adams, *Thoughts on Government* (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD):
> "A people cannot be long free, nor ever happy, whose government is one Assembly. … To avoid these dangers let a distant Assembly be constituted, as a mediator between the two extreme branches of the legislature, that which represents the people and that which is vested with the executive power."
> — John Adams, *Thoughts on Government* (1776), in *The Works of John Adams*, ed. Charles Francis Adams, vol. 4 (Boston: Little, Brown, 1851), 198, 200 (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD) [ERC-PRIMARY].

In the *Defence of the Constitutions* (1787–1788), Adams called American assemblies "the most adequate, proportional, and equitable representations of the people, that are known in the world" (*Works*, vol. 4, 581).

Tocqueville observed that federal power—the sphere in which Congress
acts—is experienced as abstract compared with the visible work of the
states:

SOURCE — Tocqueville, *Democracy in America*, Vol. I (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD):
> "The sovereignty of the Union is an abstract thing which is connected with but few external objects. The sovereignty of the States is perceived by the senses, is understood without effort; every day it produces results which fall under every eye."
> — Alexis de Tocqueville, *Democracy in America*, Vol. I (1835), ed. Mansfield and Winthrop (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2000) or equivalent (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD) [ERC-PRIMARY].

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. WAR AND PURSE — COMPULSORY AUTHORITY LIMITS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Congress declares war; Congress appropriates. The President is
Commander in Chief but **cannot fund the military or start a war**
without Congress. Structural constraint: the branch that decides
to fight is the branch that must vote the money and the declaration.
**Defection incentive** is asymmetric—presidents have used force
without declaration (e.g. Korea, Vietnam, post-9/11); Congress
has often acquiesced or retroactively authorised. The **text**
assigns jurisdiction to Congress; practice has blurred it. The
tension is preserved—Congress retains the power to withhold
appropriations and to repeal authorisations.

SOURCE — U.S. Constitution, Article I § 8 (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD):
> "The Congress shall have Power To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United States; but all Duties, Imposts and Excises shall be uniform throughout the United States; To declare War, grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal, and make Rules concerning Captures on Land and Water; To raise and support Armies, but no Appropriation of Money to that Use shall be for a longer Term than two Years; To provide and maintain a Navy; To make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces."
> — U.S. Constitution, Article I § 8 (1787) (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD) [ERC-PRIMARY].

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. IMPEACHMENT — CONGRESS AS ACCUSER
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
House impeaches (majority); Senate tries (two-thirds to convict).
Congress is the **only** body that may remove the President, judges,
or other federal officers for high crimes and misdemeanors. **Liability
mechanism**: the political branch holds the executive and judiciary
accountable through a quasi-criminal process. Personal exposure of
the accused is high—removal from office and disqualification. **Who
is on the hook** for abuse of power? The officer; Congress is the
tribunal. Defection (partisan acquittal) is possible; the design
makes removal difficult but not impossible.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Congress encodes **collective lawmaking**: no king, no single
legislator. Anglian parliamentary precedent is Americanized into
bicameral federalism—two houses, two constituencies, presentment
to the executive. Restraint is structural; **no one person can
make law or declare war**. Madison's design: ambition countering
ambition. Institutional survival of Congress depends on the
continued belief that law must come from this process—and on the
Court and President not absorbing legislative function.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Congress holds legislative jurisdiction; enumerated powers only.
• Bicameralism: no law without both chambers; defection contained.
• War and purse: declare war, appropriate; President cannot do either alone.
• Impeachment: Congress may remove President and officers; high bar (Senate 2/3).
• Liability is collective; no single member can legislate.

Tension preserved without verdict.
