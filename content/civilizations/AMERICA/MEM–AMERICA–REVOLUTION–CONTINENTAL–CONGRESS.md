I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves the **Continental Congress** (First and Second)
as the assembly that coordinated colonial resistance and then declared
independence—**without formal jurisdiction** from any sovereign until
after the Declaration. From a liability perspective: the Congress had
no power to tax, no power to compel the colonies, and no legal status
under British law except as a body of delegates. **Who was on the hook**
for its actions? The delegates (personally) and the colonies that sent
them; the Congress **requested** men and money and **recommended**
measures. **Defection incentive**: any colony could recall its delegates
or refuse to comply; the Congress held only so long as the colonies
chose to participate. **Institutional survival** of the Congress
depended on continued participation and on the war being fought—after
the Articles of Confederation (1781), the Congress became the Confederation
Congress with slightly more formal status, but still no power to enforce.

**Encoding (assembly-under-pressure):** In the fourfold typology (anchor /
reset / contained / overrun), the Continental Congress is the **anchor**
type: procedure plus war and state compliance (Olive Branch, Washington,
Declaration). Contrast: Estates-General 1789 = reset; Russian Duma/zemstvo
= contained; Frankfurt 1848 = overrun. See CIV–SCHOLAR–AMERICA ENTRY 0013,
SYNTHESIS 0006.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

II. FIRST CONTINENTAL CONGRESS (1774)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Convened in Philadelphia in response to the Coercive Acts (Intolerable
Acts); twelve colonies sent delegates (Georgia absent). **Jurisdiction**:
none from Crown or Parliament; the Congress was a **voluntary**
coordination of colonial assemblies and conventions. It adopted a
Declaration of Rights and Grievances, endorsed non-importation and
non-exportation, and agreed to meet again if grievances were not
redressed. **Liability**: delegates acted at the pleasure of their
colonies; the Crown could have treated the Congress as seditious.
**Institutional survival** was provisional—the Congress adjourned
without claiming sovereignty.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. SECOND CONTINENTAL CONGRESS (1775–1781)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Met after Lexington and Concord (April 1775). **Actions**: adopted
the Continental Army; appointed Washington commander-in-chief (June 1775);
authorized war measures; sent the Olive Branch Petition (July 1775);
adopted the Declaration of Independence (July 1776). **Jurisdiction**:
before the Declaration, the Congress still petitioned the King—it
claimed to act as loyal subjects seeking redress. After the Declaration,
the Congress became the de facto central authority for the "United
States," but it had **no power to tax or compel**; it relied on
state compliance. **Who was on the hook?** The delegates who voted
for independence (treason); the states that funded and manned the
army; Washington, who executed Congress's military authority.

Churchill, on the Congress meeting in Philadelphia (May 1775):

SOURCE — Churchill, *The Age of Revolution* (Vol. 3) (ARC-T-MODERN):
> "In May 1775 a congress of delegates from the American colonies met in the Carpenters' Hall of the quiet Pennsylvanian town of Philadelphia. They were respectable lawyers, doctors, merchants, and landowners, nervous at the onrush of events."
> — Winston S. Churchill, *A History of the English-Speaking Peoples*, Vol. 3, *The Age of Revolution* (1956–1958), ch. 13 "The War of Independence" (ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-SECONDARY].

*Common Sense* (Feb. 1776) was published in Philadelphia while the
Second Congress was the de facto coordinating body; Paine universalized
the cause:

SOURCE — Paine, *Common Sense* (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD):
> "The cause of America is in a great measure the cause of all mankind. Many circumstances hath, and will arise, which are not local, but universal, and through which the principles of all Lovers of Mankind are affected."
> — Thomas Paine, *Common Sense* (Philadelphia: W. & T. Bradford, 14 Feb. 1776) (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD) [ERC-PRIMARY].

Franklin, who had argued at Albany (1754) that colonial union was
necessary for preservation, sat in the Congress that was now
attempting that coordination:

SOURCE — Franklin, Albany Plan (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD):
> "That an union of the colonies is absolutely necessary for their preservation."
> — Benjamin Franklin, "Reasons and Motives for the Albany Plan of Union," July 1754, in *Papers of Benjamin Franklin* 5:399–417 (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD) [ERC-PRIMARY].

IV. OLIVE BRANCH AND RUPTURE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
In July 1775 the Congress sent the Olive Branch Petition to the King—
still using procedural, loyal language: "We therefore beseech your
Majesty, that your royal authority and influence may be graciously
interposed to procure us relief from our afflicting fears and jealousies."
**Liability mechanism**: the petition **delayed** the full allocation
of treason—the Congress could claim it had sought peace. When the
King refused and declared the colonies in rebellion, the **defection**
was mutual; the Declaration (1776) then made the break public and
irrevocable. **Who bore the cost** of the petition's failure? The
Congress and the colonies—they had tried procedure; procedure had
failed; rupture followed.

SOURCE — Olive Branch Petition, Second Continental Congress (July 1775) (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD):
> "We therefore beseech your Majesty, that your royal authority and influence may be graciously interposed to procure us relief from our afflicting fears and jealousies, occasioned by the system before-mentioned, and to settle peace through every part of your dominions."
> — Olive Branch Petition, Second Continental Congress, 8 July 1775 (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD) [ERC-PRIMARY].

Burke had already framed the choice in Parliament (March 1775) as peace
by concession, not force—a path Parliament did not take:

SOURCE — Burke, Speech on Conciliation with the Colonies (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD):
> "The proposition is peace. Not peace through the medium of war; not peace to be hunted through the labyrinth of intricate and endless negotiations; not peace to arise out of universal discord fomented, from principle, in all parts of the Empire … It is simple peace; sought in its natural course, and in its ordinary haunts. It is peace sought in the spirit of peace, and laid in principles purely pacific."
> — Edmund Burke, Speech on Moving His Resolutions for Conciliation with the Colonies, House of Commons, 22 March 1775; *Works* (Bohn 1854–56), 1:464–71 (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD) [ERC-PRIMARY].

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. CONGRESS AND WASHINGTON — AUTHORITY WITHOUT ENFORCEMENT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Congress appointed Washington but could not pay or supply the army
except by **requesting** the states. **Jurisdiction**: Congress had
**authority** (de facto) to direct the war and to treat with foreign
powers (e.g. French alliance); it had **no enforcement mechanism**
against a state that refused to contribute. **Defection**: states
underfunded or delayed; Washington and the army endured. **Institutional
survival** of the Congress depended on the states' continued willingness
to send delegates and to comply—and on victory, which would legitimize
the body that had coordinated the war. The Articles of Confederation
(1781) gave the Congress a written basis but still no power to tax
or compel; the Constitution (1787) replaced it with a federal government
that had enumerated powers.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Continental Congress encodes **coordination without sovereignty**:
an assembly that invents itself as the voice of the colonies, petitions
then declares, and directs a war without the power to enforce. **Liability**
is distributed—delegates, states, commander—and **institutional
survival** is conditional on participation and victory. The Congress
is the **mechanism** by which the Revolution is coordinated; it is
not the mechanism by which the postwar republic is governed. That
requires the Constitution and the new Congress under Article I.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Continental Congress had no formal jurisdiction from Crown; voluntary assembly.
• First Congress (1774): grievance and boycott; Second (1775–1781): army, Declaration, war.
• Olive Branch Petition (1775): procedural language; failure made rupture thinkable.
• Congress could not tax or compel; relied on state compliance; Washington executed military authority.
• Articles (1781) gave written basis; Constitution (1787) replaced Congress with federal government.

Tension preserved without verdict.
