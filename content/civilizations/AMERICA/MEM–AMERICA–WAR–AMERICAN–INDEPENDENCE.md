I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves the War of American Independence as **America's
founding war and procedural secession**: the conflict by which
thirteen British North American colonies broke imperial sovereignty
while retaining Anglian procedural grammar—common law, representation,
restraint—and secured recognition through military endurance, French
alliance, and decisive victory at Yorktown (1781), then Treaty of Paris (1783).

For America, the war is **institutional birth through armed exit**—
secession encoded as continuity of form, not revolution against form.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. STRATEGIC ENTRY: GRIEVANCE & LEGITIMACY FRAME
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The colonies enter conflict as procedural claimants, not ideological
rebels.

Context:
• Post–Seven Years' War imperial strain; taxation and representation
  disputes; rights framed as inherited (English liberty), not invented
• Continental Congress (1774–1775); coordination without central
  sovereignty; legitimacy through assembly and grievance
• Declaration of Independence (1776)—universalist register and alliance
  signal; secession as stated right; war as defence of procedure
  against imperial overreach

The war is fought over **who governs and by what right**—not over
rejection of law or representation. America claims continuity of
Anglian grammar against Crown and Parliament.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. WASHINGTON & CONTINENTAL ENDURANCE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Continental Army and militia sustain the conflict.

Elements:
• George Washington as commander—restraint, preservation of force,
  deference to civilian authority (Congress); legitimacy of command
  derived from consent and endurance
• Asymmetric war—avoidance of decisive British victory; force
  preservation; logistics and morale over pitched battle
• Valley Forge (1777–1778); institutionalisation of army; French
  alliance (1778) alters strategic balance

Victory is framed as **survival and alliance**, not annihilation
of the enemy. The republic-in-formation outlasts imperial will.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. FRENCH ALLIANCE AS SYSTEMIC SHIFT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
French entry (1778) transforms war geometry.

Effects:
• Naval parity against Britain; globalisation of conflict
• Yorktown (1781)—French fleet blocks British relief; Washington
  and Rochambeau force Cornwallis's surrender; decisive nodal
  victory
• Alliance as **strategic necessity**—America secures independence
  with external power; procedure (treaty, coordination) extends
  to great-power partnership

The war ceases to be colonial rebellion and becomes **imperial
contest**; American independence is sealed when Britain cannot
hold the theatre.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. YORKTOWN & TERMINATION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Yorktown forces British strategic reassessment.

Sequence:
• Siege of Yorktown (September–October 1781); Cornwallis surrenders
• British political will collapses; North falls; negotiations begin
• Treaty of Paris (1783)—independence recognised; territory defined;
  procedural exit by Britain without homeland invasion
• America encodes **victory through coalition and endurance**—
  institutional birth recognised by the former sovereign

Termination is **diplomatic and procedural**; no revolutionary
purge of the defeated. Britain exits; America continues under
inherited grammar.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The War of American Independence encodes **procedural secession and
founding through alliance**.

Lessons:
• Secession from empire can be framed as continuity of rights and
  procedure—rebellion against overreach, not against form.
• Endurance and alliance can substitute for overwhelming force;
  French entry as systemic shift; Yorktown as nodal victory.
• Civilian control and restraint (Washington) legitimate military
  command; the general serves the Congress and returns power.
• Treaty of Paris encodes **recognition**—independence granted by
  the former sovereign; procedure survives the break.
• America is born from Anglian grammar externalised; the war is
  founding, not civilizational rupture.

The war is America's **institutional origin**: armed exit, French
alliance, Yorktown, and Treaty of Paris.

VII. MEM CONNECTIONS (MANDATORY)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
AMERICA:
• MEM–AMERICA–WAR–SEVEN–YEARS — Colonial phase; postwar imperial
  strain; prelude to independence; same generation, second war.
• MEM–AMERICA–WASHINGTON — Commander; restraint; deference to
  civilian authority; voluntary return of power; founding general.
• MEM–AMERICA–ADAMS — Diplomat; Treaty of Paris negotiator;
  first generation.
• MEM–AMERICA–JEFFERSON — Declaration of Independence; legitimacy
  and alliance signal; republican vision.
• MEM–AMERICA–MADISON — Constitutional design post-independence;
  federal structure after war.
• MEM–AMERICA–LINCOLN — Later crisis of union; Civil War as
  inverse (preserve union vs. secure exit).

Cross-Civilizational:
• MEM–ANGLIA–WAR–AMERICAN–INDEPENDENCE — British perspective;
  managed defeat; procedural exit; same war, different encoding.
• MEM–ANGLIA–WAR–AMERICAN–INDEPENDENCE–YORKTOWN — British defeat
  at Yorktown; America's decisive victory; nodal termination.
• MEM–ANGLIA–DECLARATION–INDEPENDENCE — Legitimacy claim;
  secession as institutional continuity (if filed under ANGLIA).

Cross-references denote lineage, not equivalence.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VIII. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Procedural secession: break allegiance, retain form.
• Alliance (France) as force multiplier; victory through coalition.
• Yorktown as nodal decisive victory; Treaty of Paris as recognition.
• Washington: restraint, civilian control, return of power—founding precedent.
• America born from Anglian grammar; war as founding, not rupture.

Tension preserved without verdict.
