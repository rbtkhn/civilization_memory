I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves the War of American Independence as **America's
founding war and procedural secession**: the conflict by which
thirteen British North American colonies broke imperial sovereignty
while retaining Anglian procedural grammar—common law, representation,
restraint—and secured recognition through military endurance, French
alliance, and decisive victory at Yorktown (1781), then Treaty of Paris (1783).

For America, the war is **institutional birth through armed exit**—
secession encoded as continuity of form, not revolution against form.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. STRATEGIC ENTRY: GRIEVANCE & LEGITIMACY FRAME
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The colonies enter conflict as procedural claimants, not ideological
rebels.

Context:
• Post–Seven Years' War imperial strain; taxation and representation
  disputes; rights framed as inherited (English liberty), not invented
• Continental Congress (1774–1775); coordination without central
  sovereignty; legitimacy through assembly and grievance
• Declaration of Independence (1776)—universalist register and alliance
  signal; secession as stated right; war as defence of procedure
  against imperial overreach

Burke, in the same Parliament that rejected conciliation (March 1775),
had already described the colonists in terms that match that self-understanding:

SOURCE — Burke, Speech on Conciliation with the Colonies (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD):
> "In this character of the Americans, a love of freedom is the predominating feature which marks and distinguishes the whole … This fierce spirit of liberty is stronger in the English colonies probably than in any other people of the earth … They are therefore not only devoted to liberty, but to liberty according to English ideas, and on English principles."
> — Edmund Burke, Speech on Conciliation with the Colonies, 22 Mar. 1775, *Works* (Bohn 1854–56), 1:464–71; The Founders' Constitution, 1:1:2 (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD) [ERC-PRIMARY].

Jefferson, in his Autobiography, on the committee and his drafting of
the Declaration:

SOURCE — Jefferson, Autobiography (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD):
> "The committee for drawing the declaration of Independence desired me to do it. It was accordingly done, and being approved by them, I reported it to the house on Friday the 28th of June when it was read and ordered to lie on the table."
> — Thomas Jefferson, Autobiography, in *The Works of Thomas Jefferson*, ed. Paul Leicester Ford, vol. 1 (New York: G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1904) (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD) [ERC-PRIMARY].

The war is fought over **who governs and by what right**—not over
rejection of law or representation. America claims continuity of
Anglian grammar against Crown and Parliament.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. WASHINGTON & CONTINENTAL ENDURANCE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Continental Army and militia sustain the conflict.

Elements:
• George Washington as commander—restraint, preservation of force,
  deference to civilian authority (Congress); legitimacy of command
  derived from consent and endurance
• Asymmetric war—avoidance of decisive British victory; force
  preservation; logistics and morale over pitched battle
• Valley Forge (1777–1778); institutionalisation of army; French
  alliance (1778) alters strategic balance

Victory is framed as **survival and alliance**, not annihilation
of the enemy. The republic-in-formation outlasts imperial will.

Paine's *American Crisis* No. I (Dec. 1776) was read to the troops;
it raised the moral cost of quitting and bound reader and soldier to
endurance:

SOURCE — Paine, *The American Crisis*, No. I (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD):
> "These are the times that try men's souls. The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of their country; but he that stands it now, deserves the love and thanks of man and woman."
> — Thomas Paine, *The American Crisis*, No. I (Dec. 1776), in *Writings of Thomas Paine*, ed. Moncure Daniel Conway (1894), or standard ed. (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD) [ERC-PRIMARY].

Ron Chernow, in *Washington: A Life* (2010), on the Continental Army
and Washington's role:

SOURCE — Chernow, *Washington: A Life* (ARC-T-MODERN):
> "It always stood on the brink of dissolution, and Washington was the one figure who kept it together, the spiritual and managerial genius of the whole enterprise: he had been resilient in the face of every setback, courageous in the face of every danger."
> — Ron Chernow, *Washington: A Life* (New York: Penguin, 2010) (ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-SECONDARY].

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. FRENCH ALLIANCE AS SYSTEMIC SHIFT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
French entry (1778) transforms war geometry.

Effects:
• Naval parity against Britain; globalisation of conflict
• Yorktown (1781)—French fleet blocks British relief; Washington
  and Rochambeau force Cornwallis's surrender; decisive nodal
  victory
• Alliance as **strategic necessity**—America secures independence
  with external power; procedure (treaty, coordination) extends
  to great-power partnership

The war ceases to be colonial rebellion and becomes **imperial
contest**; American independence is sealed when Britain cannot
hold the theatre. Franklin, who would negotiate the French alliance,
had already foreseen the need for foreign aid:

SOURCE — Franklin, letter (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD):
> "After another campaign, we may find it necessary to ask aid of some foreign power."
> — Benjamin Franklin, Dec. 1775, in *The Papers of Benjamin Franklin* (Yale), or *Works*, ed. Sparks (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD) [ERC-PRIMARY].

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. YORKTOWN & TERMINATION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Yorktown forces British strategic reassessment.

Sequence:
• Siege of Yorktown (September–October 1781); Cornwallis surrenders
• British political will collapses; North falls; negotiations begin
• Treaty of Paris (1783)—independence recognised; territory defined;
  procedural exit by Britain without homeland invasion
• America encodes **victory through coalition and endurance**—
  institutional birth recognised by the former sovereign

Termination is **diplomatic and procedural**; no revolutionary
purge of the defeated. Britain exits; America continues under
inherited grammar.

John Keegan, in *Fields of Battle: The Wars for North America* (1996),
argues that American distinctiveness is shaped by geography and scale:

SOURCE — Keegan, *Fields of Battle* (ARC-T-MODERN):
> Americans "live in space, not time"—differing from Europeans in how
> the vast spaces of the continent shape culture and war.
> — John Keegan, *Fields of Battle: The Wars for North America* (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1996) (ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-SECONDARY]. Theme as summarised in critical reception; verbatim phrase "live in space, not time" attributed to Keegan.

The War of Independence is fought over that space; endurance and
alliance prevail when imperial power cannot hold the distance.

VI. CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The War of American Independence encodes **procedural secession and
founding through alliance**.

Lessons:
• Secession from empire can be framed as continuity of rights and
  procedure—rebellion against overreach, not against form.
• Endurance and alliance can substitute for overwhelming force;
  French entry as systemic shift; Yorktown as nodal victory.
• Civilian control and restraint (Washington) legitimate military
  command; the general serves the Congress and returns power.
• Treaty of Paris encodes **recognition**—independence granted by
  the former sovereign; procedure survives the break.
• America is born from Anglian grammar externalised; the war is
  founding, not civilizational rupture.

The war is America's **institutional origin**: armed exit, French
alliance, Yorktown, and Treaty of Paris. Tocqueville, a half-century
later, described the republic that this war had secured—sovereignty
divided, results visible in the states:

SOURCE — Tocqueville, *Democracy in America*, Vol. I (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD):
> "The sovereignty of the Union is an abstract thing which is connected with but few external objects. The sovereignty of the States is perceived by the senses, is understood without effort; every day it produces results which fall under every eye."
> — Alexis de Tocqueville, *Democracy in America*, Vol. I (1835), ed. Mansfield and Winthrop (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2000) or equivalent (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD) [ERC-PRIMARY].
