I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves James K. Polk as **America's single-term
expansion president**: the figure who completed continental
expansion by annexing Texas, settling Oregon with Britain, and
waging the Mexican–American War to secure California and the
Southwest—channeling Jacksonian energy into **procedure**: tariff,
independent treasury, and congressional declaration of war.

Polk does not break the republic.
He **executes** its territorial design through institutional
forms—civilian authority, declaration, treaty. Legitimacy and
conquest are aligned by process; moral reckoning is deferred.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

III. ORIGIN: JACKSON'S HEIR, DARK HORSE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Polk emerges as a Jackson protégé in Tennessee politics and the
House—Speaker, governor—then wins the 1844 Democratic nomination
as a "dark horse" on an **expansionist platform**: Texas and
Oregon as explicit goals.

Legitimacy is **programmatic**: the people have chosen expansion;
the president will deliver it. Procedure (nomination, election,
then congressional authorisation) frames the mandate.

Robert W. Merry, in *A Country of Vast Designs* (2009), characterises
Polk's drive as a blend of narrow imagination and relentless execution:

SOURCE — Merry, *A Country of Vast Designs* (ARC-T-MODERN):
> "limited imagination tied to a propulsive ambition and an unceasing tenacity"
> — Robert W. Merry, *A Country of Vast Designs: James K. Polk, the Mexican War, and the Conquest of the American Continent* (New York: Simon & Schuster, 2009) (ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-SECONDARY]. Characterisation of Polk regarding expansion; page ref to be added from print copy.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. SINGLE TERM: TERRITORIAL DESIGN EXECUTED
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Polk delivers in one term what he promised.

Sequence:
• Texas annexation (1845)—already in motion; Polk secures it
• Oregon (1846)—compromise with Britain (49th parallel);
  continental northwest secured without war
• Tariff of 1846; Independent Treasury restored—economic
  and fiscal order aligned with Democratic design
• Mexican–American War (1846–1848)—border dispute (Nueces
  vs. Rio Grande), provocation, Congress declares war; victory;
  Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo (1848): California, Southwest,
  Rio Grande border

The **structural picture** is clear: Mexico weak and divided;
Britain accommodating on Oregon; U.S. institutions (Congress,
army, treasury) sufficient to authorise and wage a short war.
Force ratio and diplomatic context made expansion low-risk;
Polk's incentive was to complete the continental design while
political capital held.

Jefferson, in his annual message to Congress (1803) on the
Louisiana Purchase, had already framed western expansion as
security and "blessings of freedom and equal laws"—ideological
precedent for Polk's territorial execution:

SOURCE — Jefferson, Annual Message to Congress (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD):
> "Whilst the property and sovereignty of the Mississippi and its waters secure an independent outlet for the produce of the Western states, and an uncontrolled navigation through their whole course, free from collision with other powers, the fertility of the country, its climate and extent, promise in due season important aids to our treasury, an ample provision for our posterity, and a wide spread for the blessings of freedom and equal laws."
> — Thomas Jefferson, Annual Message to Congress, 17 Oct. 1803, in *The Papers of Thomas Jefferson*, vol. 41, ed. Barbara B. Oberg (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2014) (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD) [ERC-PRIMARY].

Polk operationalises that vision—by treaty where possible
(Oregon), by war and treaty where necessary (Mexico).

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. WAR AS PROCEDURAL CHOICE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Mexican–American War is **declared** by Congress after
Polk's message on American blood shed on American soil (Rio Grande
claim). Provocation—U.S. troops in disputed territory—precedes
incident; Congress authorises war. Victory is swift; settlement
is by treaty.

Legitimacy flows from **authorisation**: the president requests;
Congress declares; the army executes; the treaty ratifies. Violence
is channelled through procedure. The moral cost—slavery extension
into new territory, sectional conflict—is deferred; Lincoln and
others oppose the war as congressmen, but the institutional
outcome holds.

Merry emphasises that the war was politically fraught and far from
a foregone conclusion—luck and British diplomatic stance mattered;
Mexico is not simply the innocent victim of aggression. The structural
incentive for expansion coexists with contingency in outcome.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Polk encodes **expansion through procedure**: territorial design
executed by a single-term president who used Congress, treaty,
and war in sequence—Jackson's heir without Jackson's anti-
institutional rhetoric. The republic absorbs conquest; legitimacy
is preserved by form. Downstream: Civil War over the territory
Polk acquired; legitimacy and moral reckoning deferred, not
cancelled.

Lessons:
• Single-term focus can concentrate political will on a clear
  territorial programme.
• Congressional declaration and treaty legitimise conquest;
  procedure authorises expansion.
• Force ratio and diplomatic context (weak Mexico, accommodating
  Britain) make expansion rational from a structural perspective.
• Executive direction plus institutional compliance complete
  continental scale; the president is agent, not dictator.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Polk is Jefferson's territorial vision executed; Jackson's
  authority channelled into procedure.
• One term, four goals (Texas, Oregon, tariff, treasury, war):
  programme discipline.
• War declared by Congress; ended by treaty; conquest absorbed.
• Moral reckoning deferred—slavery in new territories; Lincoln
  and Civil War as downstream.

Tension preserved without verdict.
