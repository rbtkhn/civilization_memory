I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves the Vicksburg campaign as **America's
structural turning point in the Civil War**: the Union seizure of
the Mississippi chokepoint (siege and surrender July 4, 1863) that
split the Confederacy, denied western resources to eastern armies,
and made Confederate defeat materially inevitable while procedure
(elections, civilian command) continued.

Vicksburg is not remembered for rhetoric.
It is remembered for **circulation and finality**.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

II. STRATEGIC CONTEXT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
By 1862–1863 the Union objective is to restore federal authority by
reasserting control over continental circulation. The Mississippi
links western food, manpower, and supply to Confederate eastern
theatres. Vicksburg, on high bluffs, blocks that flow. While it
holds, the Confederacy functions as one system; when it falls, the
system is severed.

John Keegan, in *The American Civil War: A Military History* (2009),
on the Western theatre:

SOURCE — Keegan, *The American Civil War* (ARC-T-MODERN):
> "No one on either side seems to have appreciated that the water lines
> in the Mississippi Valley formed an avenue of military advance into
> the Deep South, culminating eventually at New Orleans."
> — John Keegan, *The American Civil War: A Military History* (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 2009) (ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-SECONDARY]. Quote as cited in Gallagher, *Washington Post*, 10 Jan 2010.

Vicksburg is where that avenue is contested and then secured by Grant.

III. OPERATIONAL CHARACTER
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The campaign is marked by persistence, not spectacle.

Elements:
• Multi-month maneuver and siege; naval–army coordination
• Grant abandons repeated frontal assaults for encirclement;
  supply lines cut; city isolated
• Engineering, supply, and patience over single climactic battle
• Surrender July 4, 1863 (same week as Gettysburg); Port Hudson
  falls shortly after—Mississippi under Union control

Grant to James H. Wilson (July 1863): "The fall of Vicksburg is the
severest blow that has yet been given the Confederacy. It will open
the Mississippi River and permit supplies to be sent from the West."
Outcome: Confederacy split east–west; western armies isolated;
strategic initiative passes permanently to the Union. The war does not
end, but its **outcome becomes constrained**.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Vicksburg encodes **logistics and geography as determinants of
union restoration**—control of flow over valor; procedure (Grant
under Lincoln) and industrial reach over Confederate space.

Lessons:
• River control and chokepoints determine continental coherence;
  inland maritime logic at American scale.
• Patience and encirclement can replace costly assault; attrition
  as procedural warfare.
• Union victory is structural before it is symbolic; Vicksburg and
  Gettysburg (same week) together fix moral and material turning.

V. MEM CONNECTIONS (MANDATORY)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
AMERICA:
• MEM–AMERICA–WAR–AMERICAN–CIVIL — Parent war; scale and attrition;
  river control; Vicksburg as strategic severance.
• MEM–AMERICA–GRANT — Campaign commander; siege and surrender;
  attrition logic; civilian subordination.
• MEM–AMERICA–WAR–AMERICAN–CIVIL–SHERMAN — Participant (Vicksburg
  with Grant); later Atlanta and March to the Sea; same western
  theatre logic.
• MEM–AMERICA–WAR–AMERICAN–CIVIL–GETTYSBURG — Same week July 1863;
  Gettysburg symbolic/legitimacy inflection; Vicksburg material
  severance; dual turning point.
• MEM–AMERICA–WAR–AMERICAN–CIVIL–APPOMATTOX — Vicksburg makes
  defeat inevitable; Appomattox executes procedural termination.

Cross-Civilizational:
• MEM–ANGLIA–WAR–AMERICAN–CIVIL–VICKSBURG — Anglian encoding;
  logistical severance; same campaign, different frame.

Cross-references denote lineage, not equivalence.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Vicksburg: control of circulation; Confederacy split; Grant's
  severest blow; July 4, 1863.
• Inland maritime logic; procedure and patience over spectacle.
• Paired with Gettysburg (same week)—material and moral turning.

Tension preserved without verdict.
