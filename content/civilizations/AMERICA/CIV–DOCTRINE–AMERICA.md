**DERIVATION CLAUSE (BINDING):**
This doctrine registry is **derived from CIV–DOCTRINE–ANGLIA**. America inherits
the Anglian doctrinal grammar and adapts it to: (a) written constitutionalism
and federal structure; (b) Western Hemisphere hegemon role; (c) dual-ocean
(Atlantic–Pacific) strategic posture; (d) 1945 inheritance of British Empire
role and 1991 unipolar structural condition. Doctrines 01–07 are one-to-one
adaptations of Anglian doctrines 01–07, accepted as the initial doctrine set
via DIB–AMERICA. Subsequent doctrines must follow the standard admissibility
chain (FROZEN SYNTHESIS in CIV–SCHOLAR–AMERICA → DIB–AMERICA).

I. PURPOSE & AUTHORITY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file is the **exclusive registry of accepted American
civilizational doctrines**.

It contains:
• Doctrines explicitly accepted via DIB–AMERICA
• Definitions suitable for CIV–CORE citation (CIV–CORE–AMERICA v1.0)
• Controlled illustrative material for training and sequencing clarity
• No learning history
• No beliefs
• No provisional or rejected doctrines (see Section IV)

This file:
• Does NOT learn
• Does NOT synthesize
• Does NOT evolve autonomously

Authority Flow:
CIV–MEM–CORE → CIV–CORE–AMERICA → DIB–AMERICA → CIV–DOCTRINE–AMERICA
For derived doctrines 01–07: CIV–DOCTRINE–ANGLIA → adaptation → DIB–AMERICA → CIV–DOCTRINE–AMERICA

Doctrine Admissibility Rules (per Template § III):
A doctrine MAY be entered here ONLY if: (1) it originates from a FROZEN SYNTHESIS
in CIV–SCHOLAR–AMERICA, OR it is an approved adaptation from CIV–DOCTRINE–ANGLIA
as part of this derivation; (2) the synthesis or derivation was explicitly
accepted by DIB–AMERICA; (3) a new doctrine version is assigned.
Prohibited: draft doctrines, candidate beliefs, analytical hypotheses, scholar
commentary, historical narration.

Only doctrines listed here may be treated as **authoritative**.
Illustrative and relational material is **non-authoritative and non-citable**.

II. DOCTRINAL RELATIONSHIP & SEQUENCING OVERVIEW (NON-AUTHORITATIVE)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This section provides **contextual guidance only**.
It does not introduce requirements, axioms, or binding order.

Purpose:
• Prevent misordered application
• Support training and Scholar-mode traversal
• Clarify co-activation and gating relationships

Key principle:
→ American doctrines function as a **system**, not as independent maxims.
→ They inherit the Anglian relationship logic; American conditions (written
  constitution, hemisphere hegemon, two-ocean posture) refine application.

• Reinforces morale and compliance
• Does not generate power independently
• Never substitutes for procedure or capacity

Sequencing Note:
Misapplication (e.g., invoking delay, coalition logic, or myth without
procedural legitimacy intact) degrades outcomes and may invert effects.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II.B. APPLICATION CAUTION (NON-AUTHORITATIVE)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Doctrine 01 is **foundational**; others presuppose its presence.
• Doctrines 02 and 03 are **rupture-handling doctrines**, not peacetime optimizers.
• Doctrines 04–06 amplify power only when procedural continuity holds.
• Doctrine 07 stabilizes outcomes but cannot initiate them.

III. DOCTRINE REGISTRY (AUTHORITATIVE)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

DOCTRINE 01
Name: PROCEDURE AS CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY
Status: ACCEPTED · LOCKED · CANONICAL
Source: CIV–DOCTRINE–ANGLIA 01 → DIB–AMERICA (Derived, Approved)

Definition:
America preserves civilizational continuity not primarily through
territory, dynasty, or ideology, but through **procedure**: repeatable,
precedent-based processes that encode authority, legitimacy, and dispute
resolution across time. Procedure functions as memory, allowing America
to survive regime change, electoral reversal, and moral contradiction
without civilizational reset. The written Constitution and federal
structure **codify** what Anglia leaves implicit; authority resides in
process and precedent, not persons.

Operational Meaning:
• Authority resides in process, not persons
• Continuity survives defeat if procedure remains intact
• Law, precedent, and institutional habit substitute for ideology
• Constitutional and congressional process anchor legitimacy

Illustrative Cases (Non-Authoritative):
• Constitutional amendment and succession (no regime collapse)
• Common law and precedent (inherited from Anglia, formalised)
• Post–Civil War Reconstruction within constitutional frame

Related Doctrines (Contextual, Non-Authoritative):
• Doctrine 02 (Rupture Absorption)
• Doctrine 03 (Defeat Without Collapse)
• Doctrine 07 (Myth as Stabilizer)

Hard Constraints:
• Procedure fails if enforcement collapses entirely
• Procedure degrades if legitimacy outpaces perceived fairness
• Procedure cannot compensate for total elite eradication (see Doctrine 02)

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

DOCTRINE 02
Name: RUPTURE ABSORPTION THROUGH ELITE REPLACEMENT
Status: ACCEPTED · LOCKED · CANONICAL
Source: CIV–DOCTRINE–ANGLIA 02 → DIB–AMERICA (Derived, Approved)

Definition:
America can survive even catastrophic rupture when it results in
**elite replacement rather than institutional annihilation**. Civil war,
reconstruction, or client-state transformation becomes survivable if new
elites adopt, hybridize with, or are absorbed into America’s procedural
grammar, rather than destroying it. Applied at home (Reconstruction) or
abroad (post-1945 Germany, Japan), the principle holds: institutions
repurposed, not erased.

Operational Meaning:
• Defeat or rupture is survivable if institutions are repurposed, not erased
• Elite continuity is less important than institutional continuity
• Hybridization can strengthen long-term durability
• Allied and client elites may be replaced provided procedural order is adopted

Illustrative Cases (Non-Authoritative):
• Reconstruction (1865–1877) — elite replacement, constitutional continuity
• Post-1945 Germany and Japan — institutional repurposing under U.S. aegis

Related Doctrines (Contextual, Non-Authoritative):
• Doctrine 01 (Procedure as Memory)
• Doctrine 03 (Defeat Without Collapse)

Hard Constraints:
• Rupture becomes terminal if procedures are fully dismantled
• Replacement fails if new elites rule purely through coercion
• Total cultural erasure invalidates absorption

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

DOCTRINE 03
Name: DEFEAT WITHOUT LEGITIMACY COLLAPSE
Status: ACCEPTED · LOCKED · CANONICAL
Source: CIV–DOCTRINE–ANGLIA 03 → DIB–AMERICA (Derived, Approved)

Definition:
America can lose wars, territory, and influence without internal
legitimacy collapse, provided defeat is **procedurally managed**.

Operational Meaning:
• Congressional and public debate substitute for regime crisis
• Exit preserves legitimacy better than denial
• Retrenchment is a strategic option, not failure
• Inherited from Anglia: Yorktown encoded British exit without legitimacy
  collapse; America applies the same grammar to its own exits

Illustrative Cases (Non-Authoritative):
• Vietnam exit — procedural and electoral processing of withdrawal
• Imperial withdrawals with legal and institutional continuity (Anglian precedent)

Related Doctrines (Contextual, Non-Authoritative):
• Doctrine 01 (Procedure)
• Doctrine 02 (Rupture Absorption)

Hard Constraints:
• Defeat destabilizes if framed as illegitimate
• Procedural exit requires elite and institutional compliance
• Repeated defeats without adaptation erode confidence

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

DOCTRINE 04
Name: TIME AS A STRATEGIC WEAPON
Status: ACCEPTED · LOCKED · CANONICAL
Source: CIV–DOCTRINE–ANGLIA 04 → DIB–AMERICA (Derived, Approved)

Definition:
America converts time into power through finance, institutional patience,
and coalition endurance. Outlast, do not overpower.

Operational Meaning:
• Delay favors systems with fiscal continuity
• Attrition is preferable to decisive confrontation
• Victory achieved by outlasting, not overpowering
• Containment and alliance investment (e.g. NATO, Marshall Plan) embody
  time-as-weapon: coalition and fiscal durability over quick victory

Illustrative Cases (Non-Authoritative):
• Cold War containment — outspend and outlast
• Marshall Plan and NATO as investments in coalition staying power

Related Doctrines (Contextual, Non-Authoritative):
• Doctrine 05 (Coalition Primacy)
• Doctrine 06 (Dual-Ocean Denial)

Hard Constraints:
• Fiscal collapse negates time advantage
• Coalition fracture nullifies delay
• Time cannot compensate for procedural loss

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

DOCTRINE 05
Name: COALITION PRIMACY OVER SINGULAR VICTORY
Status: ACCEPTED · LOCKED · CANONICAL
Source: CIV–DOCTRINE–ANGLIA 05 → DIB–AMERICA (Derived, Approved)

Definition:
America maximizes power by subordinating authorship to coalition durability.
Legitimacy is externalized through alliances and multilateral frameworks.

Operational Meaning:
• Allies absorb cost America avoids; legitimacy is shared
• Victory legitimacy externalized (e.g. UN, NATO)
• Balance and alliance prioritized over unilateral dominance
• Hemisphere and global order framed as coalition-led, not empire

Illustrative Cases (Non-Authoritative):
• NATO and UN as legitimacy and burden-sharing frameworks
• Korean War and later interventions under multilateral cover where possible

Related Doctrines (Contextual, Non-Authoritative):
• Doctrine 04 (Time)
• Doctrine 06 (Dual-Ocean Denial)

Hard Constraints:
• Coalitions fail without finance and force-projection support
• Delegation fails if command integration collapses
• Ineffective vs legitimacy-immune adversaries

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

DOCTRINE 06
Name: DUAL-OCEAN DENIAL AS EXISTENTIAL DEFENSE
Status: ACCEPTED · LOCKED · CANONICAL
Source: CIV–DOCTRINE–ANGLIA 06 → DIB–AMERICA (Derived, Approved)

Definition:
America’s security depends on denial of hostile movement across the
**Atlantic and Pacific**, not conquest. Sea control substitutes for
land mass; invasion prevention outweighs battle victory. Maritime
dominance in both oceans converts geography into hemisphere and
global security.

Operational Meaning:
• Atlantic and Pacific control are both necessary for hemisphere hegemony
  and for alliance assurance (Europe, Asia)
• Sea control substitutes for land mass
• Invasion prevention outweighs battle victory
• Maritime dominance converts geography into security

Illustrative Cases (Non-Authoritative):
• Two-ocean navy and alliance assurance (NATO, Pacific alliances)
• Hemisphere perimeter control (Monroe Doctrine as maritime-territorial logic)

Related Doctrines (Contextual, Non-Authoritative):
• Doctrine 04 (Time)
• Doctrine 05 (Coalition Primacy)

Hard Constraints:
• Naval failure in either ocean exposes the core or allies immediately
• Denial fails if logistics or basing collapse
• Control must be continuous in both theaters

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

DOCTRINE 07
Name: MYTH AS STABILIZER, NOT ENGINE
Status: ACCEPTED · LOCKED · CANONICAL
Source: CIV–DOCTRINE–ANGLIA 07 → DIB–AMERICA (Derived, Approved)

Definition:
America uses myth to stabilize institutions, not to generate power.

Operational Meaning:
• Narrative reinforces compliance (e.g. "free world," "leader of the free world")
• Symbolism sustains morale during loss or retreat
• Myth follows success; it does not create it
• Cold War and post–Cold War narratives stabilise alliance and domestic
  support but cannot substitute for procedure or capacity

Illustrative Cases (Non-Authoritative):
• Cold War rhetoric without regime change
• Post-defeat or post-retreat national narratives (e.g. post-Vietnam)

Related Doctrines (Contextual, Non-Authoritative):
• Doctrine 01 (Procedure)
• Doctrine 03 (Defeat Without Collapse)

Hard Constraints:
• Myth collapses if contradicted by procedure
• Symbolism cannot override institutional failure
• Narrative without enforcement accelerates decay

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. EXPLICITLY EXCLUDED MATERIAL (MANDATORY)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The following doctrines have been explicitly rejected (inherited from
CIV–DOCTRINE–ANGLIA and affirmed for America):
• PERMANENT MORAL SUPERIORITY — REJECTED
• INEVITABLE PROGRESS — REJECTED

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. DOCTRINE MIRRORING REQUIREMENT (MANDATORY)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This doctrine registry MUST be mirrored verbatim into:
• CIV–CORE–AMERICA (v1.0; doctrine citation binding)
• CIV–SCHOLAR–AMERICA

Mirroring Rules:
• Mirroring is declarative, not interpretive
• All ACCEPTED doctrines must be mirrored (REJECTED doctrines are excluded)
• Mirrored doctrines provide citation surface for CIV–CORE engines
• CIV–DOCTRINE–AMERICA remains the single source of truth for doctrine definitions

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. CITATION RULES
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
CIV–CORE–AMERICA and CIV–STATE–AMERICA may cite:
• Doctrine Name
• Version
• Doctrine Number

Illustrative cases, relationships, and diagrams:
• NON-CITABLE
• NON-AUTHORITATIVE

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI-A. APPLICATION, CONTINGENCY & EXECUTIVE USE (NON-AUTHORITATIVE)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This section sharpens application of doctrines 01–07 based on
executive-use and historical-audit insight. It does not add or
modify binding doctrine; it clarifies how the registry should be
understood and used.

HEURISTIC STATUS:
• Doctrines 01–07 are **risk-reducing heuristics**, not guarantees.
  Compliance improves the expected distribution of outcomes across
  many decisions and reduces fragility to bad contingency; it does
  not ensure success in any single case.
• Violation (e.g. bypassing process, acting without coalition or
  exit path) has sometimes produced good results when contingency
  (luck, opponent choices, events) favored the actor. The cost is
  precedent and increased future fragility; the same violation in
  another context may compound.
• Single-case success or failure should not be read as proof that
  doctrine is unnecessary or that violation is safe. The appropriate
  question is whether structure (process, coalition, exit, narrative)
  was used to reduce dependence on luck.

CONTINGENCY:
• Outcomes depend on **structure** (what the actor controls: process,
  coalition, exit plan, narrative) and **contingency** (what the actor
  does not fully control: opponent moves, events, luck). Doctrines
  aim to maximise the share of outcomes explained by structure and
  to reduce dependence on contingency. They do not eliminate
  contingency.

EXECUTIVE USE:
• For presidential and senior-executive use, a derived one-page brief
  exists: **DIB–AMERICA–PRESIDENTIAL–DOCTRINE–BRIEF**. It
  translates doctrines 01–07 into plain-English principles and a
  decision checklist. The registry (this file) remains the
  authoritative source for doctrine definitions and for audit;
  the Presidential Doctrine Brief is the recommended interface for
  executive stress-testing of options.
