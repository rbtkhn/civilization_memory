I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves the Seven Years' War (French and Indian War
in North America) as **America's colonial-phase imperial war**:
the conflict in which British North American colonies fought
as part of Britain's global war against France, Britain won
(Canada, Ohio Valley, Treaty of Paris 1763), and postwar
imperial governance—taxation, authority, finance—created the
strain that led to American independence.

For America, the war is **prelude to founding**—colonial
participation in imperial victory, then imperial overreach;
Washington's first military lessons; the empire that wins
then loses its American extension.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

II. NORTH AMERICAN THEATRE: FRENCH AND INDIAN WAR
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The war begins in the Ohio Valley and expands.

Context:
• Colonial rivalry (Britain vs. France) in North America;
  Ohio Valley, Canada, frontier
• Colonial militias and British regulars; Washington's early
  command (Virginia); defeat and lesson (Fort Necessity, etc.)
• Quebec (1759); fall of New France; Treaty of Paris (1763)—
  France cedes Canada and eastern Louisiana to Britain

Britain's victory creates an **empire of unprecedented scale**
in North America; colonists share in the victory but then face
the costs—governance, finance, and authority that Britain
is ill-prepared to resolve (Anderson, *Crucible of War*).

John Keegan, in *Fields of Battle: The Wars for North America* (1996),
frames the continent's wars as shaped by geography and scale:

SOURCE — Keegan, *Fields of Battle* (ARC-T-MODERN):
> "The vast spaces of North America shaped the wars fought on the
> continent."
> — John Keegan, *Fields of Battle: The Wars for North America* (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1996) (ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-SECONDARY]. Thesis of the work; verbatim formulation from book's scope.

The French and Indian War is the first of those continental-scale
contests; Washington learns his first military lessons in that
theatre (Churchill, *The Age of Revolution*). At Albany (1754),
Franklin had already argued that colonial disunity encouraged the
French and that union was the condition for preservation:

SOURCE — Franklin, Albany Plan (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD):
> "That an union of the colonies is absolutely necessary for their preservation."
> — Benjamin Franklin, "Reasons and Motives for the Albany Plan of Union," July 1754, in *Papers of Benjamin Franklin* 5:399–417; The Founders' Constitution, 1:7:2 (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD) [ERC-PRIMARY].

III. IMPERIAL STRAIN AS CONSEQUENCE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Postwar governance triggers the independence crisis.

Elements:
• Britain's debt and need for revenue; taxation of colonies
  (Stamp Act, Townshend, etc.); "no taxation without representation"
• Extension of imperial authority; quartering; restriction of
  western settlement (Proclamation of 1763)
• Colonial resistance; institutional maturity (assemblies,
  grievance); war had **enlarged** British domains to a size
  difficult to control (Anderson)

The war that removed the French threat **also** created the
administrative and fiscal pressure that turns colonists toward
secession. Victory contains the seeds of loss.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. WASHINGTON AND THE FOUNDING GENERATION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Colonial officers gain experience that shapes the republic.

Elements:
• Washington's first military lessons (Churchill: "a young
  Virginian officer named George Washington learnt his first
  military lessons"); restraint and endurance later encoded
  in his command
• Continental scale and logistics; frontier warfare; alliance
  with British regulars and colonial cooperation
• The same generation that fights for Britain in the 1750s
  will lead the Continental Army in the 1770s

The war is **pedagogical** for the founding generation—military
experience, imperial overreach observed, then revolution.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Seven Years' War encodes **colonial victory, imperial strain,
and prelude to independence**.

Lessons:
• Colonial participation in imperial war can precede secession;
  victory expands the empire that then overreaches.
• Postwar governance and finance—taxation, authority—can
  trigger legitimacy crisis; the war that secures the frontier
  creates the strain that breaks the bond.
• Founding generation's military experience is formed in
  imperial war (Washington); restraint and procedure later
  applied to revolution and republic.
• Britain wins North America in 1763 and loses the thirteen
  colonies by 1783; the same war is prelude to both.

The war is America's **colonial prelude**: French and Indian
War, imperial victory, then imperial strain and independence.

AMERICA:
• MEM–AMERICA–WAR–AMERICAN–INDEPENDENCE — Postwar strain leads
  to revolution; Seven Years' War as cause of imperial crisis;
  same generation, second war.
• MEM–AMERICA–PRESIDENT–WASHINGTON — First military lessons in this war;
  colonial officer; later commander of Continental Army; restraint
  and deference formed in imperial context.
• MEM–AMERICA–GEO–OHIO–RIVER — Theatre of conflict; imperial
  competition; "Origin of Seven Years' War" (subject tag).
• MEM–AMERICA–PRESIDENT–JEFFERSON — Founding generation; postwar strain
  and grievance; Declaration logic.
• MEM–AMERICA–PRESIDENT–ADAMS — Founding generation; postwar resistance
  and independence.

Cross-Civilizational:
• MEM–ANGLIA–WAR–SEVEN–YEARS — British perspective; global war;
  imperial confirmation; victory and North American primacy.
• MEM–FRANCIA–WAR–SEVEN–YEARS — French defeat; loss of Canada;
  same war, opposite outcome.

VII. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Imperial victory creates imperial strain; postwar governance
  triggers secession.
