# MEMORANDUM

**TO:** Chief of Staff to the President  
**FROM:** [Senior Advisor / Policy Coordinator]  
**DATE:** [Month Day, Year]  
**RE:** Recommendation — Options Completeness Protocol for Major Commitments

---

## Recommendation

Implement an **Options Completeness Protocol** across executive branch operations: whenever the President is presented with a decision that involves **sustaining, expanding, or entering a major commitment** (alliance obligation, arms transfer, force posture, sanctions regime, or sustained confrontation with a state or non-state actor), the option set **must** include at least one option at the **accommodation/reversal** end of the spectrum—e.g., reduce, pause, negotiate exit, or seek a modus vivendi with the counterpart. The inclusion of that option and a one-line notation of compliance must be documented in the decision memo or option paper that reaches the President.

This is a **process** requirement, not a policy preference. It does not favor accommodation over commitment. It ensures the President sees the full range of choices so that any decision—including the decision to sustain or escalate—is made with the alternative visible. If the President later recalibrates or reverses, the record will support the narrative that reversal was a **considered choice**, not a forced retreat.

---

## Rationale

**1. Legitimacy and narrative.** When reversal or retrenchment is never presented as an option, the eventual pullback is encoded in public and institutional memory as defeat or collapse. When it was on the table and the President chose not to take it—or chose it later—the same material outcome can be encoded as strategic choice. This protocol aligns with the principle that **procedure supports legitimacy**: the option set is part of what gets remembered.

**2. Institutional bias.** Staff and agencies naturally produce option sets that favor sustaining the current posture (“how do we hold the line?”). The “walk away” or “settle” option is often omitted unless explicitly required. A mandatory protocol corrects for that bias without changing anyone’s substantive judgment; it only requires that the full spectrum be briefed.

**3. Accountability.** If the President is never given the accommodation option and things later go wrong, the gap is “we never had a real exit.” If the option was given, documented, and the President chose to stay the course, accountability rests clearly with the decision. The protocol assigns responsibility by making the option set complete and visible.

**4. Precedent.** U.S. and inherited precedent support this. Successful exits (e.g., Vietnam under the Nixon administration, framed as “peace with honor”) were possible in part because withdrawal was a **named, negotiated option** on the table. Cases where reversal was not a briefed option have tended to encode later pullbacks as failure. The protocol operationalizes that lesson.

## Proposed Implementation

**Step 1 — Presidential directive.**  
Issue a short **National Security Memorandum (NSM)** or **Presidential Policy Directive (PPD)** establishing the Options Completeness Protocol. Define “major commitment” (e.g., new or materially expanded alliance obligation, arms sale above a threshold, new basing or sustained force posture, new or expanded sanctions program, or sustained confrontation with a named state or actor). Require that any decision memo or option paper presented to the President on such a commitment include at least one option at the accommodation/reversal end, with a one-line notation: “Reversal option included per NSM/PPD [title/date].”

**Step 2 — NSC enforcement.**  
Direct the National Security Council Staff to enforce the protocol for all NSC-coordinated decisions falling within scope. Add a standard line to the NSC options template and a checklist item before any Principals Committee (PC) or Deputies Committee (DC) package is finalized. The NSC Executive Secretary (or designee) confirms compliance before the package goes to the President.

**Step 3 — Government-wide extension.**  
Instruct the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Office of the White House Counsel, in consultation with NSC, to issue implementing guidance to all executive departments and agencies: for any commitment within scope that is coordinated through the White House (whether or not it goes through the NSC), the originating agency must certify that the option set included a reversal option and that it was presented in good faith (not as a strawman). OMB may tie the requirement to existing budget and program justification processes where a commitment has significant resource implications.

**Step 4 — No public fanfare.**  
The directive and guidance should be internal. Public framing should be avoided or minimal (e.g., “the President has directed that option sets for major national security and foreign policy decisions include the full range of choices”). The goal is to improve the quality of decision support, not to signal a change in policy.

## Scope and Exceptions

- **In scope:** Decisions that commit or materially expand U.S. resources, credibility, or military/diplomatic posture—alliance obligations, arms transfers, basing, sanctions, sustained confrontation.
- **Out of scope:** Routine implementation, time-sensitive tactical decisions where the President has already set the strategic direction, or decisions that do not involve a “commitment” as defined.
- **Exception:** The President may waive the protocol for a specific decision in writing (e.g., in a crisis where speed precludes a full option set). Waiver should be rare and documented.

---

## Summary

Implementing the Options Completeness Protocol will not change *what* the President may decide. It will ensure that *all* material options—including accommodation and reversal—are presented and documented when the decision involves a major commitment. That strengthens legitimacy, clarifies accountability, and makes it possible for any future recalibration to be remembered as choice rather than collapse. I recommend that you approve this approach and direct the NSC and OMB to draft the directive and implementing guidance accordingly.
