I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves Woodrow Wilson as **America's idealist president
and contested legacy**: progressive reformer, wartime leader (WWI entry
1917), author of the Fourteen Points and champion of the League of
Nations, and the president whose second term was marked by Senate
rejection of the Treaty of Versailles, severe incapacity (stroke
1919), and a record—segregation in the federal government, Espionage
and Sedition Acts, repression of dissent—that has made his place in
American memory among the most **contested** of any president.

Wilson does not receive a single verdict here.
His encoding preserves **tension**: the rhetoric of self-determination
and "making the world safe for democracy" alongside the extension of
racial segregation in federal hiring and the suppression of speech
and assembly; the League as institutional aspiration and its failure
in the Senate; the president who preached openness and the president
who presided over censorship and prosecutions. Contradictions are
preserved without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. PROGRESSIVE REFORM & DOMESTIC RECORD
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Wilson's first term (1913–1917) advanced the progressive agenda.

Elements:
• Federal Reserve Act (1913)—central banking structure; regional
  banks and Board; response to financial panic and credit
• Federal Trade Commission (1914); Clayton Antitrust Act (1914)—
  regulation of competition; procedural extension of federal
  oversight
• Tariff reform; income tax (Sixteenth Amendment implemented)
• **Segregation in the federal government**—Wilson's administration
  extended or formalised racial segregation in federal departments
  (e.g. Treasury, Post Office); civil service separated by race;
  reversal of some desegregation that had existed under earlier
  administrations. This encoding is part of the contested legacy:
  the president who later invoked self-determination and democracy
  oversaw the entrenchment of Jim Crow in the national government.

Legitimacy in the progressive frame rested on **reform and order**—
regulated capitalism, expert administration. The same administration
that built the Fed and the FTC also built a more segregated federal
workforce.

III. WORLD WAR I: NEUTRALITY, ENTRY, FOURTEEN POINTS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Wilson led the United States from neutrality (1914–1917) into the
war (April 1917) and framed the peace.

Sequence:
• **Neutrality** — "He kept us out of war" (1916 campaign); loans
  and trade with Allies; submarine warfare and Lusitania; break
  with Germany over unrestricted U-boat war and Zimmermann
  telegram
• **Entry (April 1917)** — War message: "The world must be made
  safe for democracy." Congress declares war; AEF to France;
  Wilson as commander-in-chief and moral leader of the crusade
• **Fourteen Points (January 1918)** — Open covenants; free trade;
  self-determination; League of Nations; disarmament; moral and
  institutional frame for the peace
• **Versailles (1919)** — Wilson at Paris; Treaty of Versailles
  includes League Covenant; Wilson compromises on many points
  (reparations, borders) to secure the League; returns to face
  Senate

Wilson's war message (2 April 1917):

SOURCE — Wilson, War Message to Congress (ARC-T-MODERN):
> "The world must be made safe for democracy. Its peace must be planted upon the tested foundations of political liberty. We have no selfish ends to serve. We desire no conquest, no dominion. We seek no indemnities for ourselves, no material compensation for the sacrifices we shall freely make."
> — Woodrow Wilson, Address to Congress, 2 April 1917, in *Congressional Record*, 65th Cong., 1st Sess., 102–104 (ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-PRIMARY].

The rhetoric encodes **idealist legitimacy**—war as crusade for
democracy and a new order. The structural reality was alliance with
entente powers, material interest in their victory, and a peace
conference that produced a punitive treaty Wilson could not fully
control.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. LEAGUE OF NATIONS, SENATE REJECTION, INCAPACITY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Wilson staked his legacy on the League; the Senate refused.

Sequence:
• **League Covenant** — Article X (collective security); Wilson
  insisted it was the heart of the treaty; Lodge and reservationists
  demanded amendments or reservations
• **Senate rejection** — Treaty failed to gain two-thirds in 1919
  and again in 1920; the United States did not join the League;
  Wilson refused compromise (e.g. Lodge reservations), believing
  the treaty must stand or fall as he had negotiated it
• **Stroke (October 1919)** — Wilson suffered a severe stroke;
  incapacity for months; Edith Wilson and aides controlled access;
  no formal transfer of power; the president was unable to
  negotiate with the Senate or to lead; treaty and League died
  in part because the president could not function

Institutional continuity was **strained**: the Constitution had
no clear mechanism for declaring presidential incapacity; the
office continued while the person did not fully discharge it.
The League defeat encoded **idealist overreach** and **institutional
failure**—the president who had made the League the centre of his
peace could not secure it at home, and his incapacity made
compromise impossible.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. REPRESSION: ESPIONAGE ACT, SEDITION ACT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Wilson's wartime administration criminalised dissent.

Elements:
• Espionage Act (1917)—restriction of expression deemed to obstruct
  the war; prosecutions of socialists, pacifists, and critics
• Sedition Act (1918)—broader criminalisation of disloyal speech;
  thousands prosecuted; Debs imprisoned for anti-war speech
• Post-war Red Scare and Palmer raids (1919–1920)—Attorney General
  under Wilson; raids and deportations; repression extended beyond
  armistice

The president who invoked democracy and open covenants presided
over the **suppression of speech and assembly** at home. The
tension is preserved: idealist rhetoric abroad, coercive state
at home. Legitimacy in the security frame rested on unity and
conformity; procedure (First Amendment) was subordinated to
wartime necessity as the administration defined it.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Wilson encodes **idealist ambition and its limits**—and the
**contested legacy** of a president who expanded the rhetorical
and institutional reach of American purpose while embedding
segregation, repressing dissent, and failing to secure his
signature institution (the League) in the face of Senate
resistance and his own incapacity.

Lessons:
• Presidential rhetoric (democracy, self-determination) can
  outrun both domestic practice and structural possibility;
  the picture we have in our head of what we are fighting for
  may not match what the war delivers or what the polity will
  ratify.
• Incapacity without procedure: Wilson's stroke exposed the
  absence of a clear mechanism for temporary transfer; the
  office continued while the person could not perform.
• Idealist diplomacy (League, Fourteen Points) as **signal** and
  as **failure**—the signal influenced later order (UN, rhetoric
  of self-determination); the failure left the U.S. outside the
  League and the interwar order weaker.
• Contested legacy is part of the encoding: critics point to
  segregation, repression, Versailles collapse, and incapacity;
  defenders point to progressive reform, war leadership, and
  the aspiration to institutionalise peace. The MEM preserves
  both strands without synthesis.
