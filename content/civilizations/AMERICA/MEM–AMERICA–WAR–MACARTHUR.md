I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves **Douglas MacArthur as war figure**: his theatre
command in the Pacific (1941–1945) and Korea (1950–1951)—campaigns,
operational choices, and the strategic logic that led to victory in
one war and to clash and relief in the other. It is distinct from
MEM–AMERICA–MACARTHUR (full figure: civilian supremacy, relief,
civilizational memory function); here the focus is **MacArthur the
commander**—the campaigns he fought, the risks he took, and the
structural tension between theatre ambition and civilian policy.

It seems to me that the crucial point is that MacArthur won the
Pacific war by a combination of island-hopping, coalition management
( Australian and U.S. forces), and the symbolic return to the
Philippines—"I shall return"—which encoded both operational
sequence and legitimacy narrative. The question, really, is how
the same commander who accepted the Japanese surrender and governed
Japan as SCAP then in Korea advanced to the Yalu, provoked Chinese
intervention, and sought to expand the war when the president had
chosen limited war. One has to understand that his war record is
twofold: **theatre victory** (Pacific, Japan) and **theatre
overreach** (Korea), with relief as the procedural correction.
Institutional continuity appears in Truman's enforcement of civilian
supremacy—the general who defied policy was removed.

The fact is that the structural picture in Korea was clear: the
United States had a vested interest in containing North Korean
aggression without triggering general war with China. MacArthur's
incentive structure as theatre commander was to win decisively—to
destroy enemy forces, not to hold a line. When he advocated
expansion (bombing China, blockade, possible nuclear use), he
crossed the line that civilian authority had drawn. The name of the
game for the president was limited war; for MacArthur it was
victory. Relief resolved the conflict in favour of the president.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

II. PACIFIC THEATRE (1941–1945)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
MacArthur commanded U.S. and Allied forces in the Southwest Pacific.

Trajectory:
• **1941–1942** — Philippines invaded; MacArthur ordered to Australia;
  "I shall return" as public commitment; Bataan and Corregidor fall
  (others in command on the ground); MacArthur in Australia builds
  Supreme Command SWPA
• **1942–1944** — Papua (Buna–Gona); New Guinea campaigns; bypass
  and isolation of Japanese strongholds; island-hopping logic;
  coordination with Nimitz's Central Pacific drive
• **1944** — Leyte (October); MacArthur's return to the Philippines;
  Luzon (1945); Manila; Philippine Commonwealth restored
• **1945** — Japanese surrender (2 September, USS Missouri);
  MacArthur as accepting authority; theatre victory complete

Operational logic: avoid frontal assault on every island; seize
airfields and bases; cut Japanese supply lines; preserve Allied
force while grinding down Japanese capacity. Legitimacy was
theatre-based—the general who had left the Philippines returned
as liberator; the general who accepted surrender embodied American
victory.

III. KOREA: INCHON, ADVANCE, REVERSAL
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
MacArthur commanded United Nations forces in Korea from July 1950
until his relief in April 1951.

Sequence:
• **Pusan perimeter (1950)** — North Korean offensive drives ROK
  and U.S. forces south; MacArthur holds the line while planning
  counterstroke
• **Inchon landing (September 1950)** — Amphibious assault behind
  enemy lines; Seoul recaptured; breakout from Pusan; North Korean
  army broken
• **Advance to the Yalu** — UN forces drive north; MacArthur
  dismisses or downplays risk of Chinese intervention; Truman–MacArthur
  meeting at Wake Island (October)
• **Chinese intervention (November 1950)** — Massive counteroffensive;
  UN forces retreat; stalemate south of the 38th
• **Policy clash** — MacArthur advocates expanding the war: bombing
  China, naval blockade, use of Nationalist forces, possible nuclear
  options; Truman policy is limited war—contain aggression, avoid
  general war with China
• **Public defiance** — MacArthur's letters and statements challenge
  administration policy; Truman relieves him (11 April 1951)

Truman, in his memoirs, on the relief:

SOURCE — Truman, *Memoirs* (ARC-T-MODERN):
> "I could not allow a subordinate to defy the policy of the United States. … General MacArthur had failed to respect the authority of the President."
> — Harry S. Truman, *Memoirs*, Vol. 2, *Years of Trial and Hope* (Garden City, NY: Doubleday, 1956) (ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-PRIMARY].

The war continued as limited war under Ridgway, then armistice
(1953) under Eisenhower. MacArthur's relief encoded **civilian
supremacy**: the theatre commander who sought to expand the war
was removed; procedure over personality.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. THEATRE COMMAND & LIMITS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
MacArthur's war record illustrates the **ceiling** of theatre
command. In the Pacific, his discretion was broad—civilian authority
(FDR, Truman) set the strategic frame (defeat Japan), and MacArthur
executed with operational freedom. In Korea, civilian authority set
a different frame (limited war), and MacArthur's drive for victory
collided with it. The structural logic is unchanged: strategy and
escalation belong to the president; the general executes or is
relieved. Washington's precedent—deference to civilian authority,
surrender of command—is reaffirmed by MacArthur's **removal**: the
general who did not defer was fired. "Old soldiers never die, they
just fade away"—MacArthur's exit line encodes submission to
procedure even in departure.
