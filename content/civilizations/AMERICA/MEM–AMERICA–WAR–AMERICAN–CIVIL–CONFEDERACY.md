I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves the **Confederate States of America** as
America's civilizational memory of the secessionist polity: its
formation (compact theory, sovereignty claim), its military
expression (Lee, Jackson, eastern theatre, Vicksburg), its structural
limits (industrial and demographic inferiority, irreplaceable
commanders, attrition), and its **procedural termination**—defeat
without annihilation, reintegration via Appomattox and surrender
terms.

The Confederacy does not endure as a state.
It **encodes secession denied and then absorbed by procedure**.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. FORMATION & CLAIM
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Confederacy forms as a sovereignty claim against the Union.

Context:
• Secession (1860–1861)—South Carolina and others; compact theory
  of union; states as creators of federal authority; right of
  withdrawal asserted
• Confederate States of America; Jefferson Davis; capital Richmond;
  constitution modelled on the U.S. but embedding slavery; claim to
  lawful independence
• Union frame: **perpetual union**; secession as rebellion; no
  constitutional right to withdraw. Both sides claim legality.
  War resolves by force.

Fort Sumter: Confederacy fires first on federal property; Union
gains casus belli. The Confederacy is the **named opponent** in
America's union-preservation war—the polity whose existence the
Union denies by arms and whose territory and people it reclaims.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. MILITARY CAPACITY & LIMITS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Confederacy fields formidable armies and commanders but faces
structural constraints.

Capacity:
• Army of Northern Virginia (Lee); eastern theatre victories—
  Seven Days, Second Bull Run, Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville;
  Jackson's tactical brilliance; Lee's operational ambition
• Western theatre; Vicksburg as chokepoint—lost July 1863; Confederacy
  split; resource flow severed
• Gettysburg (July 1863)—Lee's invasion halted; Confederate
  offensive exhausted; Keegan on Lee's failure to control
  subordinates

Limits:
• Industrial and demographic inferiority; Union blockade; Union
  control of rivers and railways; attrition over time
• Irreplaceable commanders—Jackson's death (Chancellorsville 1863);
  no institutional depth to regenerate such figures
• Sherman's and Sheridan's campaigns—capacity and morale degraded;
  Lee surrounded and surrendered at Appomattox (April 9, 1865)

The Confederacy **fights to a structural end**: not destroyed in a
single battle but exhausted by denial of recovery, severance of
logistics, and procedural surrender.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. TERMINATION & REINTEGRATION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Defeat is framed as procedural, not revolutionary.

Sequence:
• Lee's surrender at Appomattox; Grant's terms—parole, no
  imprisonment; "The war is over; the rebels are our countrymen
  again." Other Confederate forces surrender; Davis captured;
  Confederacy ceases to exist as governing entity.
• Union choice: **reintegration**, not purge. Constitution amended
  (Thirteenth); union authority affirmed; defeated polity
  absorbed, not erased. Southern memory (Lost Cause, Lee as noble
  figure) persists alongside Union memory (rebellion suppressed,
  procedure preserved)—tension encoded in civilizational grammar.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Confederacy encodes **secession as polity and its procedural
absorption**—the claim that was denied by force and then terminated
by surrender and reintegration, not by revolutionary eradication.

Lessons:
• Secessionist polities can be denied legitimacy and defeated;
  union preserved by force when procedure (perpetual union) is
  asserted.
• Defeat can be procedural: surrender terms that permit
  reintegration; "countrymen again" as precedent.
• Confederate memory and Union memory coexist; Lost Cause and
  union-preservation narrative both part of American encoding;
  tension preserved without verdict.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
AMERICA:
• MEM–AMERICA–WAR–AMERICAN–CIVIL — Parent war; Confederacy as
  secessionist opponent; union preservation by force.
• MEM–AMERICA–WAR–AMERICAN–CIVIL–FORT–SUMTER — Confederacy fires
  first; war trigger; sovereignty claim becomes armed conflict.
• MEM–AMERICA–WAR–AMERICAN–CIVIL–APPOMATTOX — Procedural termination;
  Lee's surrender; Grant's terms; Confederacy dissolved through
  surrender and reintegration.
• MEM–AMERICA–WAR–AMERICAN–CIVIL–LEE — Confederacy's principal
  field commander; surrender at Appomattox; procedural choice.
• MEM–AMERICA–WAR–AMERICAN–CIVIL–STONEWALL–JACKSON — Confederacy's
  tactical instrument; irreplaceable loss; structural limit.
• MEM–AMERICA–WAR–AMERICAN–CIVIL–VICKSBURG — Confederacy split;
  material turning; western capacity severed.
• MEM–AMERICA–WAR–AMERICAN–CIVIL–GETTYSBURG — Confederate offensive
  exhausted; legitimacy inflection for Union.
• MEM–AMERICA–LINCOLN — Union president; preservation of Union;
  war against Confederacy as rebellion.
• MEM–AMERICA–GRANT — Union commander; attrition and Appomattox
  terms; defeat of Confederacy without annihilation.

Cross-Civilizational:
• MEM–ANGLIA–WAR–AMERICAN–CIVIL — Anglian encoding; same war;
  Confederacy as defeated secessionist entity in Anglian frame.

Cross-references denote lineage, not equivalence.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Confederacy: compact theory, sovereignty claim; Fort Sumter;
  Lee, Jackson, eastern theatre; Vicksburg, Gettysburg, attrition.
• Defeat procedural—Appomattox, parole, reintegration; "countrymen
  again." Union memory and Lost Cause both encoded.
• Secession denied by force; polity absorbed by procedure.

Tension preserved without verdict.
