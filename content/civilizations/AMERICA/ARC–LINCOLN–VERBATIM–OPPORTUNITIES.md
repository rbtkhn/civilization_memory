# Lincoln Verbatim Insertion Opportunities — MEM–AMERICA

**Purpose:** Identify specific places to insert **Lincoln’s own words** (primary source) as SOURCE blocks in Lincoln-relevant MEMs. No MEM–AMERICA file currently cites Lincoln himself as verbatim source.

**ARC prerequisite:** Add Lincoln as primary source under ARC-T-EARLY-MOD, e.g.:
- **Abraham Lincoln (1809–1865)** — speeches, letters, state papers; as in *The Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln*, ed. Roy P. Basler et al., 9 vols. (New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press, 1953–1955), or equivalent standard editions (as applicable for Civil War, union, emancipation, Gettysburg, inaugurals).

Cite as (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD) [ERC-PRIMARY]. Use Basler *Collected Works* volume/page or speech/date for citation line.

I do not expect the Union to be dissolved — I do not expect the house to fall — but I do expect it will cease to be divided. It will become all one thing, or all the other."

**Insert after:** Context bullets in §II, or after "Procedure becomes non-negotiable" in §III.

## Summary

| # | MEM | Section | Lincoln source (short) |
|---|-----|---------|-------------------------|
| 1 | MEM–AMERICA–PRESIDENT–LINCOLN | II or III | House Divided (1858) |
| 2 | MEM–AMERICA–PRESIDENT–LINCOLN | III | First Inaugural — perpetuity / no lawful exit |
| 3 | MEM–AMERICA–PRESIDENT–LINCOLN | V | Greeley letter — paramount object Union |
| 4 | MEM–AMERICA–PRESIDENT–LINCOLN | VI or VII | Second Inaugural — malice toward none |
| 5 | MEM–AMERICA–WAR–AMERICAN–CIVIL–GETTYSBURG | II or III | Gettysburg Address closing |
| 6 | MEM–AMERICA–WAR–AMERICAN–CIVIL–FORT–SUMTER | II or III | July 4, 1861 message — war-power in defence |

| 8 | MEM–AMERICA–WAR–AMERICAN–CIVIL–APPOMATTOX | III or IV | Second Inaugural — bind up the nation's wounds |

**Implementation order:** (1) Add Lincoln to CIV–ARC–AMERICA under ARC-T-EARLY-MOD. (2) Add SOURCE blocks in chosen MEMs using the format already used for Grant and Donald; bump MEM content versions. (3) Prefer one Lincoln verbatim per MEM in a first pass to avoid over-weighting a single voice; reuse same quote in two MEMs (e.g. First Inaugural in LINCOLN + WAR–AMERICAN–CIVIL, Second Inaugural in LINCOLN + APPOMATTOX) is consistent with existing practice.

**Note:** For the July 4, 1861 message, verify exact wording in Basler *Collected Works* Vol. 4; web summaries sometimes duplicate sentences.

**Implementation (February 2026):** Lincoln added to CIV–ARC–AMERICA (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD). All eight opportunities implemented: MEM–AMERICA–PRESIDENT–LINCOLN (4 blocks), GETTYSBURG (1), FORT–SUMTER (1), WAR–AMERICAN–CIVIL (1), APPOMATTOX (1). MEM versions bumped per CMC version decoupling.
