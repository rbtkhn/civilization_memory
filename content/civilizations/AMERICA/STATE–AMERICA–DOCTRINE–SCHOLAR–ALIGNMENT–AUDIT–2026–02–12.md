# Audit: CIV–DOCTRINE–AMERICA ↔ STATE–AMERICA & SCHOLAR–AMERICA Alignment

**Date:** 2026-02-12  
**Scope:** Alignment of CIV–DOCTRINE–AMERICA v1.0 with CIV–STATE–AMERICA v1.0 and CIV–SCHOLAR–AMERICA v1.0  
**Purpose:** Verify doctrine authority flow, citation consistency, constraint alignment, and mirroring.

---

## 1. Summary

| Dimension | STATE–AMERICA | SCHOLAR–AMERICA |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------|
| Doctrine authority declared | ✓ Aligned | ✓ Aligned |
| Citation to DOCTRINE–AMERICA | Partial (III.A, IX); Section VII still cites ANGLIA | Partial (III, XXI); XIII, XV, XVIII, XXIII need update |
| Constraint alignment | ✓ No contradiction | ✓ No contradiction |
| Mirroring (doctrine → SCHOLAR) | N/A (STATE may cite; no mirror req.) | Gap: no verbatim mirror of doctrines 01–07 |
| Source Versions / doctrine count | ✓ DOCTRINE–AMERICA v1.0 listed | ✓ Count 7 in DOCTRINE–AMERICA |

**Overall:** Authority and high-level references are aligned. Remaining work: consistent citation of CIV–DOCTRINE–AMERICA (and doctrine numbers) in STATE Section VII and in option assessments; SCHOLAR context-loading and doctrine-registry wording; optional verbatim mirror in SCHOLAR per DOCTRINE–AMERICA §V.

## 2. Doctrine ↔ STATE–AMERICA

### 2.1 Authority and source of doctrine

- **Header / State learns from Scholar:** STATE correctly states that "American doctrinal authority: CIV–DOCTRINE–AMERICA (derived from CIV–DOCTRINE–ANGLIA)." **Aligned.**
- **Section IX (Source Versions):** CIV–DOCTRINE–AMERICA v1.0 is listed as "derived from ANGLIA; American doctrine authority." **Aligned.**

### 2.2 Strategic position (Section III)

- **III.A (Legitimacy):** Cites "American doctrines (CIV–DOCTRINE–AMERICA, derived from CIV–DOCTRINE–ANGLIA)" and "CIV–DOCTRINE–AMERICA 01, 03." **Aligned.**
- **III.B (Power):** Refers to "Anglian doctrine 04 — time as weapon" and to maritime supremacy (doctrine 06). **Minor gap:** For consistency with American doctrine authority, could cite CIV–DOCTRINE–AMERICA 04 and 06.
- **III.C (Liability):** Refers to "Anglian doctrines 03, 05." **Minor gap:** Could cite CIV–DOCTRINE–AMERICA 03, 05.

### 2.3 Material options (Section IV)

- **Option A:** "Assessed against Anglian doctrines 01 (procedure as memory), 03 (defeat without collapse), 05 (coalition primacy)." **Gap:** Doctrine registry for America is CIV–DOCTRINE–AMERICA; citation should be CIV–DOCTRINE–AMERICA 01, 03, 05.
- **Option C:** "Assessed against Anglian doctrines 03 (defeat/exit without collapse), 04 (time as weapon)." **Gap:** Should cite CIV–DOCTRINE–AMERICA 03, 04.

### 2.4 Decision-relevant history (Section VII)

- All patterns cite **CIV–DOCTRINE–ANGLIA** (01, 03, 04, 05, 06) by name and number.
- **Gap:** For the American entity, the authoritative doctrine source is CIV–DOCTRINE–AMERICA (per DOCTRINE–AMERICA and STATE header). Section VII should cite CIV–DOCTRINE–AMERICA for doctrine patterns, with optional note "(derived from CIV–DOCTRINE–ANGLIA)" where useful. Doctrine 06 name in DOCTRINE–AMERICA is "Dual-Ocean Denial"; meaning matches STATE’s "Naval Denial" usage.

### 2.5 Inheritance (Section II)

- Correctly cites Anglian inheritance and CIV–DOCTRINE–ANGLIA as source of inherited doctrines. **Aligned.** Optional: add one line that American formulation is registered in CIV–DOCTRINE–AMERICA.

### 2.6 Hard constraints and rejected doctrines

- No STATE content contradicts DOCTRINE–AMERICA hard constraints (procedure, rupture, defeat, time, coalition, dual-ocean, myth).
- Rejected doctrines (PERMANENT MORAL SUPERIORITY, INEVITABLE PROGRESS) are not asserted in STATE. **Aligned.**

---

## 3. Doctrine ↔ SCHOLAR–AMERICA

### 3.1 Authority and doctrine registry

- **Section I:** CIV–DOCTRINE–AMERICA is named as "the authoritative American doctrine registry." **Aligned.**
- **Section III (RLL/Doctrine):** References "CIV–DOCTRINE–AMERICA as **authoritative American doctrine** and CIV–DOCTRINE–ANGLIA as **inherited doctrinal context** (doctrines 01–07 apply as American-adapted frame)." **Aligned.**
- **Section XXI (Doctrine Count):** "7 in CIV–DOCTRINE–AMERICA (derived from CIV–DOCTRINE–ANGLIA)." **Aligned.**

### 3.2 Context loading (Section XIII)

- **Gap:** "Doctrine and inherited learning" states "CIV–DOCTRINE–ANGLIA and CIV–SCHOLAR–ANGLIA loaded when analysing inherited grammar…" It does not state that **CIV–DOCTRINE–AMERICA** should be loaded when analysing American doctrine or America-specific synthesis. **Recommendation:** Add CIV–DOCTRINE–AMERICA to context loading for American doctrine and America-specific synthesis (with ANGLIA remaining for inherited grammar).
- On-demand list: "CIV–SCHOLAR–ANGLIA, CIV–DOCTRINE–ANGLIA, CIV–CORE–ANGLIA" — add CIV–DOCTRINE–AMERICA.

### 3.3 Initial state (Section XV)

- "Assumed structural prior… as documented in CIV–DOCTRINE–ANGLIA and CIV–SCHOLAR–ANGLIA." **Minor gap:** For America, the canonical formulation is now CIV–DOCTRINE–AMERICA. Recommend: "as documented in CIV–DOCTRINE–AMERICA (derived from CIV–DOCTRINE–ANGLIA) and CIV–SCHOLAR–ANGLIA."

### 3.4 Doctrine registry (Section XVIII)

- Text says "No America-specific doctrines frozen. Inherited context: CIV–DOCTRINE–ANGLIA (Procedure as Memory…)." **Gap:** CIV–DOCTRINE–AMERICA now holds the authoritative American doctrine set (01–07). **Recommendation:** Replace or extend with: "Authoritative American doctrine: CIV–DOCTRINE–AMERICA (doctrines 01–07, derived from CIV–DOCTRINE–ANGLIA). No additional America-specific doctrines frozen beyond the derived set."

### 3.5 Belief synthesis log (Section XVII)

- "Inherited doctrinal context: CIV–DOCTRINE–ANGLIA (doctrines 01–07)." **Optional:** Add "American formulation: CIV–DOCTRINE–AMERICA."

### 3.6 Mirroring (CIV–DOCTRINE–AMERICA §V)

- DOCTRINE–AMERICA §V: "This doctrine registry MUST be mirrored verbatim into: CIV–CORE–AMERICA (when that file exists); CIV–SCHOLAR–AMERICA."
- SCHOLAR–AMERICA does not contain the full verbatim text of doctrines 01–07 from CIV–DOCTRINE–AMERICA; it references the registry and doctrine count. **Gap (interpretation-dependent):** If "mirrored verbatim" means the doctrine definitions must appear inside SCHOLAR, then SCHOLAR should be updated to include them (e.g. in Section XVIII or a dedicated subsection). If it means SCHOLAR must not contradict and must reference the single source of truth, current reference is sufficient but Section XVIII wording should be updated as in 3.4.

### 3.7 Versioning (Section XXIII)

- "No America-specific doctrines" is outdated. **Gap:** Update to "America-specific doctrines: 7 in CIV–DOCTRINE–AMERICA (derived from CIV–DOCTRINE–ANGLIA)."

---

## 4. Cross-cutting checks

### 4.1 Doctrine numbering and names

- STATE and SCHOLAR use doctrine numbers 01–07 and concepts (procedure, defeat without collapse, time, coalition, naval/dual-ocean, myth). DOCTRINE–AMERICA uses the same numbering; only doctrine 06 is renamed to "Dual-Ocean Denial" (from "Naval Denial"). **Aligned**; STATE/SCHOLAR can continue using "naval" in prose; citation should point to CIV–DOCTRINE–AMERICA 06.

### 4.2 Compatibility statement

- DOCTRINE–AMERICA header: "Compatibility: CIV–MEM–CORE v3.0 · CIV–STATE–AMERICA v1.0 · CIV–SCHOLAR–AMERICA v1.0." **Aligned** with current STATE and SCHOLAR versions.

### 4.3 Citation rules (DOCTRINE–AMERICA §VI)

- "CIV–CORE–AMERICA (when present) and CIV–STATE–AMERICA may cite: Doctrine Name, Version, Doctrine Number." STATE does not yet consistently cite by doctrine number in Section VII and in option assessments; see 2.3 and 2.4. **Recommendation:** Where doctrine is cited, use "CIV–DOCTRINE–AMERICA [number] ([name])" as the standard.

## 5. Recommended changes (concise)

| File | Location | Change |
|------|----------|--------|
| CIV–STATE–AMERICA | § III.B | Add citation to CIV–DOCTRINE–AMERICA 04, 06 where doctrine is invoked. |
| CIV–STATE–AMERICA | § III.C | Cite CIV–DOCTRINE–AMERICA 03, 05 instead of or in addition to Anglian. |
| CIV–STATE–AMERICA | § IV Option A | Cite CIV–DOCTRINE–AMERICA 01, 03, 05. |
| CIV–STATE–AMERICA | § IV Option C | Cite CIV–DOCTRINE–AMERICA 03, 04. |
| CIV–STATE–AMERICA | § VII (all patterns) | Cite CIV–DOCTRINE–AMERICA with doctrine number; optional "(derived from CIV–DOCTRINE–ANGLIA)". |
| CIV–SCHOLAR–AMERICA | § XIII | Add CIV–DOCTRINE–AMERICA to doctrine/context loading and on-demand list. |
| CIV–SCHOLAR–AMERICA | § XV | Add "American formulation: CIV–DOCTRINE–AMERICA (derived from ANGLIA)." |
| CIV–SCHOLAR–AMERICA | § XVII | Optionally add "American formulation: CIV–DOCTRINE–AMERICA." |
| CIV–SCHOLAR–AMERICA | § XVIII | Replace "No America-specific doctrines frozen" with authoritative reference to CIV–DOCTRINE–AMERICA (doctrines 01–07). |
| CIV–SCHOLAR–AMERICA | § XXIII | Update versioning note to state doctrines 01–07 in CIV–DOCTRINE–AMERICA. |
| CIV–SCHOLAR–AMERICA | § XVIII (optional) | If verbatim mirror is required, add subsection with doctrine names and definitions from DOCTRINE–AMERICA. |

---

## 6. Conclusion

Doctrine authority is correctly assigned to CIV–DOCTRINE–AMERICA in both STATE and SCHOLAR, and there are no substantive conflicts with the seven doctrines or their constraints. Remaining work is **citation and wording consistency**: prefer CIV–DOCTRINE–AMERICA (and doctrine numbers) wherever American doctrine is cited, and update SCHOLAR’s context-loading, doctrine-registry, and versioning sections to reflect the existence and role of CIV–DOCTRINE–AMERICA. Verbatim mirroring of doctrines 01–07 into SCHOLAR is optional unless governance requires an embedded copy.
