I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves the **Declaration of Independence** (4 July 1776)
as the document that **publicly allocated liability** for rupture: the
Continental Congress declared the colonies free and independent and
the signers **pledged** their lives, fortunes, and honor to the cause.
From a liability perspective: the Declaration does not create jurisdiction
by itself—it **asserts** it and **binds** the signers. **Who is on the
hook?** The signers (treason if Britain won); the "people" in whose
name they act; the colonies that had authorized their delegates to
vote for independence. **Mechanism**: the text is a **public commitment**
—irrevocable once published; defection after signing is betrayal of
the pledge. **Institutional survival** of the new polity depends on
the Declaration's legitimacy as the founding act and on the war
securing what it declared.

**Scholar scope:** For this **constitutive** commitment, reversal
(defection) is encoded as betrayal; the option was at the moment of
signing (sign or not sign). ENTRY 0010/0011 (CIV–SCHOLAR–AMERICA) apply
to **operational** commitments, where accommodation/reversal can be a
briefed, legitimate option.

The republican principle Adams held while on the committee—**government
of laws, not of men**—appears in his *Thoughts on Government* (1776)
and later in the Massachusetts Constitution (1780), which he drafted:

SOURCE — Adams, Massachusetts Constitution, Part I, Art. XXX (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD):
> "In the government of this Commonwealth, the legislative department shall never exercise the executive and judicial powers, or either of them: The executive shall never exercise the legislative and judicial powers, or either of them: The judicial shall never exercise the legislative and executive powers, or either of them: to the end it may be a government of laws and not of men."
> — Massachusetts Constitution, Part the First, Art. XXX (1780), in *The Works of John Adams*, ed. Charles Francis Adams, vol. 4 (Boston: Little, Brown, 1851), 259 (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD) [ERC-PRIMARY].

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

II. ADOPTION — CONGRESS AND JEFFERSON
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Second Continental Congress, meeting in Philadelphia, voted for
independence; a committee (Jefferson, Adams, Franklin, Sherman,
Livingston) drafted the document; Jefferson was the principal author.
Congress edited the draft (e.g. deletion of the slavery grievance);
the Declaration was adopted 4 July 1776 and signed over the following
months. **Jurisdiction**: the Congress had no prior legal authority
to declare the colonies independent; it **claimed** that authority
by right of the people and the necessity of the case. **Who bore
the cost** of the document? The signers—their names made them
targets for British retaliation and bound them to the cause.

Jefferson, in his Autobiography, on drafting and reporting to Congress:

SOURCE — Jefferson, Autobiography (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD):
> "The committee for drawing the declaration of Independence desired me to do it. It was accordingly done, and being approved by them, I reported it to the house on Friday the 28th of June when it was read and ordered to lie on the table."
> — Thomas Jefferson, Autobiography, in *The Works of Thomas Jefferson*, ed. Paul Leicester Ford, vol. 1 (New York: G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1904) (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD) [ERC-PRIMARY].

Paine, in *Common Sense* (Feb. 1776), had already framed custom as
obstacle and time as the converter that made independence thinkable:

SOURCE — Paine, *Common Sense* (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD):
> "Perhaps the sentiments contained in the following pages, are not yet sufficiently fashionable to procure them general favor; a long habit of not thinking a thing wrong, gives it a superficial appearance of being right, and raises at first a formidable outcry in defence of custom. But the tumult soon subsides. Time makes more converts than reason."
> — Thomas Paine, *Common Sense* (Philadelphia, 14 Feb. 1776) (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD) [ERC-PRIMARY].

III. PRIMARY TEXT — OPENING AND SELF-EVIDENT TRUTHS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Declaration opens with the right of a people to dissolve political
bands and assumes the "separate and equal station" to which the "Laws
of Nature and of Nature's God" entitle them. It then states the
universal claims that justify the break:

SOURCE — Declaration of Independence (1776) (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD):
> "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.—That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed,—That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government."
> — Declaration of Independence, 4 July 1776 (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD) [ERC-PRIMARY].

**Liability mechanism**: the "people" hold the right to alter or
abolish government; the Congress acts in their name. The Crown and
Parliament are indicted for repeated injuries and usurpations; the
colonies are "absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown."
**Who is on the hook** for the new allegiance? The signers and the
states they represent—the pledge makes that explicit.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. THE PLEDGE — LIVES, FORTUNES, SACRED HONOR
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The closing sentence binds the signers personally:

SOURCE — Declaration of Independence (1776) (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD):
> "And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor."
> — Declaration of Independence, 4 July 1776 (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD) [ERC-PRIMARY].

**Personal liability**: each signer commits to the others and to the
cause; defection (recanting, siding with Britain) would break the
pledge and expose the defector to condemnation. **Institutional
survival** of the Declaration as founding text depends on the war
being won—so that the pledge is not tested by defeat and the document
stands as the **legitimacy anchor** for the new republic.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Declaration encodes **rupture as public commitment**: universal
rights language, indictment of the Crown, and a **pledge** that
allocates liability to the signers. It does not create the army or
the government; it **declares** the colonies free and **binds** the
Congress and the signers to that declaration. Restraint is absent—
this is the moment of break, not of structure. The Constitution (1787)
and the Bill of Rights (1791) later **limit** the government the
Declaration made thinkable; the Declaration itself is the **mechanism**
of public, irrevocable rupture.

• Universal rights language; consent of governed; right to alter or abolish.
• Public commitment makes defection after signing a betrayal.
• Jefferson principal author; Congress adopted and edited; 4 July 1776.
• Institutional survival of Declaration as founding text depends on victory in war.

Tension preserved without verdict.
