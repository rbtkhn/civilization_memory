I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves Harry S. Truman as **America's succession
president and containment architect**: the figure who inherited
the wartime presidency on Roosevelt's death (April 1945), oversaw
war termination (Potsdam, atomic use, surrender), and then
launched Cold War doctrine—Truman Doctrine, Marshall Plan, NATO,
Berlin Airlift, Korea—while enforcing civilian supremacy (MacArthur
removal) and framing accountability ("The buck stops here").

Truman does not found the Cold War alone.
He **inherits** victory and **declares** containment; procedure
holds through sudden succession and through removal of the
recalcitrant general.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. ORIGIN & STYLE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Truman assumes the presidency by succession, not election.

Context:
• Vice President (1945); FDR death (April 1945); Truman in office
  weeks before V-E Day; Potsdam (July 1945); atomic decision;
  V-J Day and Japanese surrender
• "The buck stops here"—legitimacy framed as personal accountability
  and decision; procedure (succession) delivers authority to the
  unprepared successor
• No prior foreign-policy prominence; learning on the job; institutional
  continuity (Cabinet, military, alliance) carries the transition

Authority is framed as **constitutional and accountable**: the
president who did not choose the moment but who accepted the
office and the decisions (atomic use, containment, Korea, MacArthur).

Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., in *The Imperial Presidency* (1973), on
the shift of power that Truman's tenure exemplified:

SOURCE — Schlesinger Jr., *The Imperial Presidency* (ARC-T-MODERN):
> "The new American approach to world affairs, nurtured in the sense of omnipresent crisis, set new political objectives, developed new military capabilities, devised new diplomatic techniques, invented new instruments of foreign operations and instituted a new hierarchy of values. Every one of these innovations encouraged the displacement of power, both practical and constitutional, from an increasingly acquiescent Congress into an increasingly imperial Presidency."
> — Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., *The Imperial Presidency* (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1973) (ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-SECONDARY].

III. WAR TERMINATION: ATOMIC USE & SURRENDER
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Truman presides over the end of the Second World War.

Sequence:
• Potsdam (July 1945)—demand for unconditional surrender; Soviet
  entry into Pacific war imminent
• Atomic bombs (Hiroshima, August 6; Nagasaki, August 9); Japanese
  surrender (August 15); occupation and constitutional reform
• Decision encoded as **war termination**—shorten conflict, avoid
  invasion, secure surrender; moral and strategic debate preserved
  in memory without synthesis

War ends under Truman's authority. Procedure (commander-in-chief,
succession) places the decision in the president's hands; the
republic absorbs the outcome and the controversy.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. TRUMAN DOCTRINE, MARSHALL PLAN, NATO
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Truman launches declarative Cold War structure.

Elements:
• Truman Doctrine (1947)—"support free peoples resisting attempted
  subjugation"; containment as declarative policy; Greece and
  Turkey as first application
• Marshall Plan (1948)—European recovery; economic investment as
  coalition and stability tool; procedure (appropriation, administration)
  as instrument of order
• Berlin Airlift (1948–1949)—Soviet blockade; Western supply by air;
  no escalation to ground conflict; procedure (alliance, logistics)
  as response to coercion
• NATO (1949)—binding collective defence; U.S. commitment to
  European security; Atlantic alliance as extension of procedural
  order

Containment is **declarative and institutional**: doctrine (Truman
Doctrine), money (Marshall Plan), and treaty (NATO) frame the
perimeter. The president who inherited war **declares** the peacetime
contest.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. KOREA & MACARTHUR REMOVAL
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Truman commits to limited war and enforces civilian control.

Sequence:
• North Korean invasion (June 1950); U.S. and UN response; "police
  action"—commitment without formal congressional declaration of war
• MacArthur's advance to Yalu; Chinese intervention; MacArthur
  advocates expansion (bombing China, possibly nuclear); public
  disagreement with Truman policy
• Truman relieves MacArthur (April 1951)—civilian control of military;
  procedure (president as commander-in-chief) over the popular general
• Stalemate and armistice negotiations; war continues under Truman's
  successor (Eisenhower); Truman's encoding: **limited war and
  civilian supremacy**

The removal encodes **procedure over personality**: the president
fires the hero-general when the general challenges policy. Washington's
precedent (civilian control) is reaffirmed; the republic does not
yield strategy to the theatre commander.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Truman encodes **succession under shock, containment launch, and
civilian supremacy**.

Lessons:
• Procedure holds through sudden succession; the vice president
  becomes president; war and doctrine continue under the successor;
  legitimacy derives from office, not preparation.
• War termination can be decided by the successor president;
  atomic use as decision under Truman's authority; debate preserved.
• Containment can be launched declaratively—doctrine, aid, alliance;
  Truman Doctrine and Marshall Plan as signals before full deployment;
  NATO as binding procedure.
• Civilian control is enforced by removal; MacArthur's firing
  reaffirms that the president sets policy and the general obeys;
  procedure over popularity.
• Limited war (Korea) can be waged without formal declaration;
  "police action" and UN mandate as procedural frame; outcome
  (stalemate, armistice) encoded separately.

Truman is America's **succession president and containment
founder**: FDR's heir, atomic decider, doctrine declarer, and
the president who fired MacArthur.

VII. MEM CONNECTIONS (MANDATORY)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
AMERICA:
• MEM–AMERICA–ROOSEVELT–FRANKLIN — Succession on FDR's death (1945);
  Truman inherits war and coalition; procedure holds; contrast in
  tenure (FDR four terms, Truman elected once in own right).
• MEM–AMERICA–EISENHOWER — Supreme Commander under Truman; Korea
  armistice under Eisenhower presidency; Ike as Truman's successor's
  successor; containment continuity.
• MEM–AMERICA–KENNEDY — Containment continuity; Truman Doctrine
  and NATO as foundation for Kennedy's crisis management.
• MEM–AMERICA–WASHINGTON — Civilian control; Truman's MacArthur
  removal as reaffirmation of president over general; precedent
  from founding.
• MEM–AMERICA–JACKSON — Executive vs. defiant authority; Jackson's
  removals and confrontations; Truman's firing of MacArthur—procedure
  and office over popular figure.
• MEM–AMERICA–MACARTHUR — Theatre commander relieved by Truman
  (April 1951); Korea policy clash; civilian supremacy; encoding
  from general's perspective.
• MEM–AMERICA–MONROE — Doctrine as declarative; Monroe Doctrine
  as hemisphere perimeter; Truman Doctrine as containment perimeter;
  declarative precedent.
• MEM–AMERICA–LINCOLN — Crisis succession; Lincoln's war presidency;
  Truman's inheritance of war and launch of Cold War; legitimacy
  under stress.
• MEM–AMERICA–GRANT — War termination; Grant's Appomattox; Truman's
  surrender and occupation; procedure for ending war.

Cross-references denote lineage, not equivalence.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VIII. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Succession under shock (FDR death) holds; procedure delivers
  authority; decisions (atomic, containment) follow.
• Containment launched declaratively—doctrine, aid, treaty—before
  full mobilisation; Monroe-era pattern (declare then build).
• Civilian supremacy enforced by removal; MacArthur as precedent;
  president over general.
• Limited war (Korea) without formal declaration; procedure
  (UN, police action) frames commitment.
• Truman is FDR's heir and containment's declarer; Eisenhower
  consolidates what Truman launched.

Tension preserved without verdict.
