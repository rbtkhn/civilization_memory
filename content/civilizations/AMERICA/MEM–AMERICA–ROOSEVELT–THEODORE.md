────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves Theodore Roosevelt as **America's executive
energizer and hemispheric projector**: the figure who fused personal
vigour with institutional assertion—"big stick" diplomacy, canal
ambition, trust-busting, conservation—and who stretched the
presidency as bully pulpit without abandoning procedural form.

Roosevelt does not break the republic.
He **amplifies** it—at home through regulated capitalism and public
land, abroad through declared hemispheric interest and naval display.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. ORIGIN & STYLE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Roosevelt enters national politics as reformer and martial figure.

Context:
• New York Assembly; Civil Service Commission; Navy Department
• Rough Riders (1898)—Spanish–American War; San Juan Hill
• Governor of New York; Vice President; succession after McKinley (1901)

Authority is framed as **energy and example**: the president as
active steward, not passive executor. Strenuous life; moral and
physical vigour as legitimacy signal.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. DOMESTIC: SQUARE DEAL, TRUSTS, CONSERVATION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Roosevelt uses federal power to moderate industrial concentration
and reserve public domain.

Policies:
• Trust-busting (Northern Securities; Standard Oil trajectory)—
  regulation and dissolution, not laissez-faire
• Square Deal—fair play for capital, labour, and public
• Conservation—national parks, forests, reclamation; state as
  permanent trustee of land and resources

The executive **mediates** between concentrated private power and
public interest. Procedure expands to absorb economic conflict.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. HEMISPHERIC & NAVAL PROJECTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Roosevelt territorializes Monroe-era doctrine with capacity.

Elements:
• "Speak softly and carry a big stick"—signal and capability
• Roosevelt Corollary (1904)—U.S. as hemispheric policeman;
  preventive intervention to forestall European intervention
• Panama Canal—support for separation from Colombia; canal zone;
  Atlantic–Pacific link as strategic fact

Doctrine is **enforced** as well as declared. The hemisphere is
claimed as sphere of management, not only of non-colonization.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. PRESIDENCY AS BULLY PULPIT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Roosevelt treats the office as platform for moral and policy leadership.

Patterns:
• Public persuasion; press and rhetoric as tools
• Legislative pressure; executive initiative
• Personal example (strenuous life, family, travel)

Legitimacy derives from **activity**—visible, continuous, framed
as stewardship. The president is not merely executor of Congress;
he leads opinion and shapes agenda.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. BULL MOOSE & THIRD-TERM TENSION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Roosevelt's return in 1912 fractures the Republican coalition.

Sequence:
• Break with Taft; Progressive (Bull Moose) candidacy
• Second-place popular vote; Taft and Roosevelt split Republican
  vote; Wilson wins
• Two-term precedent strained but not yet codified; Roosevelt
  had declined run in 1908, then sought return in 1912

Procedure absorbs the rupture; the system produces a Democratic
president. Personal ambition is **contained** by electoral outcome.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Theodore Roosevelt encodes **executive energy and hemispheric
assertion**.

Lessons:
• The presidency can be used as bully pulpit without discarding
  constitutional form.
• Domestic regulation and conservation extend state stewardship
  over economy and land.
• Hemisphere doctrine (Monroe) can be upgraded to corollary—
  preventive intervention, canal, naval display—when capacity
  and will align.
• Personal vigour and public example become legitimacy resources;
  they also create succession tension when the figure seeks return.

Roosevelt is America's **active steward**: same procedural frame,
amplified executive role.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VIII. MEM CONNECTIONS (MANDATORY)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
AMERICA:
• MEM–AMERICA–MONROE — Monroe Doctrine as baseline; Roosevelt
  Corollary as extension; hemisphere as sphere of management.
• MEM–AMERICA–ADAMS–QUINCY — Doctrine-drafting precedent;
  Roosevelt as doctrine-extender (corollary) and enforcer.
• MEM–AMERICA–JACKSON — Executive personalization; Roosevelt
  as energy without Jackson's anti-institutional hostility;
  contrast in style and institutional outcome.
• MEM–AMERICA–LINCOLN — Crisis presidency; executive stretch;
  Roosevelt in peacetime amplifies without Lincoln's existential
  emergency.

ANGLIA (where not yet migrated):
• MEM–ANGLIA–WAR–SPANISH–AMERICAN — Roosevelt as Rough Rider;
  war as springboard to national prominence and then presidency.
• MEM–ANGLIA–GEO–SUEZ–CANAL — Canal precedent; Panama as
  American Suez (chokepoint, control without sovereignty of
  host state in full).

Cross-references denote lineage, not equivalence.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IX. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Executive energy can expand legitimacy without abandoning procedure.
• Hemisphere doctrine gains a corollary when capacity and will align.
• Trust-busting and conservation extend state as mediator and trustee.
• Personal return (1912) fractures coalition; procedure contains outcome.
• Theodore Roosevelt is Monroe plus stick, Jackson's energy with
  institutional loyalty.

Tension preserved without verdict.
