This file learns from the present — analysing current events through
historically-grounded patterns to provide structured decision-relevant
options. It is informed by CIV–SCHOLAR–AMERICA (which learns from the past
and treats pre-America Anglian culture and history as core to U.S. history
and present), and by CIV–SCHOLAR–ANGLIA and the ANGLIA MEM corpus as
constitutive source. Information does not feed back into Scholar except
via explicit harvest.

Duty of Competence: This file is subject to a completeness standard.
The system's obligation is to surface all material options identifiable
through the application of three analytical perspectives: legitimacy
and institutional continuity; power distribution and structural
constraint; and leadership liability and mechanism. Failure to apply
any perspective constitutes a completeness violation.

State learns from Scholar: The historically-grounded patterns and
constraint grammar accumulated in CIV–SCHOLAR–AMERICA (and its
constitutive sources, CIV–SCHOLAR–ANGLIA and CIV–DOCTRINE–ANGLIA)
inform this file. American doctrinal authority: CIV–DOCTRINE–AMERICA
(derived from CIV–DOCTRINE–ANGLIA). Information flows from STATE into Scholar only via
explicit **harvest** or **harvest session** command (CIV–STATE–TEMPLATE
§XIV-B). The system equips; the principal decides. Accountability
lives with the choice, not the analysis.

I. ENTITY IDENTIFICATION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Name: United States of America / United States / USA / America
Classification: STANDARD-STATE
Active: YES
Capital: Washington, D.C.
Date of establishment: 1776
Current State Form: Federal republic (1789–present)

The United States is a standard state with heritage links to Anglian
(British) institutional and cultural inheritance. It does not claim
civilizational-state status; it claims continuity of procedural and
constitutional order from the founding. The entity is framed here as
**Western Hemisphere hegemon**: militarily dominant across the hemisphere,
with varying degrees of political influence and control in Latin America.

Phase history (operational):
1. Colonial period (British North America, to 1776)
2. Revolutionary era (1776–1823) — **state established 1776**; ends with Monroe Doctrine
3. Continental expansion (1823–1898) — **Monroe Doctrine 1823**; expansion pre-1898
4. Global expansion (1898–1945) — expansion post-1898; hemispheric and extra-hemispheric projection
5. Global heir to British Empire (1945–1991) — **official inheritance of the British Empire 1945**
6. Unipolar hegemon era (1991–present) — **unipolar hegemon from 1991**

Persistent patterns drawn from Anglian inheritance and U.S. experience:
• Procedure and precedent as sources of legitimacy (written constitution,
  common law, institutional continuity)
• Hegemony expressed as order rather than formal empire (Monroe Doctrine,
  perimeter control, declarative restraint)
• Military dominance as structural fact in the hemisphere; political
  influence varies by subregion and regime
• Tension between intervention and restraint in Latin America; between
  hemisphere focus and extra-hemispheric commitments

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. SUCCESSION AND INHERITANCE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

FROM ANGLIA / BRITISH NORTH AMERICA:

Type: INSTITUTIONAL_TRANSFER, CULTURAL_INHERITANCE, DIRECT_CONTINUATION
  (13 colonies → United States)

Inherited (per MEM–ANGLIA–UNITED–STATES–AMERICA, MEM–ANGLIA–WAR–AMERICAN–
INDEPENDENCE–YORKTOWN, CIV–SCHOLAR–ANGLIA, CIV–DOCTRINE–ANGLIA):
• Common law reasoning and precedent-based legitimacy
• Representative assemblies and procedural constraint on executive authority
• Protestant moral individualism and suspicion of standing arbitrary power
• Maritime and later dual-ocean strategic orientation (Atlantic, Pacific)
• Procedural exit as survival mechanism (British exit at Yorktown encoded
  without legitimacy collapse; Canada’s autonomy without military rupture)
• Coalition primacy and time as strategic weapon (Anglian doctrines 04, 05)
• Naval denial and sea control as existential defence (Anglian doctrine 06)

Break:
• Crown sovereignty and imperial hierarchy rejected at independence
• Written constitution and codified federalism formalise what Anglia
  leaves implicit (MEM–ANGLIA–LAW–FEDERALIST–PAPERS, MEM–ANGLIA–
  DECLARATION–INDEPENDENCE)

OFFICIAL INHERITANCE OF THE BRITISH EMPIRE (1945):
  Date: 1945
  Type: INSTITUTIONAL_TRANSFER; succession to global primacy
  The year 1945 is the **official inheritance** of the British Empire by
  the United States: post–Second World War transition to U.S.-led alliance
  structure, reserve-currency role (Bretton Woods), and assumption of
  global security and economic leadership that Britain could no longer
  sustain. The inheritance is institutional and strategic, not territorial
  annexation; it completes the shift from Anglian to American primacy in
  the Anglosphere and in the Western-led order.

UNIPOLAR HEGEMON ERA (1991):
  Date: 1991
  Type: Structural shift (no peer competitor)
  The year **1991** begins the **STATE–AMERICA unipolar hegemon era**:
  collapse of the Soviet Union removes the only peer competitor; the
  United States operates as the sole superpower with no system-level
  balancer. Hemisphere hegemony and global inheritance (1945) persist,
  now under unipolar structural conditions.

Contested claims:
• None that materially affect U.S. self-conception as hemisphere hegemon.
  Succession from Anglia is acknowledged on both sides; the U.S. is
  understood in the MEM corpus as "Anglia unbound by island constraints"
  (MEM–ANGLIA–UNITED–STATES–AMERICA).

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. STRATEGIC POSITION (THREE PERSPECTIVES)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

A) LEGITIMACY AND INSTITUTIONAL CONTINUITY
────────────────────────────────────────────

U.S. hegemony in the Western Hemisphere rests on a mix of institutional
continuity, procedural legitimacy, and narrative of order rather than
empire. Legitimacy is sustained domestically by constitutional continuity
and by the claim that U.S. primacy underwrites stability and sovereign
norms (e.g. no new European colonisation, non-interference norm in Monroe
tradition). The hemisphere is framed as a zone of order — rules, alliances,
and institutions — not as a formal territorial empire.

Current legitimacy structure:
• Domestic: Constitutional order, separation of powers, and procedural
  succession remain intact. Legitimacy stress arises from polarisation,
  institutional friction, and contested narratives about the role of
  government and the use of force abroad.
• Hemispheric: Hegemony is justified as providing public goods (security,
  stability, dispute resolution) and as upholding sovereignty norms.
  Tension persists between the legitimacy of influence (order, alliances)
  and the sovereignty of Latin American states (non-intervention, self-
  determination). Interventions and regime support can undermine
  legitimacy if framed as imperial or arbitrary.

Key legitimacy vulnerabilities:
• Any pattern of intervention that cannot be framed as procedural or
  alliance-based risks eroding the "order not empire" narrative.
• Domestic divisions over the cost and purpose of hegemony can constrain
  the willingness to sustain commitments.
• Latin American alignment or defection is partly a function of perceived
  legitimacy of U.S. conduct; overreach or inconsistency damages both
  influence and narrative.

Historical precedent: American doctrines (CIV–DOCTRINE–AMERICA, derived
from CIV–DOCTRINE–ANGLIA) emphasise procedure as civilizational memory,
defeat without legitimacy collapse when exit is procedural, and coalition
primacy. The U.S. applies this grammar: legitimacy survives retreat or
recalibration when it is institutionally encoded rather than personalised.

B) POWER DISTRIBUTION AND STRUCTURAL CONSTRAINT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────

The United States militarily dominates the Western Hemisphere. No peer
rival holds comparable conventional force projection, basing, or
alliance integration in the Americas. Structural constraints operate
nevertheless: extra-hemispheric powers (e.g. China, Russia) can project
influence through economic, diplomatic, and limited military means;
Latin American states vary in alignment and capacity to resist or
accommodate U.S. preferences; and domestic resource constraints and
political cycles limit the sustainability of maximal commitment.

Current power-distribution assessment:
• Conventional military primacy in the hemisphere is undisputed; naval and
  air dominance support both deterrence and intervention capacity.
• Political influence in Latin America is uneven — strong in some
  capitals and institutions, weak or contested in others; subregional
  variation is the norm.
• Extra-hemispheric competition: China’s economic and infrastructure
  presence and Russia’s diplomatic and military ties in the hemisphere
  are secondary to U.S. military dominance but affect political alignment
  and leverage.
• Domestic fiscal and political constraints bind: defence and foreign
  policy compete with other priorities; electoral and attention cycles
  affect consistency of commitment.

Structural constraints:
• Hegemony is sustainable only while the cost of maintaining it remains
  politically absorbable and while key partners and clients do not
  collectively defect. Historical pattern: prolonged overreach without
  exit mechanism converts success into exhaustion (MEM–ANGLIA–WAR–
  HUNDRED–YEARS; Anglian doctrine 04 — time as weapon can favour or
  punish depending on fiscal and coalition durability).
• Naval and maritime control remain the backbone of hemisphere dominance
  (MEM–AMERICA–GEO–ATLANTIC, MEM–ANGLIA–WAR–NELSON–TRAFALGAR). Loss of
  maritime supremacy in the Atlantic or Pacific would structurally
  undermine the hegemony thesis; no such loss is currently in view.

C) LEADERSHIP LIABILITY AND MECHANISM
────────────────────────────────────────

Exposure falls on elected leaders, agencies, and institutions that
authorise or execute hemisphere policy. Mechanism assessment focuses
on who bears responsibility for intervention outcomes, pullback,
alliance management, and domestic blowback. Personalist concentration
is lower than in autocratic systems, but accountability is still
channeled through specific offices and individuals.

Current liability structure:
• Presidential authority over use of force and diplomacy creates
  concentration of exposure for major interventions or withdrawals.
• Congress and courts can constrain or legitimise action; institutional
  conflict over war powers and oversight distributes and sometimes
  diffuses liability.
• Bureaucratic and military leadership bear operational exposure;
  failure or overreach can be attributed to agencies or to political
  principals depending on narrative and procedure.

Mechanism assessment:
• Interventions that produce costly or morally contested outcomes
  (casualties, blowback, regime collapse) increase liability exposure
  for the administration that authorised them. Historical pattern:
  procedural exit and coalition sharing of burden reduce domestic
  exposure (Anglian doctrines 03, 05).
• Who benefits from policy failure (e.g. rivals, domestic opponents)
  and who is "on the hook" for reversal (e.g. pullback framed as
  defeat) are liability variables that can diverge from structural
  or legitimacy logic.

TENSIONS BETWEEN PERSPECTIVES (preserved, not resolved):

1. Legitimacy vs Power: The legitimacy perspective emphasises order,
   procedure, and narrative sustainability. The power perspective
   emphasises force ratios, alliance cohesion, and the cost of
   dominance. These can pull in opposite directions — e.g. an
   intervention that strengthens structural position may damage
   legitimacy; restraint that preserves narrative may allow rivals
   to gain influence.

2. Power vs Liability: The power perspective treats the state as the
   unit of analysis. The liability perspective asks who bears exposure
   for failure or reversal. Political leaders may choose options that
   reduce personal or institutional liability at the cost of structural
   optimality (e.g. premature exit, or avoidance of necessary but
   costly action).

3. Legitimacy vs Liability: Institutional continuity favours procedures
   that outlast any single administration. Liability focuses on
   who is exposed in the short term. Tension appears when legacy
   commitments create exposure for current officeholders.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. MATERIAL OPTIONS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

OPTION A: Maintain Hegemony Through Procedural Order

  Grounded in: Legitimacy and institutional continuity; power
  distribution (coalition and institutionalisation)

  Reasoning: The U.S. sustains hemisphere primacy by reinforcing
  order rather than raw coercion: alliances (OAS, bilateral
  partnerships), norms (sovereignty, non-intervention where
  declaratively possible), and institutional and economic integration.
  Military dominance underwrites the order but is not the primary
  day-to-day tool. This path assumes that procedural legitimacy and
  coalition durability extend the sustainability of hegemony and
  reduce the cost of maintaining it. Historical pattern: Monroe
  declared a perimeter before the U.S. had full capacity to enforce
  it; Britain’s navy underwrote it (MEM–AMERICA–MONROE). Procedure and
  declaration can substitute for constant application of force.

  Key Assumptions:
  • Key Latin American states and institutions continue to accept
    U.S.-led order as legitimate or at least tolerable — Linchpin: YES
  • Domestic political support for alliance and institutional
    commitment holds — Linchpin: YES
  • Extra-hemispheric rivals cannot offer a credible alternative
    order at scale — Linchpin: YES
  • No single crisis forces a binary choice between full intervention
    and full retreat — Linchpin: NO

  Confidence: MODERATE
  Assessed against Anglian doctrines 01 (procedure as memory), 03
  (defeat without collapse), 05 (coalition primacy) and two historical
  precedents (Monroe Doctrine as declarative order; post-1945
  hemisphere institutionalisation). Binding constraint: continued
  acceptance of U.S.-led order by a critical mass of hemisphere
  states and elites — if defection or contestation passes a threshold,
  procedural order collapses and the option fails.

  Risks: Free-riding or bandwagoning with rivals if U.S. commitment
  is perceived as weak; legitimacy erosion if order is seen as
  cover for unilateral intervention; coalition fracture under
  domestic or external stress.

  Conditions for success: Alliances and institutions function;
  norms are generally observed; U.S. avoids interventions that
  cannot be framed as procedural or collective; domestic support
  for engagement holds.

  Conditions for failure: Major Latin American states or subregions
  align against U.S. order; domestic political withdrawal from
  hemisphere commitment; a crisis forces a choice that exposes
  order as dependent on raw force alone.

  Discriminating evidence:
  • Watch for: OAS and bilateral alignment on key votes; rhetoric
    from regional leaders on U.S. role; levels of economic and
    security cooperation
  • Signal of failure: Open rejection of U.S. leadership by multiple
    major states; institutional exit or bypass (e.g. new regional
    bodies excluding the U.S.)

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

OPTION B: Deepen Political-Military Footprint in Latin America

  Grounded in: Power distribution and structural constraint

  Reasoning: Where political influence is currently weak or contested,
  the U.S. could deliberately deepen security cooperation, conditional
  aid, and (where necessary) limited intervention to align key states
  more closely with U.S. preferences and to deny space to extra-
  hemispheric rivals. This path accepts higher cost and higher
  legitimacy risk in exchange for stronger structural position.
  Historical pattern: Spanish-American War and Mexican-American War
  expanded U.S. territorial and political reach (MEM–ANGLIA–WAR–
  SPANISH–AMERICAN, MEM–ANGLIA–WAR–MEXICAN–AMERICAN). The precedent
  is that force and territorial or political reordering can lock in
  gains — but also that overreach and prolonged commitment without
  exit mechanism produce exhaustion (MEM–ANGLIA–WAR–HUNDRED–YEARS).

  Key Assumptions:
  • Additional commitment produces net alignment gain rather than
    backlash — Linchpin: YES
  • Domestic politics tolerates the cost and visibility of deeper
    engagement — Linchpin: YES
  • Target states or subregions are susceptible to U.S. leverage
    — Linchpin: NO
  • Rivals cannot offset U.S. leverage at acceptable cost to them
    — Linchpin: NO

  Confidence: LOW
  Assessed against power-distribution logic and three historical
  precedents (Spanish-American War, Mexican-American War, Cold War
  interventions in Latin America). Binding constraint: whether
  target populations and elites accept or resist deeper U.S.
  footprint — resistance can manifest as political backlash,
  alignment with rivals, or insurgency, and is largely outside
  U.S. control. Included because the power perspective identifies
  this as a material path; omission would be a completeness
  violation.

  Risks: Blowback; legitimacy damage to "order not empire" narrative;
  entanglement in conflicts that drain resources and attention;
  rally effects favouring rivals or anti-U.S. coalitions.

  Conditions for success: Leverage is applied where local conditions
  are receptive; interventions are limited and exit is planned;
  domestic and partner support holds.

  Conditions for failure: Prolonged engagement without clear exit;
  local resistance or rival counter-mobilisation; domestic
  withdrawal of support after costly failure.

  Discriminating evidence:
  • Watch for: Public opinion and elite rhetoric in target states;
    levels of cooperation with U.S. security initiatives; rival
    inroads (e.g. Chinese infrastructure, Russian diplomacy)
  • Signal of failure: Widespread protest or regime change against
    U.S.-aligned governments; formal alignment pacts excluding
    or opposing the U.S.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

OPTION C: Lighten Footprint and Prioritise Extra-Hemispheric Competition

  Grounded in: Leadership liability and mechanism; power distribution
  (resource allocation)

  Reasoning: The U.S. could consciously reduce the intensity of
  political-military commitment in the hemisphere — accepting
  greater variation in alignment and influence — and reallocate
  attention and resources to extra-hemispheric priorities (e.g.
  China, Europe, Middle East). This path trades some hemisphere
  leverage for reduced cost and exposure and for focus elsewhere.
  Historical pattern: Procedural exit and retrenchment can preserve
  legitimacy (MEM–ANGLIA–WAR–AMERICAN–INDEPENDENCE–YORKTOWN, MEM–
  ANGLIA–CANADA; Anglian doctrine 03). Time and resource constraints
  favour prioritisation (doctrine 04 — time as weapon). Liability
  is reduced when the U.S. is less often the direct author of
  intervention outcomes.

  Key Assumptions:
  • Hemisphere security does not require current or higher levels
    of direct commitment — Linchpin: YES
  • Extra-hemispheric threats are sufficiently pressing to justify
    reallocation — Linchpin: YES
  • Lightening footprint does not trigger cascade defection or
    rival consolidation in the hemisphere — Linchpin: NO
  • Domestic politics accepts recalibration as strategic choice
    rather than retreat — Linchpin: NO

  Confidence: MODERATE
  Assessed against Anglian doctrines 03 (defeat/exit without
  collapse), 04 (time as weapon), and two precedents (British
  procedural exit at Yorktown; Canada’s autonomy without rupture).
  Binding constraint: whether domestic and partner audiences
  frame lightening as legitimate recalibration or as retreat —
  narrative control is partly endogenous to how the move is
  explained and sequenced.

  Risks: Rivals fill perceived vacuum; allies and partners lose
  confidence; later re-engagement (if needed) is costlier; domestic
  debate over "retreat" damages legitimacy.

  Conditions for success: Recalibration is framed as prioritisation
  and efficiency; key partners are reassured; rivals do not
  achieve decisive gains in the hemisphere during the transition.

  Conditions for failure: Cascade of defections or rival inroads;
  domestic narrative of failure; later crisis forces costly
  re-intervention.

  Discriminating evidence:
  • Watch for: Rhetoric from regional leaders on U.S. commitment;
    level of U.S. security and diplomatic presence; rival activity
    in hemisphere
  • Signal of failure: Major states publicly pivot toward rivals;
    new regional security arrangements excluding the U.S.;
    domestic political narrative of "lost" hemisphere

VI. STABILITY INDICATORS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Assessment of internal legitimacy stress signals relevant to
U.S. capacity and willingness to sustain hemisphere hegemony.

When internal stress is elevated, the legitimacy and institutional
continuity perspective carries elevated analytical weight.

| Indicator | Status | Assessment |
|-----------|--------|------------|
| Ideological coherence | STABLE | Constitutional and procedural narrative remains the default frame for legitimacy. Polarisation affects consensus on foreign policy but has not produced a durable alternative to the existing order. |
| Elite cohesion | STABLE | Foreign-policy elite and institutions (executive, Congress, agencies) continue to operate within shared procedural bounds despite partisan conflict. No systematic defection from institutional norms. |
| Popular legitimacy | STABLE | Public support for "leadership" and "engagement" varies with events and framing; no sustained majority for full withdrawal from hemisphere role. Cost sensitivity is a constraint, not a collapse signal. |
| Institutional function | STABLE | State institutions (diplomacy, defence, development) function; appropriations and authorities are contested but not suspended. Bureaucratic capacity to execute policy exists. |
| Narrative control | STABLE | Competing narratives (internationalist vs retrenchment) coexist; no single narrative has decisively displaced the other. "Order not empire" remains available as a legitimating frame. |

Current assessment: 0 of 5 indicators STRESSED; 0 CRITICAL.
Legitimacy perspective carries standard weight.
Threshold watch: If elite cohesion or popular legitimacy moves to
STRESSED (e.g. sustained majority for withdrawal from alliances,
or institutional breakdown over war powers), the liability
perspective and the cost of Option B and sustainability of Option A
would require re-assessment.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI-B. OPPONENT CONSTRAINT ASSESSMENT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Applicability: Material options depend on the behaviour of
extra-hemispheric rivals (e.g. China) and on the alignment choices
of Latin American states. This section tracks the principal
"opponent" or counterpart to hegemony: extra-hemispheric competition
and key regional states.

EXTRA-HEMISPHERIC RIVALS (e.g. China, Russia):

  Dimension: Political and economic inroads in the hemisphere;
  military presence remains limited.
  Binding constraint (rival side): Rivals cannot project conventional
  military force at scale in the Americas without triggering U.S.
  response; their leverage is primarily economic, diplomatic, and
  institutional. Their binding constraint is whether hemisphere
  states accept or resist their offers (investment, debt, political
  alignment). If acceptance passes a threshold, U.S. hegemony is
  contested; if resistance holds, rivals remain secondary.
  Discriminating signals: New base or basing agreements; major
  infrastructure or debt deals with strategic states; regional
  forum participation and voting patterns.

KEY LATIN AMERICAN STATES (variable by administration focus):

  Dimension: Alignment and defection. Success of Option A depends
  on a critical mass of states accepting U.S.-led order; Option B
  assumes some states are susceptible to deeper U.S. leverage;
  Option C assumes lightening does not trigger cascade defection.
  Binding constraint (entity side): Whether U.S. commitment and
  conduct sustain acceptance or trigger defection. Discriminating
  signals: Bilateral and multilateral voting; public rhetoric on
  U.S. role; signing of agreements with rivals; domestic political
  shifts toward or away from U.S. alignment.

Relative assessment: U.S. military dominance is not currently
contested in the hemisphere. The contest is over political and
economic alignment. The "degradation" curve that matters is not
military but political: does U.S. legitimacy and commitment
hold, or do defections and rival inroads accumulate? Monitoring
both curves (U.S. domestic willingness; regional acceptance vs
defection) is required for Options A, B, and C.

VII. DECISION-RELEVANT HISTORY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Historical patterns with current relevance, drawn from CIV–SCHOLAR–
ANGLIA, CIV–DOCTRINE–ANGLIA, and the ANGLIA MEM corpus (MEM–ANGLIA–*).
America has no separate MEM corpus; all citations are to Anglian
sources that cover U.S. or hemisphere experience.

PATTERN: Procedure as Order
  Activation: HIGH
  Source: CIV–DOCTRINE–ANGLIA 01 (Procedure as Civilizational Memory);
          MEM–ANGLIA–UNITED–STATES–AMERICA; MEM–ANGLIA–LAW–FEDERALIST–PAPERS
  Relevance: Hegemony sustained through institutional and procedural
  continuity rather than raw coercion. Authority in process and
  precedent; legitimacy survives retreat when exit is procedural.
  Direct relevance to Option A (maintain hegemony through procedural
  order) and Option C (lighten footprint as recalibration, not
  collapse).

PATTERN: Defeat and Exit Without Legitimacy Collapse
  Activation: HIGH
  Source: CIV–DOCTRINE–ANGLIA 03 (Defeat Without Legitimacy Collapse);
          MEM–ANGLIA–WAR–AMERICAN–INDEPENDENCE–YORKTOWN; MEM–ANGLIA–CANADA
  Relevance: British exit at Yorktown was procedurally encoded;
  Canada achieved autonomy without military rupture. Implication:
  the U.S. can recalibrate commitment (Option C) or accept local
  setbacks without framing them as systemic defeat, provided exit
  or adjustment is institutionally managed.

PATTERN: Declarative Perimeter Before Full Capacity
  Activation: MODERATE
  Source: MEM–AMERICA–MONROE
  Relevance: Monroe declared hemisphere perimeter when U.S. capacity
  was embryonic; Britain’s navy underwrote the order. Declaration
  and procedure can substitute for constant application of force.
  Supports Option A (order as narrative and institution).

PATTERN: Force and Territorial Reordering
  Activation: MODERATE
  Source: MEM–ANGLIA–WAR–SPANISH–AMERICAN; MEM–ANGLIA–WAR–MEXICAN–AMERICAN
  Relevance: U.S. has used force to expand territorial and political
  reach. Precedent for Option B (deepen footprint) but also for
  overreach risk: prolonged commitment without exit mechanism
  converts success into exhaustion (MEM–ANGLIA–WAR–HUNDRED–YEARS).

PATTERN: Time as Strategic Weapon and Coalition Primacy
  Activation: MODERATE
  Source: CIV–DOCTRINE–ANGLIA 04 (Time as Strategic Weapon), 05 (Coalition Primacy)
  Relevance: Delay and attrition favour the side with fiscal and
  coalition durability. Alliances absorb cost and share legitimacy.
  Supports Option A (institutional and coalition-based order) and
  Option C (prioritisation and efficiency).

PATTERN: Naval Denial as Existential Defence
  Activation: HIGH
  Source: CIV–DOCTRINE–ANGLIA 06; MEM–AMERICA–GEO–ATLANTIC;
          MEM–ANGLIA–WAR–NELSON–TRAFALGAR
  Relevance: Sea control and denial of hostile movement underwrite
  hemisphere security. As long as maritime supremacy holds, structural
  position is secure. No current threat to that supremacy; pattern
  is background condition for all options.

PATTERN: Mississippi Sequence (Chokepoint and Continental Union)
  Activation: HIGH
  Source: MEM–AMERICA–GEO–MISSISSIPPI–RIVER; SCHOLAR–AMERICA LEARN
          session (Mearsheimer audit, multi-mind, traversal 1763–1863)
  Relevance: Control of the mouth of the Mississippi guarantees
  control of the interior; the river system cannot be partially owned.
  Sequence: 1763 (Seven Years' War — mouth to Spain); Proclamation
  1763 and western frontier; Revolution; Pinckney Treaty 1795 (right
  of deposit); revocation 1802; Louisiana Purchase 1803 (U.S. secures
  chokepoint); Civil War 1862–63 (Vicksburg, Union holds mouth,
  Confederacy fractured). Legitimacy (union, expansion), structure
  (force ratio at chokepoint), and liability (who is on the hook when
  the mouth is lost) all rest on the same geographic fact. Relevant
  to Option A (order and legitimacy rest on control of key nodes) and
  to any scenario where hemisphere or continental integration depends
  on a single corridor or chokepoint.

PATTERN: Quarantine as Denial and Legitimacy of Coercion (1962)
  Activation: MODERATE
  Source: SCHOLAR–AMERICA LEARN session (Kennedy doctrine audit,
  Feb 2026); CIV–DOCTRINE–AMERICA 01, 05, 06; MEM–AMERICA–MONROE;
  MEM–ANGLIA–WAR–SPANISH–AMERICAN; MEM–RUSSIA–USSR–CUBAN–MISSILE–CRISIS
  Relevance: Cuban Missile Crisis quarantine (Oct 1962) illustrates
  naval denial (Doctrine 06) and coalition-backed procedure (OAS,
  Doctrine 05). Procedure was restored after Bay of Pigs (ExComm,
  Doctrine 01). Monroe and Spanish–American War set precedent for
  legitimising U.S. coercion in the hemisphere (perimeter declaration,
  liberation/procedural framing). Humanitarian and reputational cost
  of blockade remains a tension: legitimacy narrative and legal/soft-
  power cost vary by audience. Relevant to Option A (procedural order,
  coalition legitimacy) and Option B (footprint, legitimacy risk).

PATTERN: Exit Without Rupture (Yorktown, Canada, Option C)
  Activation: HIGH
  Source: MEM–ANGLIA–WAR–AMERICAN–INDEPENDENCE–YORKTOWN; MEM–ANGLIA–
  CANADA; SCHOLAR–AMERICA LEARN session (doctrine violations, Feb 2026)
  Relevance: Yorktown = defeat then procedural exit (Parliament,
  treaty); Canada = procedural autonomy without military defeat
  (evolution, gradual self-rule). Both illustrate Doctrine 03 (defeat
  or retreat without legitimacy collapse). For Option C (lighten
  footprint), Canada is the precedent that recalibration can be
  framed as evolution, not retreat—"order" sustained with reduced
  direct control. Narrative must present recalibration, not exit from
  order; liability falls on those who choose the move. Contrast:
  Vietnam = violation of 04 then procedurally managed exit (messier).

VIII. CROSS-ENTITY LINKS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

ANGLIA (United Kingdom):
  Dimension: Institutional and cultural inheritance; shared procedure;
  historical source of precedent.
  Key distinction: Anglia is the civilizational and institutional
  source for U.S. precedent. The U.S. is "Anglia unbound by island
  constraints" (MEM–ANGLIA–UNITED–STATES–AMERICA). No current
  operational dependency; relationship is historical and doctrinal
  for STATE purposes.

LATIN AMERICA (aggregate and key states):
  Dimension: Zone of varying political influence and control;
  alliance, neutrality, and defection.
  Key distinction: Subregional and national variation is the norm.
  Some states are close allies; others are neutral or aligned with
  rivals. Success of material options depends on whether a critical
  mass of states accept U.S.-led order (Option A), are susceptible
  to deeper leverage (Option B), or defect if footprint lightens
  (Option C). No single "opponent"; the variable is alignment.

CHINA:
  Dimension: Extra-hemispheric economic and diplomatic competitor
  in the Americas.
  Key distinction: China projects influence through trade, investment,
  and infrastructure, not military dominance. U.S. structural
  position is not militarily contested; political and economic
  competition is the dimension to monitor.

RUSSIA:
  Dimension: Extra-hemispheric diplomatic and limited military
  presence in the hemisphere.
  Key distinction: Russia’s footprint is smaller than China’s in
  economic terms; it retains diplomatic and symbolic ties with
  some states. Relevant to Option A (denial of rival inroads) and
  Option C (prioritisation of extra-hemispheric competition may
  include Russia in Europe/Ukraine context).
