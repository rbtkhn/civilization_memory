I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves **Chester W. Nimitz as war figure**: his command
as Commander in Chief, U.S. Pacific Fleet (CINCPAC) from December
1941 until the end of the Pacific War—the Central Pacific drive,
carrier warfare, submarine campaign, and the naval component of
victory over Japan. Nimitz shared the Pacific with MacArthur
(Southwest Pacific, land-centric); Nimitz's domain was the **Central
Pacific**—carrier task forces, amphibious assaults, and the
island chain (Gilberts, Marshalls, Marianas, Philippines, Iwo Jima,
Okinawa) that led to Japan. He was present at the Japanese surrender
(USS Missouri, 1945) alongside MacArthur.

It seems to me that the crucial point is that the Pacific war had
two American axes: MacArthur's advance through New Guinea and the
Philippines, and Nimitz's through the Central Pacific. The question,
really, is how naval power—carriers, submarines, amphibious
lift—enabled both. Nimitz built and directed the fleet that won
Midway (under his theatre command, though tactical execution by
Fletcher and Spruance), took Tarawa, Saipan, Guam, Leyte Gulf,
Iwo Jima, and Okinawa, and strangled Japan's sea lanes with
submarines. One has to understand that his legitimacy rested on
**theatre naval command**: coordination with MacArthur, subordination
to Washington (King, Marshall, president), and the operational
choices that preserved force while advancing. Institutional
continuity: the admiral who won the naval war accepted civilian
authority and shared the surrender ceremony with the army general.

The fact is that the structural picture was maritime: Japan could
not be defeated without control of the Pacific. Nimitz's incentive
structure was to use carrier superiority and amphibious capability
to seize bases, isolate Japanese strongholds, and bring B-29 range
within reach of the home islands. The name of the game was
**carrier-centric warfare** and **submarine attrition**; Nimitz
orchestrated both.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

II. CINCPAC: CENTRAL PACIFIC DRIVE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Nimitz took command of the Pacific Fleet in the wake of Pearl Harbor
(December 1941). He rebuilt morale and directed the war at sea.

Trajectory:
• **1942** — Coral Sea, Midway (theatre under Nimitz; Spruance and
  Fletcher in tactical command); Midway as turning point—carrier
  superiority established; Guadalcanal (joint with MacArthur's
  theatre; naval component under Nimitz's coordination)
• **1943–1944** — Central Pacific offensive: Gilberts (Tarawa),
  Marshalls (Kwajalein, Eniwetok), Marianas (Saipan, Guam, Tinian—
  June–August 1944); Battle of the Philippine Sea ("Great Marianas
  Turkey Shoot"); carrier dominance confirmed
• **1944–1945** — Leyte Gulf (October 1944)—Nimitz's and MacArthur's
  forces converge; Japanese fleet broken; Philippines liberated;
  Iwo Jima (February 1945); Okinawa (April–June 1945); kamikaze
  and attrition; fleet supports invasion
• **1945** — Surrender; Nimitz signs for the United States (naval
  component) on USS Missouri; MacArthur signs for Allied powers

Operational logic: **island-hopping** in the Central Pacific—seize
key atolls and islands for airfields and bases; bypass strongholds;
submarine campaign against Japanese merchant marine and warships.
Nimitz managed multiple task forces and amphibious operations;
coordination with MacArthur (e.g. Leyte) was sometimes tense but
produced combined results.

III. NAVAL THEATRE & CIVILIAN CONTROL
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Nimitz reported to Admiral King (Chief of Naval Operations) and
to the Joint Chiefs; he did not challenge civilian or strategic
policy. His role was **theatre naval execution**—win the Pacific
with the fleet. Contrast with MacArthur: Nimitz stayed within
the chain of command and did not publicly dispute Washington.
After the war he served as Chief of Naval Operations (1945–1947)
and helped transition the navy to peacetime. The institutional
memory is the **admiral who won without overreach**: naval victory,
shared surrender, subordination preserved.
