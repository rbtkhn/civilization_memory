I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves Appomattox as **America's procedural termination
of the Civil War**: the surrender at Appomattox Court House (April 9,
1865) of Lee's Army of Northern Virginia to Grant—terms that frame
victory as **restoration**, not annihilation—parole, no imprisonment,
officers retain sidearms; "The war is over; the rebels are our
countrymen again."

Appomattox is not a battlefield.
It is a **governance decision at the moment of victory**.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

II. STRATEGIC CONTEXT AT WAR'S END
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
By early 1865 Confederate defeat is structurally fixed. After
Gettysburg and Vicksburg, attrition, logistics, and manpower
exhaustion have eroded capacity. The challenge is **ending the war
without destroying the system the war was fought to preserve**.
The Union must win without becoming revolutionary.

Grant's terms—written in a few sentences (per Churchill's summary):
officers and men surrender arms and return on parole to their homes;
Grant adds that they may keep horses and mules for spring ploughing.
No tribunals, no mass punishment, no forced ideological confession.
Legitimacy through **reintegration**; procedure absorbs the defeated.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. APPOMATTOX AS PROCEDURAL CHOICE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The surrender represents a conscious choice to frame victory as
restoration.

Grant's terms:
• No imprisonment of Confederate soldiers
• Officers retain sidearms
• Soldiers paroled, not prosecuted
• Cessation without humiliation ritual

Primary source anchors:
• Grant (Memoirs): "The war is over; the rebels are our countrymen
  again."—encodes procedural instinct: authority restored through
  reintegration.
• Lee, Farewell to the Army of Northern Virginia (April 10, 1865):
  "After four years of arduous service… the Army of Northern Virginia
  has been compelled to yield to overwhelming numbers and resources."
  Lee accepts systemic defeat, not moral collapse; allows Confederate
  legitimacy to dissolve without revolutionary escalation.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Appomattox encodes **victory without delegitimisation**—the manner
of victory determines postwar stability. Force ends in procedure;
mercy is structural; legitimacy survives restraint.

Lessons:
• Ending a war can be harder than winning it; procedural termination
  preserves governability.
• Reintegration over eradication; "countrymen again" as precedent
  for post–civil war order.
• Limits: racial hierarchy and Reconstruction remain contested;
  procedure restores order, justice remains partial.

  termination; Appomattox as closing precedent.
• MEM–AMERICA–GRANT — Surrender architect; terms; civilian
  subordination; exhaustion logic completed.
• MEM–AMERICA–WAR–AMERICAN–CIVIL–LEE — Surrendering commander;
  acceptance of terms; Farewell Address; procedural choice.
• MEM–AMERICA–LINCOLN — Commander-in-chief; union preservation;
  assassination shortly after; procedure survives.
• MEM–AMERICA–WAR–AMERICAN–CIVIL–FORT–SUMTER — War begins at
  Sumter, ends at Appomattox; trigger and termination bookends.
• MEM–AMERICA–WAR–AMERICAN–CIVIL–GETTYSBURG — Gettysburg halts
  Confederate offensive; Appomattox executes termination.
• MEM–AMERICA–WAR–AMERICAN–CIVIL–VICKSBURG — Vicksburg makes
  defeat inevitable; Appomattox concludes it procedurally.

Cross-Civilizational:
• MEM–ANGLIA–WAR–AMERICAN–CIVIL–APPOMATTOX — Anglian encoding;
  procedural termination; same event, different frame.

Cross-references denote lineage, not equivalence.

VI. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Appomattox: Grant's terms; parole, no imprisonment; "countrymen
  again"; Lee's Farewell.
• Victory without regime reset; procedure absorbs the defeated.
• Bookend with Fort Sumter; procedural termination as American
  precedent.

Tension preserved without verdict.
