I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves Fort Sumter as **America's war trigger**: the
Confederate bombardment (April 12–14, 1861) of the federal garrison
in Charleston Harbor that made secession violent and gave the Union
a clear casus belli—**rebellion against federal authority on federal
property**—and allowed Lincoln to frame the war as restoration of
authority, not aggression.

Fort Sumter does not cause secession.
It **translates secession into open war and defines the Union's
legitimacy claim**.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. CONTEXT: SECESSION AND FEDERAL PROPERTY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
By April 1861 seven states have seceded; Confederacy claims
sovereignty. Fort Sumter remains in federal hands—symbol and fact
of continued federal presence in South Carolina. Confederate
authorities demand evacuation; Lincoln decides to resupply (not
reinforce provocatively). Confederacy chooses to reduce the fort
before supply arrives. Bombardment begins April 12, 1861; garrison
surrenders April 14 after heavy shelling; no Union combat deaths
during the engagement.

The **first shot** is fired by the secessionists against federal
property. Union frame: we are restoring authority over our own
fort; the rebellion has attacked the United States.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. SEQUENCE AND MEANING
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Elements:
• Federal fort in sovereign-claimed Confederate territory;
  resupply as assertion of federal right
• Confederate decision to fire first—operational and symbolic
• Surrender and evacuation; Union garrison leaves with honors
• Lincoln's response: call for volunteers; blockade; war framed as
  suppression of rebellion to preserve the Union

Lincoln, in his message to Congress (4 July 1861), framed the use of
war power as duty to preserve the government:

SOURCE — Lincoln, Message to Congress (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD):
> "It was with the deepest regret that the Executive found the duty of employing the war-power, in defence of the government, forced upon him. He could but perform this duty, or surrender the existence of the government."
> — Abraham Lincoln, Message to Congress in Special Session, 4 July 1861, in *Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln*, Vol. 4, ed. Roy P. Basler et al. (New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press, 1953) (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD) [ERC-PRIMARY].

Fort Sumter gives the Union **moral and legal clarity**: the other
side initiated violence against federal authority. Procedure
(congressional support, executive action) can be invoked without
ambiguity. Secession is not lawful withdrawal; it is rebellion
requiring force to restore the constitutional order.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Fort Sumter encodes **war as restoration of authority**—the moment
when contested sovereignty becomes armed conflict and the Union's
narrative (rebellion, restoration) is fixed.

Lessons:
• First shot matters for legitimacy; Confederate attack on federal
  property defines Union as defender of lawful authority.
• Federal presence on sovereign-claimed territory forces the
  secessionists to choose: tolerate or strike; they strike, and
  war follows.
• War trigger and procedural frame (preserve Union, restore
  authority) set the grammar for the next four years.

V. MEM CONNECTIONS (MANDATORY)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
AMERICA:
• MEM–AMERICA–WAR–AMERICAN–CIVIL — Parent war; secession vs union;
  Fort Sumter as trigger; war framed as restoration.
• MEM–AMERICA–LINCOLN — President at Sumter; decision to resupply;
  call for volunteers; union preservation as supreme objective.
• MEM–AMERICA–WAR–AMERICAN–CIVIL–APPOMATTOX — War begins at Sumter,
  ends at Appomattox; procedural bookends (trigger and termination).

Cross-Civilizational:
• MEM–ANGLIA–WAR–AMERICAN–CIVIL — Anglian encoding of same war;
  Fort Sumter as opening of internal stress test.

Cross-references denote lineage, not equivalence.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Fort Sumter: April 12–14, 1861; Confederate bombardment; federal
  garrison surrenders; first shot by secessionists.
• Union frame: rebellion against federal authority; war as restoration.
• Bookend with Appomattox: trigger and procedural termination.

Tension preserved without verdict.
