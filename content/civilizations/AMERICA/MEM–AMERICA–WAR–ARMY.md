I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves the **U.S. Army** as America's **land-force
institution**: the continuous (if renamed) military body raised by
Congress, subordinated to civilian authority, and deployed in every
major American war from independence onward.

The Army encodes **procedure over praetorianism**: legitimacy of
force derives from congressional raise and presidential command,
not from the institution's autonomous claim. It is the instrument
that Washington surrendered, that Lincoln and Grant used to preserve
the Union, and that Truman reasserted over MacArthur.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. ORIGIN — CONTINENTAL ARMY TO CONSTITUTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Continental Army was created by the Second Continental Congress
(1775); George Washington was appointed commander-in-chief. No
standing army existed under the Articles of Confederation. The
Constitution (1787) gave Congress the power to "raise and support
Armies" (Art. I, §8) and the President command as "Commander in
Chief" (Art. II, §2)—**dual key**: raise by legislature, employ by
executive.

Structural constraint: an army raised by law is legible to the
republic; one that raises itself is not. The design assumes that
neither branch alone can legitimate sustained land force.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. CIVILIAN CONTROL PRECEDENT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Washington's resignation of commission (1783) and refusal of
monarchy established **voluntary subordination** as founding
precedent. Lincoln's direction of Union strategy and appointment
of generals (McClellan, Grant) asserted civilian primacy during
civil war. Truman's relief of MacArthur (1951) reaffirmed that
theater commanders serve at the pleasure of the president;
disagreement on policy does not override the chain of command.

Russell Weigley, in *The American Way of War* (1973), frames the
Army's place in American strategic culture:

SOURCE — Weigley, *The American Way of War* (ARC-T-MODERN):
> "American military policy has been characterized by a strong tendency to see war as an alternative to diplomacy, and to see the object of war as the total overthrow of the enemy's government and the imposition of an unconditional surrender. … The American way of war has been the way of the big battalions and the direct, violent clash of massed forces."
> — Russell F. Weigley, *The American Way of War: A History of United States Military Strategy and Policy* (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1973) (ARC-T-MODERN) [ERC-SECONDARY].

The Army is the primary instrument of **mass and attrition** when
the republic commits to war; its legitimacy is conditional on
civilian authorization and recall.

IV. KEY WARS AND ROLES
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• **Independence:** Continental Army; endurance over decisive battle;
  Washington's restraint; Yorktown with French alliance.
• **1812:** Land invasions of Canada failed; defensive victories
  (New Orleans); small regular army plus militia.
• **Mexican–American War:** Expansion under Polk; regulars and
  volunteers; occupation and treaty.
• **Civil War:** Union Army mass mobilization; Grant's attrition;
  Sherman's campaigns; Appomattox.
• **Twentieth century:** Two world wars, Korea, Vietnam, Iraq,
  Afghanistan—always under civilian direction; MacArthur's
  relief the canonical assertion of that principle.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• The Army exists by legislative and executive grant, not by
  right of existence.
• Civilian control is tested in crisis (Lincoln, Truman);
  reassertion encodes procedure.
• Land force is the default instrument when the republic
  commits to sustained conflict; scale and duration are
  politically determined.

Tension preserved without verdict.

VI. MEM CONNECTIONS (TYPED)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
DEPENDS_ON:
• MEM–AMERICA–LAW–CONSTITUTION — Art. I (raise armies), Art. II
  (commander-in-chief); jurisdictional basis for Army existence
  and employment.

ENABLES:
• MEM–AMERICA–WAR–AMERICAN–INDEPENDENCE — Continental Army as
  instrument of the war; Washington's command.
• MEM–AMERICA–WAR–AMERICAN–CIVIL — Union Army as instrument;
  Grant, Sherman, Sheridan; attrition and surrender.

TEMPORAL_AFTER:
• MEM–AMERICA–PRESIDENT–WASHINGTON — Surrender of commission;
  precedent for civilian supremacy over the Army.
• MEM–AMERICA–PRESIDENT–TRUMAN — MacArthur relief (1951);
  civilian control reasserted over defiant general.

PARALLELS:
• MEM–AMERICA–WAR–NAVY — Sister service; same constitutional
  footing; different domain (sea); complementary force structure.

Cross-references denote lineage, not equivalence.
