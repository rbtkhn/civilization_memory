I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves the **U.S. Supreme Court** as America's **final
adjudicative jurisdiction** in cases arising under the Constitution
and federal law: the body that says what the law is when the other
branches or the states are accused of exceeding their authority.

From a liability perspective: the Court **assigns and reviews**
liability—it holds statutes or executive acts unconstitutional, or
it upholds them. It has **no army and no purse**; it depends on
political acceptance. **Who is on the hook** when the Court rules?
The losing party—but only if the executive enforces and the polity
acquiesces. Institutional survival of the Court's authority is
**conditional on compliance** by others.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

II. ARTICLE III — JURISDICTION GRANT AND LIMITS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
"The judicial Power of the United States, shall be vested in one
supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may
from time to time ordain and establish."

Jurisdiction extends to cases and controversies arising under the
Constitution, federal law, treaties; to ambassadors; to admiralty;
to disputes between states or between a state and citizens of
another state. **No advisory opinions**; the Court may act only
when a concrete case is before it. **Exposure** is thus bounded—
the Court cannot reach out to decide abstract questions; it must
wait for a party to bring a justiciable dispute.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. JUDICIAL REVIEW — MARBURY AND THE MECHANISM
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
*Marbury v. Madison* (1803): the Court claimed authority to declare
federal statutes unconstitutional. Marshall's logic: the Constitution
is supreme law; the Court expounds the law in cases before it;
therefore when a statute conflicts with the Constitution, the Court
must prefer the Constitution.

**Liability mechanism**: a law that exceeds Congress's delegated
power is void—not because the Court has a veto, but because the
Court's **duty** in deciding the case is to apply the supreme law.
**Who bears the cost?** The litigant whose statutory claim is
struck; the Congress whose act is nullified. **Defection incentive**:
presidents and states have sometimes ignored or resisted Court
rulings (e.g. Jackson and the Cherokee cases; Southern resistance
to *Brown*). The Court's authority is not self-executing.

SOURCE — Marshall, *Marbury v. Madison*, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137 (1803) (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD):
> "It is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is. Those who apply the rule to particular cases, must of necessity expound and interpret that rule. If two laws conflict with each other, the courts must decide on the operation of each. So if a law be in opposition to the constitution; if both the law and the constitution apply to a particular case, so that the court must either decide that case conformably to the law, disregarding the constitution; or conformably to the constitution, disregarding the law; the court must determine which of these conflicting rules governs the case. This is of the very essence of judicial duty."
> — *Marbury v. Madison*, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 177–178 (1803) (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD) [ERC-PRIMARY].

IV. ENFORCEMENT DEPENDENCE — INSTITUTIONAL SURVIVAL
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Court does not execute its own orders. It depends on the
executive to enforce and on the political culture to accept. **When
compliance fails**, the Court's ruling is a piece of paper—as in
the Cherokee removal (Jackson), or in delayed implementation of
*Brown v. Board of Education*. Institutional survival of judicial
supremacy is therefore **fragile**: it holds only so long as the
other branches and the states have an incentive to comply. That
incentive is a mix of legitimacy belief and fear of backlash.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. APPOINTMENT AND TENURE — PERSONAL EXPOSURE OF JUSTICES
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Justices are nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate.
They hold office during good behaviour (life tenure). **Liability**:
justices are not elected; they are insulated from immediate
political retaliation. But they are **exposed to history and
legitimacy**—a Court that repeatedly defies sustained political
majorities may face court-packing, jurisdiction-stripping, or
erosion of compliance. The design trades short-term independence
for long-term dependence on perceived legitimacy.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Supreme Court encodes **law as the limit on power**: the
Constitution and Bill of Rights are not self-enforcing; the Court
claims the role of saying what they mean in concrete cases. That
claim is **conditional**—it survives only while the polity accepts
it. Anglian common-law tradition (courts expounding law) is
Americanized into constitutional review. Restraint is procedural;
the Court is the **mechanism** that applies the written frame to
disputes, but the mechanism has no sword.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Court has jurisdiction over cases and controversies; no advisory power.
• Judicial review: Court may hold laws unconstitutional; authority claimed in Marbury.
• Court depends on executive and political compliance; no self-enforcement.
• Justices enjoy life tenure; exposure is to legitimacy and long-term backlash.
• Defection (president, states) when Court is ignored; institutional survival is conditional.

Tension preserved without verdict.

VIII. MEM CONNECTIONS (MANDATORY)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

DEPENDS_ON:
• MEM–AMERICA–LAW–CONSTITUTION — Art. III creates the judiciary; Court expounds Constitution.
• MEM–AMERICA–LAW–BILL–RIGHTS — Court enforces Bill of Rights against federal and (via incorporation) state action.
• MEM–AMERICA–MADISON — Structural design; judiciary as one of three branches.

ENABLES:
• (Downstream) — Doctrine on federalism, rights, war powers; Court as expositor of constitutional meaning.

CONTRADICTS:
• (Tension) — Political branches may resist or evade Court; tension between judicial supremacy and popular sovereignty.

PARALLELS:
• MEM–ANGLIA–LAW–PARLIAMENT — Courts as expounders of law; Anglian precedent for judicial role (distinct from Parliament's supremacy).
