I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves Douglas MacArthur as **America's theatre
commander who tested civilian supremacy**: the general who led
Pacific victory (WWII), oversaw Japan's occupation and
constitutional refoundation, then in Korea advanced to the Yalu,
challenged presidential policy (limited war vs. expansion), and
was relieved by Truman (April 1951)—encoding the limit of
theatre command and the reaffirmation of procedure over the
hero-general.

MacArthur does not break the republic.
He **tests** it: his removal confirms that the president sets
strategy and the general obeys; procedure over personality.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. ORIGIN & STYLE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
MacArthur rises through institutional military and Pacific command.

Context:
• World War I; Superintendent West Point (1919–1922); Philippines
  (1930s); Chief of Staff (1930–1935)
• Pacific command from 1941; Supreme Commander Southwest Pacific;
  Philippines return (1944–1945); acceptance of Japanese surrender
  (1945); Supreme Commander Allied Powers (SCAP)—occupation and
  constitutional reform in Japan
• Legitimacy from **execution and theatre dominance**—victory,
  ceremony, and personal authority; less from coalition subordination
  (contrast Eisenhower's alliance management)

Authority is framed as **theatre sovereign**: the general who
delivers victory and then governs the defeated (Japan); when
policy (Korea) constrains theatre ambition, he challenges it
publicly.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. PACIFIC VICTORY & JAPAN OCCUPATION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
MacArthur presides over Pacific war termination and occupation.

Elements:
• Island-hopping; Philippines return ("I shall return"); Japan
  surrender (USS Missouri, 1945); MacArthur as accepting authority
• SCAP (1945–1951)—occupation administration; constitutional
  reform; demilitarisation; procedural refoundation of Japan under
  American direction
• Legitimacy of **victor as governor**—theatre commander extends
  into political reconstruction; success encodes both military
  and institutional role

The general who wins **administers** the peace in theatre;
civilian authority (Truman, Washington) sets the frame, but
MacArthur exercises broad discretion until Korea forces a clash.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. KOREA: ADVANCE, CLASH, RELIEF
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
MacArthur commands in Korea until policy conflict triggers removal.

Sequence:
• UN Command (1950); Inchon landing; breakout; advance toward
  Yalu River (China border)
• Chinese intervention (late 1950); reversal; MacArthur advocates
  expansion—bombing China, blockade, possible nuclear use—to win
  the war rather than hold the line
• Truman policy: **limited war**—contain aggression, avoid general
  war with China; no expansion of conflict
• MacArthur publicly disagrees; letters, statements; challenges
  civilian policy from theatre
• Truman relieves MacArthur (April 1951)—"I could not allow
  a subordinate to defy the policy of the United States."
• Stalemate and armistice follow under Eisenhower; MacArthur's
  removal encodes **civilian supremacy**—president over general

The theatre commander who seeks to expand the war is **removed**;
procedure (commander-in-chief, chain of command) prevails over
popularity and military prestige.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. CIVILIZATIONAL MEMORY FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
MacArthur encodes **the limit of theatre command and the
reaffirmation of civilian supremacy**.

Lessons:
• Theatre command has a ceiling: strategy and escalation (limited
  vs. general war) are set by civilian authority; the general
  executes or is relieved.
• Public challenge to presidential policy by a general triggers
  removal; procedure over personality; Washington's precedent
  (civilian control) applied.
• The hero-general (Pacific victory, Japan, Inchon) can be fired
  when he defies policy; legitimacy of office (president) over
  legitimacy of fame (general).
• Limited war can be maintained only if the theatre commander
  accepts limits; MacArthur's relief preserves the option of
  limited war as policy choice.
• "Old soldiers never die"—MacArthur's exit line encodes the
  general's submission to procedure even in departure; the
  republic survives the removal.

MacArthur is America's **removed theatre commander**: victory
in Pacific and Japan, then Korea clash and relief; procedure
reaffirmed by his firing.

VI. MEM CONNECTIONS (MANDATORY)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
AMERICA:
• MEM–AMERICA–PRESIDENT–TRUMAN — President who relieved MacArthur (April 1951);
  limited war policy; civilian control enforced by removal;
  "buck stops here."
• MEM–AMERICA–PRESIDENT–WASHINGTON — Civilian control and restraint;
  Washington's deference to civilian authority; MacArthur as
  inverse—general who did not defer and was removed; procedure
  over person.
• MEM–AMERICA–PRESIDENT–JACKSON — Executive removal of defiant authority;
  Jackson's confrontations and removals; Truman's firing of
  MacArthur—office over popular figure.
• MEM–AMERICA–PRESIDENT–EISENHOWER — Fellow general; Supreme Commander
  Europe under civilian authority; Korea armistice under
  Eisenhower presidency after MacArthur's relief; contrast:
  Ike accepted limits, MacArthur did not.
• MEM–AMERICA–PRESIDENT–GRANT — General who accepted civilian control;
  Grant as executor under Lincoln and Johnson; MacArthur as
  general who challenged and was relieved; precedent for
  subordination.
• MEM–AMERICA–PRESIDENT–ROOSEVELT–FRANKLIN — MacArthur under FDR (Pacific);
  Truman succeeds FDR; MacArthur's relief under Truman, not FDR.
• MEM–AMERICA–PRESIDENT–LINCOLN — Crisis presidency; civilian control of
  military; Lincoln's management of generals; Truman's removal
  of MacArthur as parallel.

Cross-references denote lineage, not equivalence.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Theatre command is bounded; strategy and escalation belong to
  civilian authority; general obeys or is relieved.
• Public defiance of policy triggers removal; procedure over
  popularity.
• Hero-general can be fired; office (president) over fame (general).
• Limited war requires theatre commander's acceptance of limits;
  MacArthur's relief preserves limited war as option.
• MacArthur is Washington's inverse: the general who did not
  defer; his removal reaffirms the norm.

Tension preserved without verdict.
