MEM–RELEVANCE–AMERICA — v1.0
Civilizational Memory Codex · MEM Relevance Index

Status: ACTIVE
Version: 1.0
Entity: United States / America (Western Hemisphere hegemon)
Purpose: Maps STATE-relevant analytical dimensions to MEM files (ANGLIA corpus)
Last Updated: February 2026

This index enables the Decision Points activity and other STATE
analyses to quickly identify which MEM files contain relevant historical
parallels, patterns, and precedents for the current decision space.

American-primary MEMs (including GEO) live in content/civilizations/AMERICA/
(MEM–AMERICA–*). Remaining historical grounding is drawn from the ANGLIA
MEM set (MEM–ANGLIA–*) in content/civilizations/ANGLIA/.

Organised by the analytical dimensions that recur in CIV–STATE–AMERICA.
Each dimension lists MEMs ranked by relevance (primary = central to the
dimension; secondary = relevant context).

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
HOW TO USE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. Identify the analytical dimension of the current Decision Point
   (e.g. "hegemony maintenance" or "Latin America influence")
2. Consult the relevant section below
3. Load primary MEMs first; secondary MEMs for depth
4. Cross-reference: a Decision Point may span multiple dimensions
5. Read MEM file contents; do not cite by name only (grounded parallels)
