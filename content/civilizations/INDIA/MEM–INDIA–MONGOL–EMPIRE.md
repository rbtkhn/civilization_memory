I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves India’s encounter with the Mongol empire as
**deflection followed by absorption**: Delhi Sultanate resisted
Mongol pressure and was never ruled by a Mongol khanate; Timur’s
sack of Delhi (1398) delivered shock without conquest; the Mughal
founding (1526) brought Mongol–Timurid lineage into India as a
dynasty that was then absorbed into the Indian civilizational
substrate.

India was **raided and sacked** by Mongol and Timurid forces; it
was **never** ruled by a Mongol khanate. It was later **ruled** by
a dynasty claiming Mongol and Timurid descent—and that dynasty
is remembered as Indian.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. MONGOL PRESSURE & DELHI SULTANATE — DEFLECTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
From the early thirteenth century, Mongol (Chagatai) raids targeted
the northwest and the Indus corridor—the same entry axis used by
Alexander and later by the Company.

The Delhi Sultanate:
• Repelled, bought off, or contained repeated incursions
• Fortified the northwest; paid tribute when expedient
• Never submitted to a Mongol khanate; no Ilkhanate or Chagatai
  administration in India

Structural outcome: India **deflected** Mongol conquest. Steppe
pressure was real; conquest was not achieved. The Sultanate’s
survival preserved a distinct political center on the Ganges—
one of the empires that reconstitute along the basin (MEM–INDIA–
GEO–GANGES).

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. TIMUR’S SACK OF DELHI (1398) — SHOCK WITHOUT CONQUEST
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Timur’s invasion and sack of Delhi in 1398 delivered a major
civilizational shock: mass violence, pillage, and the symbolic
shattering of Sultanate authority.

Key features:
• Timurid army penetrates to Delhi; city sacked
• Sultanate survives but is weakened; legitimacy and capacity
  damaged
• No lasting Timurid occupation; Timur withdraws

India experiences **raiding and decapitation**—analogous in scale
of violence to what Persia experienced from the Mongols (MEM–
PERSIA–MONGOL–EMPIRE)—but not **occupation**. The Sultanate
reconstitutes; the Ganges core holds. Tension: shock without
conquest; trauma without political replacement.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. MUGHAL ENTRY — TIMURID–MONGOL LINEAGE AS INDIAN DYNASTY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Babur (1483–1530), Timurid and Genghisid by lineage, enters India
in 1526 at First Battle of Panipat. The Mughal founding is the
**absorption** phase: Mongol–Timurid descent enters not as khanate
but as dynasty—and that dynasty is encoded in Indian memory as
**Mughal**, i.e. absorbed (MEM–INDIA–DYNASTY–MUGHAL).

Structural continuity with defection theory (CIV–SCHOLAR–INDIA
SYNTHESIS 0003): at Panipat, defender’s cohesion failed—Lodi
nobility had invited or accommodated Babur; elite defection and
political fragmentation enabled entry. Same pattern as Plassey
(defender elites); opposite to Hyphasis (invader’s army stops).
Mughal entry is **conquest via fragmentation**, then **rule via
absorption**.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. CIVILIZATIONAL CONSEQUENCE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Outcomes:
• India deflected Mongol khanate rule (13th–14th c.).
• India endured Timur’s sack (1398) without losing the Ganges
  core or civilizational continuity.
• India absorbed the Mughals—a dynasty of Mongol–Timurid
  lineage—as legitimate Indian rulers.
• No MEM encodes “Mongol India”; the Mughals are encoded as
  **India’s** absorption test case, not as “Mongol occupation.”

Rule learned:
Steppe pressure can be deflected; sack can be survived; lineage
can be absorbed. India’s civilizational continuity is asserted
by deflection, survival, and absorption—not by erasure of the
Mongol–Timurid thread but by its integration into Indian
political and cultural memory.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• India was raided by Mongols; India was never ruled by a Mongol
  khanate.
• Delhi Sultanate deflected conquest; Timur’s sack was shock
  without political replacement.
• Mughal = Mongol–Timurid lineage absorbed as Indian.
• Northwest corridor (Indus, Punjab) is the recurring axis of
  steppe and external pressure—Alexander, Mongols, Timur, Company.
• Deflection (Sultanate) and absorption (Mughal) are two modes of
  India’s encounter with Mongol-world power.

Tension preserved without verdict.

VII. EVIDENCE — ARC-T-MODERN (ATTRIBUTION)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Mongol empire, Silk Road, and Timurid–Mughal lineage in relation to
India’s medieval/early-modern interface are attested in modern
synthesis as follows [ERC-SECONDARY].

Weatherford frames the Mongol empire as catalyst for trade,
transmission, and political formation across Eurasia; the Mughal
Empire of India appears in the genealogical and transmission
narrative linking Mongol conquests to later sedentary empires.
Babur is Timurid (Timur) with Genghisid ancestry; Mughal founding
is thus the channel through which Mongol–Timurid lineage enters
India as ruling dynasty.

(2004) [ARC–INDIA-T-MODERN]. Summary/attribution; verify for verbatim.

Babur’s own account (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD): CIV–ARC–INDIA lists Babur,
*Baburnama* (Memoirs; Mughal founding). Primary witness for
Mughal entry; defection/fragmentation context at Panipat per
MEM–INDIA–DYNASTY–MUGHAL, defection theory.

VIII. MEM CONNECTIONS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• MEM–INDIA–DYNASTY–MUGHAL — Mughal = absorption of Mongol–Timurid
  lineage; First Panipat (1526); defection theory (defender elites).
• MEM–INDIA–DELHI–SULTANATE — Sultanate deflected Mongol pressure;
  endured Timur 1398; fell to Mughals at Panipat (defender elites).
• MEM–INDIA–GEO–GANGES — Delhi Sultanate, Mughal among empires
  reconstituting along the Ganges; core holds.
• MEM–INDIA–GEO–INDUS — Northwest corridor; same axis as Mongol
  raids, Timur, Company.
• MEM–INDIA–WAR–CLIVE — Same defection type (defender elites,
  fragmentation) at opposite epoch; Mughal entry at Panipat,
  Company entry at Plassey.
• MEM–INDIA–WAR–ALEXANDER — Invader at edge (Hyphasis); contrast
  with Mongol deflection (no invader victory) and Mughal absorption.
• MEM–PERSIA–MONGOL–EMPIRE — Persia: Ilkhanate, conquest and
  conversion; India: deflection then absorption via Mughal. Cross-
  civilization contrast.
• MEM–PERSIA–SILK–ROAD — Pax Mongolica; trade and transmission;
  maritime displacement. India at Silk Road’s eastern reach.
• MEM–INDIA–MONGOL–CHAGATAI — Chagatai Khanate raids and Delhi
  Sultanate deflection; granular sibling to this file’s § II.
• MEM–INDIA–WAR–TIMUR — 1398 shock without conquest; granular
  sibling to this file’s § III.
• MEM–INDIA–WAR–GHAZNAVID — Force at distance / invader limit;
  pre-Mongol instance of Hyphasis-type.
• MEM–INDIA–ISLAM — India–Islam interface; Sultanate, Mughal,
  Partition; absorption and rupture.
• Defection theory — See CIV–SCHOLAR–INDIA SYNTHESIS 0003,
  RLL–INDIA–0002.
