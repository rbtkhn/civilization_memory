I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves the **Indus Valley Civilization (IVC)** as India’s earliest urban civilizational layer in the Indus basin: the first large-scale urban order, trade-based and non-militarized, whose decline and eastward migration prefigure the origin-versus-permanence pattern encoded in MEM–INDIA–GEO–INDUS–RIVER and MEM–INDIA–GEO–GANGES–RIVER.

The IVC encodes **origin-basin urban grammar**, not enduring heartland. Its loss of centrality and the relocation of population and legacy to the Ganges basin are consistent with the rule that India adapts by **relocation, not collapse**, and that **memory outlasts territory**.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. URBAN ORDER AND TRADE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The IVC (Harappan) is the first mature urban civilization in the Indus system and one of the Bronze Age’s largest. At its peak it covered an area larger than Egypt and Mesopotamia combined, with an estimated population of roughly five million and major nodes from the Indus to Gujarat and into the Oxus/BMAC trade corridor.

Archaeology points to **planned cities** (e.g. Harappa, Mohenjo-daro) with hydraulic management, standardized weights and measures, and value-adding processing: raw materials and agricultural goods turned into finished products (e.g. indigo, handicrafts, jewelry) for exchange with Sumer, the Gulf (Dilmun, Oman), and possibly Egypt and China. Urban centres function as **nodes in a trade network** rather than as seats of dynastic or priestly monopoly. No palaces or monumental temples have been identified; access within the cities appears open rather than restricted to elite precincts. Walls are interpreted as supporting **customs and tolls** rather than defence. There is **no secure evidence of organized warfare**: no weapon burials, no warrior caste, no clear destruction layers in the major centres. Statehood in this layer appears **administrative before coercive**—aligned with the encoding in MEM–INDIA–GEO–INDUS–RIVER.

Material welfare was high by contemporary standards: private sanitation (drainage, flush systems), public baths, reservoirs, and wind-tower cooling. Skeletal and dietary evidence suggests relatively **egalitarian** conditions compared with contemporary Egypt and Mesopotamia. Standardization of brick and weights supported durable construction and long-distance exchange. Script on seals remains undeciphered; if a fuller writing system existed on perishable media (e.g. palm), it is lost, so the **operating system of the culture**—mythology, religion, legitimacy—is not directly recoverable. Speculative reconstructions (e.g. a “proto-Buddhist” or continuity with later Indian notions of karma, dharma, and release) are not binding on this MEM; they are noted only as hypotheses that would, if validated, align IVC with later Ganges-centred religious and legitimacy grammar.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. DECLINE AND EASTWARD MIGRATION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The IVC lost centrality over roughly the 19th–17th centuries BCE. The **4.2 ka event** (widespread aridification) is a major correlate: it coincides with the end of the Egyptian Old Kingdom and the collapse of the Akkadian empire and would have disrupted the long-distance demand (Egyptian burial demand, Mesopotamian bronze demand) on which IVC prosperity depended. Structurally, a **trade-dependent polity with no coercive capacity** is vulnerable to (1) demand collapse and (2) the movement of neighbouring populations under stress. When Mesopotamian and Egyptian demand shrank, IVC cities lost economic reason to sustain density; depopulation and **eastward migration** into the Ganges basin and elsewhere followed. Steppe and BMAC-related movements into the region are described in current scholarship as gradual assimilation and cultural merger rather than a single military conquest; the outcome is consistent with **relocation, not collapse**—civilizational content and population move rather than disappear.

MEM–INDIA–GEO–INDUS–RIVER encodes the same pattern: “Climatic and tectonic shifts reduce Indus centrality”; “Population movement eastward”; “Vedic integration with Gangetic plains”; “Indus retained as memory, not core”; “India adapts by relocation, not collapse.” The IVC is the **antiquity instantiation** of that pattern: the origin basin loses urban centrality; the Ganges becomes the zone of reconstitution.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. LEGACY AND RECONSTITUTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The legacy of the IVC is debated. What is not in doubt is that **later Indian civilization**—Vedic, Mauryan, Gupta, and the religious and political orders centred on the Ganges—does not present itself as a direct political successor to the IVC. The **name and archaeology** of the IVC were unknown to Indian tradition until British-era excavation; in that sense “memory” of the IVC as a named polity did not outlast territory. What can be said is that **civilizational content**—administrative habits, possibly elements of worldview—may have been re-embedded in Ganges- and subcontinent-centred traditions without explicit attribution. The “synchronization” of Indo-European and indigenous elements into Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism, and the later institutionalization of those traditions along the Ganges (e.g. Maurya/Ashoka, Gupta), fits the encoding of MEM–INDIA–GEO–GANGES–RIVER: “Where the Indus is origin, the Ganges is permanence”; “Empires repeatedly reconstitute along the Ganges”; “Sacred geography stabilizes legitimacy.” The IVC thus supports the doctrine that **origin can be lost** and **permanence reconstitutes** in the heartland basin; the IVC is the deep-time positive case alongside Partition (1947) as the modern severance case.

V. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Origin-basin urban order can be lost without civilizational erasure.
• Administrative and trade-based order can precede coercive statehood.
• Demand collapse and climate shock expose trade-dependent, non-militarized polities.
• Eastward migration and Ganges reconstitution are the recurring response to Indus-basin loss of centrality.
• Legacy can persist as re-embedded content without explicit memory of the origin polity.
• IVC is the antiquity positive instance for the origin-versus-permanence pattern (RLL–INDIA–0001).

Tension preserved without verdict.

VI. SOURCE EVIDENCE

**ARC–INDIA-T-MODERN (verbatim) [ERC-SECONDARY]**

Civilizational continuity from the Indus urban layer to later India is attested in modern synthesis:

> Nothing should more deeply shame the modern student than the recency and inadequacy of his acquaintance with India. Here is a vast peninsula of nearly two million square miles; two-thirds as large as the United States, and twenty times the size of its master, Great Britain; 320,000,000 souls, more than in all North and South America combined, or one-fifth of the population of the earth; **an impressive continuity of development and civilization from Mohenjo-daro, 2900 B.C. or earlier, to Gandhi, Raman and Tagore**; faiths compassing every stage from barbarous idolatry to the most subtle and spiritual pantheism; philosophers playing a thousand variations on one monistic theme from the Upanishads eight centuries before Christ to Shankara eight centuries after him; scientists developing astronomy three thousand years ago, and winning Nobel prizes in our own time; a democratic constitution of untraceable antiquity in the villages, and wise and beneficent rulers like Ashoka and Akbar in the capitals; minstrels singing great epics almost as old as Homer, and poets holding world audiences today; artists raising gigantic temples for Hindu gods from Tibet to Ceylon and from Cambodia to Java, or carving perfect palaces by the score for Mogul kings and queens — this is the India that patient scholarship is now opening up, like a new intellectual continent, to that Western mind which only yesterday thought civilization an exclusively European thing.

**External reference (illustrative, non-ARC)**  
Narrative detail on IVC urban form, trade, 4.2 ka collapse, eastward migration, and legacy (including speculative “proto-Buddhism”) is consistent with synthesis lectures such as Predictive History (Jiang Xueqin), “Civilization #20: The Proto-Buddhists of the Indus Valley Civilization.” That source is external to ARC; its structural claims (trade dependence, no warfare, migration to Ganges, synchronization) are used only for consistency with this MEM and with TEST–RLL–INDIA–0001–IVC–LECTURE–POSITIVE. Speculative elements are not binding.

VII. MEM CONNECTIONS (TYPED)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

GEOGRAPHIC:
• MEM–INDIA–GEO–INDUS–RIVER — IVC is the ancient urban civilization of the Indus basin; GEO–INDUS–RIVER encodes the basin as origin spine and “relocation, not collapse”; this MEM instantiates that pattern in antiquity.
• MEM–INDIA–GEO–GANGES–RIVER — Reconstitution zone after IVC decline; “where the Indus is origin, the Ganges is permanence”; later empires and religions institutionalize along the Ganges.

DEPENDS_ON:
• MEM–INDIA–GEO–INDUS–RIVER — Prerequisite: the Indus as origin spine and the rule that loss of origin is survivable.

ENABLES:
• MEM–INDIA–BRONZE–AGE — Period context for IVC: interconnected world, demand drivers, 4.2 ka collapse; comparative distinctiveness.
• MEM–INDIA–GEO–GANGES–RIVER — IVC decline and eastward migration establish the Ganges as the zone where continuity reconstitutes; supports the dual-basin grammar.
• MEM–INDIA–DYNASTY–MAURYA — Ganges-centred state formation (Maurya, Ashoka) is the later institutionalization of the reconstituted heartland; no direct political continuity with IVC, but same geographic logic.

TEMPORAL_BEFORE:
• MEM–INDIA–DYNASTY–MAURYA — IVC precedes Mauryan consolidation by over a millennium; Maurya is Ganges-centred reconstitution.
• MEM–INDIA–PARTITION — IVC is the antiquity case of origin-basin loss; Partition is the modern severance case; same RLL (RLL–INDIA–0001).
