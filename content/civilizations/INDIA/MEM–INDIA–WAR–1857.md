I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves the Rebellion of 1857 as **India’s decisive
exposure of imperial structural dependence**: the moment when the
invader’s local proxy force (sepoy army) defected against the
invader—the third defection type in the India WAR pattern.

1857 is not primarily a military defeat of the British.
It is **mechanism failure**: who was on the hook when the proxy turned.

II. MECHANISM FAILURE — INVADER'S PROXY DEFECTS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Imperial rule in India depended structurally on Indian troops.

Conditions:
• Bengal Army ~159,000 (c. 1857): ~135,000 Indian (sepoys/sowars), ~24,000 European
• Company had reduced British regiments (economy, Crimean War)
• Discipline and grievance (annexations, cartridges, pay) strain loyalty

When sepoys mutinied (Meerut, May 1857), the **invader’s mechanism**
failed: the force that had enforced imperial order defected against it.

Exposure fell on the Company—and then the Crown.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. JURISDICTION SHIFT & REORGANIZATION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Who had compulsory authority over the sepoy force? The Company had
raised and deployed it; when that proxy force turned, the Company
was on the hook.

After 1857 jurisdiction shifted: Crown took over from Company.
Formal governance replaced commercial extraction as the nominal
frame—though extraction persisted.

Post-1857 reorganization:
• Reduced dependence on a single mass sepoy force
• Greater reliance on “loyal” units (e.g. Sikh, Gurkha); ratio shift
• Military structure redefined to avoid repeat exposure

The rebellion is suppressed; the structural lesson is encoded in
imperial policy.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. CIVILIZATIONAL CONSEQUENCE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Outcomes:
• Company rule ends; Crown rule begins
• Imperial legitimacy reframed (governance rhetoric, not only trade)
• Indian resistance encoded as mutiny (imperial narrative) or as
  first war of independence (nationalist narrative)—same event,
  opposite legitimacy claims
• Civilizational endurance: empire continues; mechanism is repaired,
  not abandoned

Rule learned (structural):
Dependence on a local proxy force is a defection risk; when the
proxy defects, exposure falls on the principal. Jurisdiction follows
liability.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Invader’s-proxy defection: third type in India WAR pattern (with
  invader at edge—Hyphasis—and defender elites—Plassey).
• Who was exposed when the mechanism failed: Company, then Crown.
• Jurisdiction shift encodes who was on the hook.
• 1857 does not end empire; it forces mechanism repair and
  legitimacy reframe.
• India’s civilizational continuity is asserted by resistance as
  much as by absorption.

Tension preserved without verdict.

VI. MEM CONNECTIONS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• MEM–INDIA–BRITISH–EMPIRE — Company-to-Crown; 1857 as structural
  rupture; jurisdiction shift; procedural–extractive overlay.
• MEM–INDIA–WAR–CLIVE — Defender-elite defection (Plassey) vs.
  invader’s-proxy defection (1857); same defection theory, opposite
  locus.
• MEM–INDIA–WAR–ALEXANDER — Invader at edge (Hyphasis); three
  defection types complete the pattern.
• Defection theory — See CIV–SCHOLAR–INDIA SYNTHESIS 0003,
  RLL–INDIA–0002.
• MEM–INDIA–PARTITION — Exit dynamics; colonial legacy.
• MEM–INDIA–GANDHI — Legitimacy attack on imperial rule; resistance
  continuity.
