This file learns from the present — analysing current events through
historically-grounded patterns to provide structured decision-relevant
options. It is informed by, but does not feed back into, CIV–SCHOLAR–INDIA,
which learns from the past. Information flows from STATE into Scholar
only via explicit "relay to scholar" (CIV–STATE–TEMPLATE §XIV-B).

Duty of Competence: This file is subject to a completeness standard.
The system's obligation is to surface all material options identifiable
through the application of three analytical perspectives: legitimacy
and institutional continuity; power distribution and structural
constraint; and leadership liability and mechanism. Failure to apply
any perspective constitutes a completeness violation.

I. ENTITY IDENTIFICATION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Name: India / Republic of India (Bhārat)
Classification: CIVILIZATION-STATE
Active: YES
Capital: New Delhi
Current State Form: Federal republic (1950–present)

India is a civilization-state: a modern state that claims continuous
civilizational identity across multiple state forms. Accretive continuity
(Indus → Vedic → Mauryan → Gupta → Indo-Persian → Mughal → British →
Republic) shapes both domestic legitimacy and foreign policy. Strategic
patience, plural cohesion, civilizational non-alignment, and exit-building
are structural constraints, not preferences.

Phase History (simplified):
1. Ancient (Mauryan, Gupta)
2. Medieval (Delhi Sultanate, Mughal)
3. Colonial (Company, Crown)
4. Republic (1950–present)

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. SUCCESSION AND INHERITANCE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

INTERNAL SUCCESSION:
British India (Crown) → Dominion of India (1947) → Republic of India (1950)
Type: DIRECT_CONTINUATION across state-form changes.
Partition (1947) severs Indus basin from Indian sovereignty; Ganges
basin remains. Administrative spine (IAS, federal structure, procedure)
retained. (Source: CIV–DOCTRINE–INDIA 01; MEM–INDIA–PARTITION, MEM–INDIA–REPUBLIC.)

EXTERNAL INHERITANCE:
From British Raj: INSTITUTIONAL_TRANSFER — administrative and procedural
frameworks, rail, census, codification, parliamentary form. (MEM–INDIA–BRITISH–EMPIRE,
MEM–INDIA–REPUBLIC.)

CONTESTED CLAIMS:
• Kashmir: sovereignty contested with Pakistan; status unresolved since 1947.
• Border and Himalayan interface with China: legacy of British buffer
  assumption and 1950–51 structural break (MEM–INDIA–TIBET; CIV–DOCTRINE–INDIA 04).

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. STRATEGIC POSITION (THREE PERSPECTIVES)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

A) LEGITIMACY AND INSTITUTIONAL CONTINUITY
────────────────────────────────────────────

Indian legitimacy is electoral and civilizational. Authority is judged
by dharmic balance, proportionality, continuity, and order. Key outputs:
DBI (Dharma Balance Index), ECC (Electoral Conversion Capacity), PTC
(Plural Transaction Cost), LHC (Legitimacy–Hardship Coupling). Autonomy
over bloc loyalty is a locked axiom; forced alignment beyond India's
chosen pace elevates continuity risk (CIV–CORE–INDIA Red Lines).

Current legitimacy rests on: federal negotiation as stability engine,
pluralism as structural resilience, and civilizational non-alignment as
natural equilibrium. Vulnerability: externally imposed urgency or
conditionality that can be framed as autonomy surrender degrades
legitimacy even when material gains are offered.

Historical precedent: Nehru's posture toward China admits multiple
encodings (weakness, strategic delay, legitimacy-building, inherited
framework); which encoding India keeps shapes what it learns from 1962.
(Source: CIV–DOCTRINE–INDIA 04; MEM–INDIA–REPUBLIC–NEHRU, MEM–INDIA–TIBET.)

B) POWER DISTRIBUTION AND STRUCTURAL CONSTRAINT
────────────────────────────────────────────

India's structural position: Himalayan shield, Indo-Gangetic demographic
core, Indian Ocean as civilizational corridor. Control of the Ganges
equals civilizational survivability (Doctrine 01); loss of Ganges basin
would constitute civilizational redefinition. Exit-building (corridor
optionality, monetary/logistics/compute diversification) is a meta-doctrine;
narrowing optionality under external pressure is a stress signal.

Current constraints: defence-dominant baseline, dual-front management,
demographic window, industrial replacement and employment absorption.
Time is weaponized — decades tactical, generations operational. Structural
incentive favours multipolarity and corridor diversification; dependence
on a single enforcer or timeline-compression degrades position.
(Source: CIV–CORE–INDIA; CIV–DOCTRINE–INDIA 01; MEM–INDIA–GEO–GANGES–RIVER.)

C) LEADERSHIP LIABILITY AND MECHANISM
────────────────────────────────────────────

Institutional continuity is distributed across federal and administrative
spine; personalist exposure is lower than in highly centralized systems.
Liability attaches to: (1) acceptance of conditionality that can be
framed as autonomy surrender; (2) federal cohesion rupture; (3) narrative
failure (e.g. single encoding of Nehru/1962 imposed as national lesson).
Revealed preference: MEA rejection of "commitment" language on Russian
oil (Feb 2026) while refiners reduced intake — narrative sovereignty
preserved, behaviour aligned with external pressure. Mechanism: who bears
exposure for defection or alignment choices (invader at edge, defender
elites, invader's proxy) shapes jurisdiction (CIV–DOCTRINE–INDIA 02, 03).

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. MATERIAL OPTIONS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

OPTION A: Hold Non-Alignment Line — Resist Conditionality Narrative

  Grounded in: Legitimacy and institutional continuity

  Reasoning: India's Red Line forbids autonomy surrender beyond India's
  chosen pace. Accepting a public narrative of "commitment" to external
  demands (e.g. halting Russian oil) would cross that line even if
  behaviour were similar. Holding the line means: maintain sovereign
  framing of energy and trade decisions; reject linkage of tariff relief
  to formal pledges that constrain future optionality; keep narrative
  and structure aligned with civilizational non-alignment.

  Key Assumptions:
  • External actors will continue to offer conditional benefits
    — Linchpin: YES
  • Domestic legitimacy is sustained by sovereign framing of choices
    — Linchpin: YES
  • Refiners' behaviour can diverge from narrative without fracturing
    legitimacy (sovereignty asserted, market behaviour pragmatic)
    — Linchpin: YES

  Confidence: MODERATE
  Assessed against CIV–CORE–INDIA Red Lines, Doctrine 04 (Nehru
  encodings), and precedent (MEA Feb 2026 rejection of "commitment"
  language; MEM–INDIA–REPUBLIC–NEHRU, MEM–INDIA–REPUBLIC–MODI).
  Binding constraint: whether domestic and international audiences
  continue to accept sovereign framing when behaviour partially
  aligns with external pressure — if framing is seen as hollow,
  legitimacy erodes.

  Risks: Conditional benefits (tariff relief, market access) may be
  withdrawn or delayed; partners may escalate conditionality; India
  may face binary choices that force narrative and behaviour to align
  in a direction that crosses the Red Line.

  Conditions for success: Plural narrative space holds; MEA and
  leadership maintain consistent sovereign rhetoric; refiners' and
  commercial behaviour remain deniable as market-driven.

  Conditions for failure: Public linkage of benefits to specific
  Indian "commitments" becomes undeniable; domestic opposition or
  partners frame India as having surrendered autonomy.

  Discriminating evidence:
  • Watch for: MEA or leadership statements accepting linkage
    language; withdrawal of tariff relief tied to oil imports
  • Signal of failure: Single dominant narrative that India
    "capitulated" or "committed" to external demands

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

OPTION B: Accommodate Conditionality Where Reversible

  Grounded in: Power distribution and structural constraint; legitimacy
  (accommodation as tactical, not identity shift)

  Reasoning: Accept near-term conditionality (e.g. reduced Russian
  oil intake in exchange for tariff relief) when the move is reversible
  and does not lock in long-term bloc alignment. Frame as market and
  diversification choice, not commitment. Preserves optionality to
  resume or shift when conditions change. Structural logic: time and
  demography favour India; short-term accommodation need not surrender
  strategic autonomy if exit ramps remain.

  Key Assumptions:
  • Conditionality is time-bound or reversible (no permanent treaty
    constraint on energy sourcing)
    — Linchpin: YES
  • Reversibility is credible to domestic audience (not framed as
    surrender)
    — Linchpin: YES
  • Benefits (tariff relief, market access) materially outweigh
    cost of reduced optionality in the relevant timeframe
    — Linchpin: NO

  Confidence: LOW
  Assessed against CIV–CORE–INDIA (strategic patience, exit-building),
  and precedent (colonial-era accommodation patterns; MEM–INDIA–BRITISH–
  EMPIRE). Binding constraint: whether accommodation is credibly
  reversible — if conditionality locks in (treaty, institutional
  commitment), the option becomes alignment, not tactic.

  Risks: Reversibility may be perceived as lost once behaviour is
  observed; partners may treat accommodation as precedent for
  further demands; domestic legitimacy may suffer if framed as
  concession.

  Conditions for success: No formal commitment language; behaviour
  can be reversed without treaty breach; benefits are delivered and
  visible.

  Conditions for failure: Conditionality is institutionalized;
  reversal would trigger sanctions or reputational cost that India
  is unwilling to bear.

  Discriminating evidence:
  • Watch for: Formal agreements that tie benefits to specific
    Indian obligations; duration of conditionality
  • Signal of failure: Public framing by partner that India
    "agreed" to long-term constraint

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

OPTION C: Double Down on Exit-Building (Corridors, Optionality)

  Grounded in: Power distribution and structural constraint; legitimacy
  (exit-building as civilizational doctrine)

  Reasoning: Reduce dependence on any single corridor, currency, or
  partner by accelerating exit vectors: INSTC, Chabahar alternatives,
  rupee settlement, compute and supply-chain diversification. Offensive
  optionality reduces leverage of any one enforcer. Doctrine: India
  builds exits; narrowing optionality under pressure is a failure
  mode (CIV–CORE–INDIA XII, DOD-IND).

  Key Assumptions:
  • India can allocate political and fiscal capital to multiple
    corridors and alternatives simultaneously
    — Linchpin: YES
  • Chabahar or equivalent corridor optionality is restorable or
    replaceable (e.g. other Persian Gulf / Central Asia routes)
    — Linchpin: YES
  • External pressure on one corridor does not cascade to others
    — Linchpin: NO

  Confidence: MODERATE
  Assessed against CIV–CORE–INDIA Exit-Building Meta-Doctrine,
  MEM–INDIA–GEO–* (corridor geometry), and current stress (Chabahar
  budget zeroed amid sanctions pressure — CIV–SCHOLAR–INDIA ENTRY 0010).
  Binding constraint: whether fiscal and political capacity to
  sustain multiple exit vectors holds — if exit-building is
  underfunded or blocked, optionality narrows and Option A/B
  become harder.

  Risks: Exit-building is capital-intensive; sanctions or partner
  pressure can target multiple corridors; domestic priorities may
  crowd out corridor investment.

  Conditions for success: Budget and diplomacy support at least
  two viable corridors; no single enforcer can shut all exits.

  Conditions for failure: Corridor options collapse (e.g. Chabahar
  abandoned, INSTC stalled); India faces de facto single-corridor
  or single-currency dependency.

  Discriminating evidence:
  • Watch for: Budget allocations for Chabahar, INSTC, alternative
    ports; rupee settlement volumes; diversification agreements
  • Signal of failure: Consecutive years of zero allocation for
    key corridor; public dependence on single partner for critical
    route

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

OPTION D: Accept Conditionality in Exchange for Near-Term Relief
(Accommodation / Reversal option — duty of competence)

  Grounded in: Leadership liability and mechanism; power (short-term
  gain vs long-term constraint)

  Reasoning: Explicitly accept linkage (e.g. tariff relief conditional
  on reduced Russian oil) and publicly frame as "partnership" or
  "alignment of interests" to secure immediate economic benefit.
  Reverses the sovereign framing of Option A. Included because
  omission would leave the decision-maker blind to a plausible
  path that leadership might choose under fiscal or political
  pressure — and to its consequences.

  Key Assumptions:
  • Near-term relief (tariff, market access, technology) is
    sufficient to justify narrative and behavioural alignment
    — Linchpin: YES
  • Domestic audience can be persuaded that alignment is in
    national interest
    — Linchpin: YES
  • Reversibility is not a requirement for leadership
    — Linchpin: YES

  Confidence: LOW
  Assessed against Red Line (autonomy surrender), MEM–INDIA–REPUBLIC–
  NEHRU (encoding consequences), and ENTRY 0010 (MEA rejected
  "commitment" language). Binding constraint: whether domestic
  legitimacy and civilizational non-alignment axiom can absorb
  public acceptance of conditionality — if not, option triggers
  Red Line and continuity risk.

  Risks: Red Line breach; long-term optionality lost; precedent
  for further conditionality; legitimacy erosion if framed as
  capitulation.

  Conditions for success: Relief is large and visible; framing
  as "partnership" holds; no subsequent escalation of demands.

  Conditions for failure: Demands escalate; domestic opposition
  frames as surrender; optionality is permanently narrowed.

  Discriminating evidence:
  • Watch for: MEA or leadership statements accepting "commitment"
    or "alignment" language; formal agreements with conditionality
  • Signal of failure: Red Line status move to ONE OR MORE AT RISK
    or BREACHED (CIV–CORE–INDIA XVII)

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. COMPLETENESS AUDIT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Three-perspective checklist:
• Legitimacy and institutional continuity: Option A (hold line),
  Option D (reversal); Red Line and sovereign framing applied.
• Power distribution and structural constraint: Option B (reversible
  accommodation), Option C (exit-building); corridor optionality
  and time-weaponization applied.
• Leadership liability and mechanism: Option D (who bears exposure
  for alignment); MEA vs refiners narrative/behaviour split (ENTRY 0010)
  applied.

Material option coverage: Four options (A–D); at least one at
accommodation/reversal end (Option D). No perspective omitted.

Identified gaps: Opponent constraint assessment (Section VI-B) not
applicable for current option set — no single principal opponent
on whom material options depend for relative degradation. If India
enters a decision space where outcomes depend on a specific
adversary's or partner's capacity curve, VI-B must be populated.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. STABILITY INDICATORS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Internal legitimacy stress (CIV–STATE–TEMPLATE § IX):

| Indicator              | Status   | Notes |
|------------------------|----------|-------|
| Ideological coherence  | STABLE   | Civilizational non-alignment and plural cohesion remain dominant |
| Elite cohesion         | STABLE   | No defection or open rupture signals |
| Popular legitimacy     | STABLE   | Electoral conversion capacity intact |
| Institutional function | STABLE   | Federal negotiation and administrative spine functioning |
| Narrative control      | STABLE   | Sovereign framing on trade/oil maintained (MEA Feb 2026) |

Threshold rule: When ≥3 indicators STRESSED or any CRITICAL, legitimacy
and institutional continuity perspective carries elevated weight in
Section IV options. Current: 0/5 STRESSED, 0/5 CRITICAL.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI-B. OPPONENT CONSTRAINT ASSESSMENT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Not applicable for current material options. India's options (hold
line, accommodate, exit-build, accept conditionality) do not depend
on a single principal opponent's capacity degrading relative to
India's. Key relationships (US, China, Russia, Persia) are multi-vector;
no attrition-race binding constraint. If a decision point emerges
where success depends on relative degradation (e.g. outlasting a
specific adversary or partner), Section VI-B will be populated and
binding constraints in Section IV reframed as relative variables.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. DECISION-RELEVANT HISTORY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Patterns derived from CIV–SCHOLAR–INDIA and CIV–DOCTRINE–INDIA;
activation level indicates relevance to current options.

• **Ganges survivability (Doctrine 01 / RLL–INDIA–0001)** — HIGH.
  Control of Ganges = civilizational survivability; loss of Ganges
  = redefinition. Origin (Indus) severable; permanence (Ganges) not.
  Precedents: MEM–INDIA–GEO–GANGES–RIVER, MEM–INDIA–GEO–INDUS–RIVER, MEM–INDIA–
  PARTITION. No current stress on Doctrine 01.

• **Two modes of WAR limit (Doctrine 02 / RLL–INDIA–0002)** — MODERATE.
  Limit via mechanism failure (invader or defender); exposure on
  commander or indigenous polity. Precedents: MEM–INDIA–WAR–ALEXANDER,
  MEM–INDIA–BRITISH–EMPIRE–CLIVE. Informs liability framing (who
  bears exposure) for alignment choices.

• **Three defection types (Doctrine 03)** — MODERATE. Invader at edge,
  defender elites, invader's proxy; jurisdiction shift (e.g. 1857).
  Precedents: MEM–INDIA–BRITISH–EMPIRE–CLIVE, Company→Crown. Relevant
  when assessing defection or alignment by Indian or partner actors.

• **Nehru idealism encodings (Doctrine 04)** — HIGH. Multiple encodings
  (weakness, delay, legitimacy-building, inherited framework); encoding
  shapes learning from 1962. Precedents: MEM–INDIA–REPUBLIC–NEHRU,
  MEM–INDIA–TIBET. Informs sovereign framing vs accommodation
  narrative (Option A vs D).

• **Doctrine stress — trade/oil conditionality, Chabahar (Jan–Feb 2026)**
  — HIGH. US tariff relief conditional on India not resuming Russian
  oil; MEA rejected "commitment" language; refiners reduced intake.
  Chabahar budget zeroed. No formal Doctrine 01 or 04 violation;
  Red Line and exit-building under stress. Source: CIV–SCHOLAR–INDIA
  ENTRY 0010 (relay from STATE-mode doctrine stress assessment).

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VIII. CROSS-ENTITY LINKS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

From CIV–CORE–INDIA XIII (primary interfaces):

| Entity   | Role / dynamic |
|----------|----------------|
| Anglia   | Access and enforcement pressure; conditionality (tariff, oil) |
| China    | Continental-maritime rival/partner; border/Himalayan interface |
| Russia   | Energy and defence hedging; current stress (oil, sanctions) |
| Persia   | Corridor complement; Chabahar under pressure |
| Islam    | Demographic and sacred adjacency |

Key distinction: India's optionality (exit-building, non-alignment)
is tested by Anglia/US conditionality and by corridor pressure
(Persia/Chabahar). China and Russia are hedging partners, not
principal opponents for current option set.
