I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves the **Bhagavad Gita** as India's **synthesis of the three paths** (karma, jnana, bhakti) and as the text that legitimates **action in the world** without attachment—the "Song of the Lord" in which Krishna instructs Arjuna on the eve of Kurukshetra, resolving neither the epic nor the war but offering a portable ethic of disciplined action and devotion.

The Gita is not the Mahabharata. It is **one node** within the epic—embedded in the Bhīṣma Parva—that is extracted, translated, and recited as standalone scripture ("Gitopanishad"). It does not resolve the epic's moral strain; it **intensifies** the question: how does one act when every act carries cost?

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. CONTEXT & FORM
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Gita is a dialogue between Krishna (charioteer, later revealed as divine) and Arjuna (warrior) in the moments before the Kurukshetra battle. Arjuna refuses to fight; Krishna teaches. The frame is martial and political; the content is soteriological and ethical.

Structural conditions:
• **Embedded in epic** — Part of the Mahabharata; the war proceeds after the dialogue. The Gita does not cancel the war; it reframes the actor's stance (act without attachment to fruit).
• **Three yogas synthesized** — Karma yoga (action without desire for result); jnana yoga (knowledge of the self/brahman); bhakti yoga (devotion to the Lord). No single path is exclusive; bhakti is often elevated as the inclusive option.
• **Sanskrit; oral and written** — Transmitted in Sanskrit; later vernacular and global translation. Recited as liturgy and studied as philosophy.
• **No single author** — Attributed to Vyasa (epic poet); redaction and interpolation debated. Function: civilizational, not biographical.

The Gita encodes **legitimacy of action**—not retreat from the world (sannyasa alone) but engagement with discipline and devotion.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. CORE TEACHINGS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• **Nishkama karma** — Act without attachment to the fruit of action (karma phala). Duty (svadharma) performed for its own sake, not for gain. Structural outcome: the warrior may fight; the politician may govern; the actor is not bound by outcome but by right action.
• **Krishna as teacher and divine** — Revelation of Krishna's cosmic form (viśvarūpa); the Lord as the supreme object of knowledge and devotion. Bhakti as path to liberation and as frame for karma and jnana.
• **Svadharma** — One's own duty, by station and nature. Arjuna's dharma is to fight; the Gita does not say the war is good—it says the warrior's duty is to act. Tension with the epic's encoding of war as rupture remains.
• **Equanimity** — Samatva (equanimity); same mind in success and failure. Legitimacy of the actor who is not destabilized by result.

The Gita establishes **portable ethic**: applicable to ruler, soldier, householder, and renunciate. It is extracted from the epic because it travels—Gandhi, Tilak, Nehru, global readers—as a guide to action under uncertainty.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. CIVILIZATIONAL FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The Gita functions as:

• **Bridge between epic and philosophy** — Upanishadic themes (atman, brahman, liberation) in narrative form; epic frame (war, duty) with soteriological content. "Gitopanishad": the Upanishad that sits inside the Mahabharata.
• **Legitimacy of engaged action** — Contrast with pure renunciation (Upanishads, forest tradition): the Gita says act, but act with discipline and devotion. It accommodates the householder and the king.
• **Modern reception** — Gandhi (Gita as gospel of non-violent duty); Tilak (Gita as call to righteous action); Nehru (civilizational symbol). Colonial and post-colonial: the Gita as India's "national scripture" and as global philosophy. Translation and commentary (Schlegel, Emerson, Oppenheimer) extend its reach.
• **Unresolved tension with the epic** — The Mahabharata encodes "war as civilizational rupture"; the Gita does not declare the war just. It declares the **actor's stance** (act without attachment). The epic's moral ambiguity is preserved; the Gita offers a psychology of action, not a verdict on the war.

The Gita is **repressed as sole authority** (Hinduism has no single scripture) but **retained as portable civilizational grammar**—the text Indians and others reach for when asking how to act.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. LIMITS & TENSION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• **Does not resolve the epic** — Krishna's counsel enables Arjuna to fight; it does not say the Kauravas deserve defeat or that the war is good. Victory still brings ash (Mahabharata). The Gita intensifies the question; it does not close it.
• **Instrumentalism** — Krishna's role in the epic (counsellor, strategist, sometimes deceiver) shadows the Gita's high philosophy. Tension between the divine teacher and the epic's amoral necessity.
• **Multiple readings** — Advaita (jnana emphasis); bhakti (devotion primary); karma (action primary). No single orthodox interpretation.
• **Artha vs dharma** — Arthashastra encodes state interest with minimal Gita-style detachment. The Gita supplies **ethic for the actor**; Kautilya supplies **logic for the state**. Same civilization, different registers.

The Gita is **portable but not exclusive**—it persists as guide and symbol while the epic's contradictions remain.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Gita = synthesis of karma, jnana, bhakti; legitimacy of action without attachment.
• Embedded in Mahabharata; extracted as "Gitopanishad"; does not resolve epic.
• Portable ethic—warrior, ruler, householder; nishkama karma, svadharma, bhakti.
• Modern reception: Gandhi, Tilak, Nehru; national and global scripture.
• Tension: Krishna's instrumentalism in epic vs Gita's high philosophy.
• Same civilization: Gita = actor's ethic; Arthashastra = state's logic.

Tension preserved without verdict.

VII. MEM CONNECTIONS (TYPED)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

DEPENDS_ON:
• MEM–INDIA–LIT–MAHABHARATA — Gita embedded in Bhīṣma Parva; epic frame (Kurukshetra, Arjuna's crisis); Gita does not resolve epic, intensifies question.

ENABLES:
• MEM–INDIA–LIT–UPANISHADS — Gita carries Upanishadic themes (atman, brahman, liberation); "Gitopanishad"; karma/jnana/bhakti in narrative form.
• MEM–INDIA–HINDUISM — Dharma, svadharma, bhakti; Gita as one pillar of Hindu textual plurality and civilizational grammar.
• MEM–INDIA–LIT–SANSKRIT — Gita composed and transmitted in Sanskrit; part of the language's scripture layer.

PARALLELS (structural):
• MEM–INDIA–LIT–RAMAYANA — Ideal kingship (Rama) vs Gita's ethic of action under strain; both encode dharma, different narrative frames.
• MEM–INDIA–LIT–ARTHASHASTRA — Gita = ethic for the actor; Arthashastra = logic for the state; same civilization, different registers.

GEOGRAPHIC:
• MEM–INDIA–GEO–GANGES–RIVER — Kurukshetra on Gangetic plain; Gita's dialogue set in epic geography.

VIII. EVIDENCE — ARC-T-MODERN (VERBATIM)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Epic and philosophical continuity are attested [ERC-SECONDARY]:

> Minstrels singing great epics almost as old as Homer, and poets holding world audiences today.

— Will Durant, *Our Oriental Heritage*, Ch. XIV § I (1935) [ARC–INDIA-T-MODERN]. The Mahabharata (and the Gita within it) are part of that epic tradition.
