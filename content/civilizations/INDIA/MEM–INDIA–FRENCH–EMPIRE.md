I. MEMORY PURPOSE & SCOPE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file preserves **France's presence in India** as a **comptoir-based colonial project** that briefly contested British expansion (Carnatic Wars, Dupleix vs Clive) and then **collapsed** with the Seven Years' War and the Treaty of Paris (1763). The French Compagnie des Indes orientales held coastal enclaves—Pondicherry, Chandannagar (Chandernagor), Karikal, Mahé, Yanam—and attempted to project influence into Indian politics through alliance and subsidy. Naval inferiority and multi-theatre overextension decided the outcome: French India as a **political-military project** ends in 1763; the comptoirs are returned to France (demilitarized) and retained until their transfer to the Indian Union (1954).

For India, the French empire encodes **the European rival that lost**—the power that, with Portugal and Britain, was drawn to 18th-century India's wealth (Durant: "commercial pirates of England and France") but that failed to sustain a territorial or revenue presence. French India is enclave and ambition, then retreat.

Contradictions are preserved without synthesis.

II. ENTRY: COMPAGNIE DES INDES AND COMPTOIRS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The French East India Company (Compagnie française des Indes orientales) is chartered in the 17th century. French comptoirs (trading posts) are established along the Indian coast:

• **Pondicherry** (Puducherry) — Coromandel coast; founded 1674 (after earlier attempts); principal French seat in India; governor-general of French India.
• **Chandannagar** (Chandernagor) — Bengal; on the Hooghly; trading post; contested with the British (Calcutta nearby).
• **Karikal** — Coromandel; south of Pondicherry.
• **Mahé** — Malabar coast (Kerala).
• **Yanam** — Andhra coast (Godavari delta).

The model is **enclave and trade**, not territorial conquest—similar in structure to Portuguese strongholds, but with a company (Compagnie) rather than a vice-royalty (Estado da Índia). French presence grows in the early 18th century; governors such as **Joseph François Dupleix** (Pondicherry, 1742–1754) pursue alliance with Indian princes and intervention in succession disputes, aiming to secure revenue and pre-eminence over the British East India Company.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. RIVALRY WITH THE BRITISH: CARNATIC WARS AND DUPLEIX VS CLIVE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The mid-18th century brings open conflict between French and British companies and their Indian allies:

• **Carnatic Wars** (1740s–1760s) — Fought in the Carnatic (southeast India); French and British back rival claimants to the Nizamate of Hyderabad and the Nawabdom of the Carnatic. Dupleix's strategy: use French troops and subsidies to place client rulers in power and extract revenue and influence. British response: Robert Clive and the EIC defeat the Nawab of Bengal at Plassey (1757) and consolidate in Bengal; French-backed positions in the Carnatic are progressively undermined.
• **Structural asymmetry** — Both sides rely on Indian allies, limited European troops, and fiscal leverage. British naval superiority and the ability to reinforce and supply by sea prove decisive. French India cannot be sustained when the Royal Navy dominates the Indian Ocean and when France is simultaneously committed in Europe, North America, and the Caribbean (Seven Years' War).

The Durant quote (ARC–INDIA-T-MODERN) frames the moment: "the wealth of eighteenth century India which attracted the commercial pirates of England and France." The French were **one of two** European commercial-military actors in the theatre; they lost the contest.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. SEVEN YEARS' WAR AND TREATY OF PARIS (1763)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The **Seven Years' War** (1756–1763) is fought in Europe, North America, the Caribbean, and **India**. For Francia, the war is encoded as "decisive global legitimacy shock" (MEM–FRANCIA–WAR–SEVEN–YEARS): multi-theatre overextension, naval inferiority, and fiscal strain. Outcomes in India:

• **Collapse of French India** — British forces take Pondicherry (1761); French military and political presence in India is broken. The Treaty of Paris (1763) returns the **comptoirs** to France but under strict limits: they may not be fortified or garrisoned for military use. French India as a **projection of power** is over.
• **Choiseul's diagnosis** — The Duc de Choiseul, negotiating for France, frames the loss in systemic terms: "We have lost America not in the forests of Canada, but on the seas, where we were never strong enough to contest England's mastery; and it is there, rather than in Europe, that the fate of empires is now decided, by ships, commerce, and the credit that sustains them." The same logic applies to India: empire was decided **at sea**, not in the comptoirs alone.

French India survives only as **trading posts** without territorial or military ambition. The British EIC proceeds to consolidate revenue and administration in Bengal and beyond; the French do not.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. AFTERMATH: COMPTOIRS RETAINED, THEN TRANSFERRED
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
After 1763, France retains the five comptoirs (Pondicherry, Chandannagar, Karikal, Mahé, Yanam) as commercial enclaves. They are occupied by the British again during the Napoleonic Wars and restored to France in 1816. They remain French until **1954**, when they are **transferred** to the Indian Union (de facto; treaty of cession 1962). No armed annexation—unlike Goa (1961)—because France negotiates the handover after Indian independence.

For India, the French comptoirs encode **late European holdouts** alongside Portuguese Goa: small coastal territories that outlast the British Raj but are reintegrated into India within a decade of independence. The **mode** of end differs: Goa = annexation (1961); French India = negotiated transfer (1954).

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. CIVILIZATIONAL FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
For India, the French empire functions as:

• **The rival that lost** — France and Britain both sought wealth and influence in 18th-century India; British naval and fiscal capacity and the Clive–Plassey sequence determined the outcome. French India is the **road not taken**—European colonial presence without British-style territorial revenue state.
• **Enclave, not province** — Like the Portuguese, the French held **comptoirs**, not hinterland. Unlike the British, they did not convert commercial presence into a subcontinental administrative empire. After 1763 they did not even retain a military option.
• **Global war, local outcome** — French India's fate is decided in a **global** war (Seven Years' War) and by **maritime** asymmetry (Choiseul). The MEM links to MEM–FRANCIA–WAR–SEVEN–YEARS and MEM–FRANCIA–EMPIRE for the French-side encoding.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. LIMITS & TENSION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• **No French territorial empire in India** — The French never built a Bengal-style revenue or administrative system. Their maximum reach was alliance and subsidy (Dupleix); after 1763 it was trade only.
• **Contrast with Portuguese** — Portuguese India (Goa) outlasted British India and was ended by annexation (1961). French India outlasted British India and was ended by negotiated transfer (1954). Both are enclave endings; the **mechanism** of decolonization differs.
• **Durant's framing** — "Commercial pirates of England and France" places both in the same moral frame; the MEM does not resolve that frame but encodes the structural fact that France was present and then defeated in the contest.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VIII. CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (RAW)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• French India = comptoirs (Pondicherry, Chandannagar, Karikal, Mahé, Yanam); Compagnie des Indes; no territorial empire.
• Rivalry with British EIC; Dupleix vs Clive; Carnatic Wars; Plassey and British consolidation.
• Seven Years' War; Treaty of Paris 1763; collapse of French India as political project; comptoirs returned, demilitarized.
• Empire decided at sea (Choiseul); French India = the European rival that lost.
• Comptoirs retained until 1954 (transfer to India); contrast with Goa (annexation 1961).

Tension preserved without verdict.

IX. MEM CONNECTIONS (TYPED)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

ENABLES:
• MEM–INDIA–BRITISH–EMPIRE — British EIC consolidates as French India collapses; Clive and Plassey; British territorial-revenue model wins.
• MEM–INDIA–BRITISH–EMPIRE–CLIVE — Clive's campaigns and Plassey (1757) occur in the same theatre as French–British rivalry; Durant: "commercial pirates of England and France."
• MEM–INDIA–BRITISH–EMPIRE–CALCUTTA — Bengal and Calcutta as British seat; Chandannagar (French) nearby on Hooghly; British prevail.

PARALLELS (structural):
• MEM–INDIA–PORTUGAL–EMPIRE — Both enclave-based; Portuguese hold Goa to 1961 (annexation); French hold comptoirs to 1954 (transfer). French lost political contest in 1763; Portuguese never contested for subcontinent.
• MEM–INDIA–BRITISH–EMPIRE — Contrast: British = territorial, revenue, administrative; French = comptoir, ambition, then collapse.
• MEM–FRANCIA–WAR–SEVEN–YEARS — Seven Years' War; India as theatre; "Collapse of French India"; Treaty of Paris 1763; Choiseul.
• MEM–FRANCIA–EMPIRE — First Colonial Empire (1534–1763): Americas, India, Caribbean; 1763 loss of Canada and French India.

X. EVIDENCE — ARC-T-MODERN (VERBATIM)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
18th-century India as object of French and British commercial-military interest [ERC-SECONDARY]:

> Those who have seen the unspeakable poverty and physiological weakness of the Hindus today will hardly believe that it was the wealth of eighteenth century India which attracted the commercial pirates of England and France.

— Will Durant, *The Case for India* (1930) [ARC–INDIA-T-MODERN].

Francia-side: empire decided at sea (MEM–FRANCIA–WAR–SEVEN–YEARS):

> We have lost America not in the forests of Canada, but on the seas, where we were never strong enough to contest England's mastery; and it is there, rather than in Europe, that the fate of empires is now decided, by ships, commerce, and the credit that sustains them.

— Duc de Choiseul, correspondence, 1763.
