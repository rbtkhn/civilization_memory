**DERIVATION CLAUSE (BINDING):**
This doctrine registry is **derived exclusively from CIV–SCHOLAR–INDIA**. All doctrines originate from FROZEN SYNTHESIS entries in that file and were accepted via DIB–INDIA (explicit user authorization 2026-02-14 to create this file and to treat the four frozen syntheses as doctrine). No doctrine originates in this file. Doctrines 01–04 correspond to SCHOLAR–INDIA SYNTHESIS 0001, 0002, 0003, 0004. Subsequent doctrines must follow the standard admissibility chain: FROZEN SYNTHESIS in CIV–SCHOLAR–INDIA → DIB–INDIA → CIV–DOCTRINE–INDIA.

I. PURPOSE & AUTHORITY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file is the **exclusive registry of accepted India civilizational doctrines**.

It contains:
• Doctrines explicitly accepted via DIB–INDIA
• Definitions suitable for CIV–CORE citation (CIV–CORE–INDIA v3.3)
• No learning history, no beliefs, no provisional or rejected doctrines (see Section IV)

This file does NOT learn, does NOT synthesize, does NOT evolve autonomously.

Authority Flow:
CIV–MEM–CORE → CIV–CORE–INDIA → DIB–INDIA → CIV–DOCTRINE–INDIA
Source of doctrine content: CIV–SCHOLAR–INDIA (frozen syntheses only).

Doctrine Admissibility Rules (per CIV–DOCTRINE–TEMPLATE § III):
A doctrine MAY be entered here ONLY if: (1) it originates from a FROZEN SYNTHESIS in CIV–SCHOLAR–INDIA; (2) it was explicitly accepted by DIB–INDIA; (3) a doctrine number/version is assigned. Prohibited: draft doctrines, candidate beliefs, analytical hypotheses, scholar commentary, historical narration.

Only doctrines listed here may be cited as **authoritative doctrine** by CIV–CORE engines.

II. DOCTRINAL RELATIONSHIP & SEQUENCING OVERVIEW (NON-AUTHORITATIVE)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Contextual guidance only. No binding order or requirement.

• Doctrine 01 (Ganges Survivability — Origin vs Permanence) — Indus encodes origin; Ganges encodes permanence; loss of Ganges = civilizational redefinition; control of Ganges = civilizational survivability.
• Doctrine 02 (Two Modes of WAR Limit) — India WAR limit encodes invader's mechanism fails (exposure on commander) or defender's mechanism fails (exposure on indigenous polity); civilizational endurance preserved in both.
• Doctrine 03 (Three Defection Types) — Extends 02: invader at edge, defender elites, invader's proxy (e.g. 1857); jurisdiction and exposure shift by type.
• Doctrine 04 (Nehru Idealism — Alternative Encodings) — Nehru's posture toward China admits multiple encodings (weakness, strategic delay, legitimacy-building, inherited framework, cost of autonomy); encoding shapes what India learns from 1962.

Temporal relation: 01–03 address structural/geographic and WAR-limit patterns; 04 addresses modern republic encoding. No mandatory application order.

III. DOCTRINE REGISTRY (AUTHORITATIVE)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

DOCTRINE 01
Name: GANGES SURVIVABILITY — ORIGIN VS PERMANENCE
Status: ACCEPTED · LOCKED · CANONICAL
Source:
• CIV–SCHOLAR–INDIA (SYNTHESIS 0001)

Definition:
Indus and Ganges encode distinct civilizational functions—origin spine vs enduring heartland. Loss of origin basin (Indus) is survivable without civilizational redefinition; loss of heartland basin (Ganges) is not. Control of the Ganges equals civilizational survivability. Partition (1947) severs Indus from Indian sovereignty; Ganges basin remains; the dual pattern stands.

Operational Meaning:
• GEO–MEM and continuity analysis must distinguish origin (Indus) from permanence (Ganges).
• Loss of Ganges basin = civilizational redefinition; loss of Indus = survivable with memory outlasting territory.
• RLL–INDIA–0001 binds this constraint for Phase II.

Hard Constraints:
• If Ganges were severed and India survived as India without redefinition, doctrine would be falsified.
• If Indus and Ganges were interchangeable, dual-pattern structure would collapse.
• If origin and permanence encoding were reversed in MEM corpus, doctrine scope would narrow.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

DOCTRINE 02
Name: TWO MODES OF WAR LIMIT — MECHANISM FAILURE AND EXPOSURE
Status: ACCEPTED · LOCKED · CANONICAL
Source:
• CIV–SCHOLAR–INDIA (SYNTHESIS 0002)

Definition:
India WAR limit encodes two modes—invader's mechanism fails (exposure on commander) or defender's mechanism fails (exposure on indigenous polity). Same question (who was exposed when the mechanism failed), opposite answers. Limit is encoded via mechanism failure, not decisive field defeat. Civilizational endurance is preserved in both (intact or delayed, not erased).

Operational Meaning:
• When assessing India WAR MEMs, apply locus test: invader's mechanism (e.g. Alexander at Hyphasis) vs defender's mechanism (e.g. Clive/Plassey).
• Exposure falls on commander (invader) or on indigenous polity/elites (defender).
• RLL–INDIA–0002 binds this constraint for Phase II.

Hard Constraints:
• If decisive field defeat were primary encoding, doctrine would be mis-specified.
• If both loci could fail simultaneously or neither, pattern would break.
• If India were "erased" in either mode, doctrine would fail.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

DOCTRINE 03
Name: THREE DEFECTION TYPES
Status: ACCEPTED · LOCKED · CANONICAL
Source:
• CIV–SCHOLAR–INDIA (SYNTHESIS 0003)

Definition:
Three defection types extend the two-mode frame: (1) invader at edge—invader's army refuses, exposure on commander; (2) defender elites—defender's polity fragments, exposure on indigenous elites; (3) invader's proxy—invader's local force defects against invader (e.g. 1857), exposure on imperial mechanism. Type 3 adds jurisdiction shift (e.g. Company→Crown). Pattern extends Doctrine 02 without contradicting it.

Operational Meaning:
• When assessing defection in Indian military history, classify locus: invader at edge, defender elites, or invader's proxy.
• Invader's proxy defection shifts jurisdiction and liability to the invader's chain of command.
• 1857 encodes type 3; Plassey encodes type 2; Hyphasis encodes type 1.

Hard Constraints:
• If 1857 were type 2 (defender elites), third type would be redundant; doctrine would over-count.
• If three types contradicted two-mode frame, doctrine would be inconsistent.
• If ARC contradicted (e.g. 1857 as defender victory), doctrine would weaken.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

DOCTRINE 04
Name: NEHRU IDEALISM — ALTERNATIVE ENCODINGS
Status: ACCEPTED · LOCKED · CANONICAL
Source:
• CIV–SCHOLAR–INDIA (SYNTHESIS 0004)

Definition:
Nehru's idealism toward China admits multiple encodings—weakness, strategic delay, legitimacy-building, inherited framework (British buffer assumption), cost of autonomy. No single encoding is mandatory. Which encoding India keeps shapes what it learns from 1962. MEM–INDIA–TIBET supports inherited-framework encoding (1950–51 rupture = structural break). Tension preserved; no resolution.

Operational Meaning:
• When assessing Nehru-era posture toward China, do not impose single encoding; document alternatives.
• Encoding implications: "don't be idealistic" vs "don't defer without building capacity" vs "autonomy has a price."
• Inherited-framework encoding: British buffer assumption; rupture = structural, not only personal.

Hard Constraints:
• If single encoding were mandatory, doctrine would be over-specified.
• If encoding had no consequence for learning, doctrine would be trivial.
• If MEM–INDIA–TIBET contradicted inherited-framework encoding, doctrine would be inconsistent.

IV. EXPLICITLY EXCLUDED MATERIAL
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
No doctrines have been rejected at this stage. All doctrines in this registry were accepted from CIV–SCHOLAR–INDIA frozen syntheses via DIB–INDIA 2026-02-14. Candidate beliefs, staged beliefs, and unfrozen syntheses in SCHOLAR–INDIA are not doctrine and are excluded from this file.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. MIRRORING
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Per CIV–MEM–CORE § XVII and CIV–DOCTRINE–TEMPLATE § VIII:
CIV–DOCTRINE–INDIA is mirrored verbatim into CIV–CORE–INDIA and CIV–SCHOLAR–INDIA. Mirrored doctrines provide citation surface for CIV–CORE engines and inform SCHOLAR learning without constraining it. This file remains the single source of truth for doctrine definitions.
