I. PURPOSE & AUTHORITY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
DEFINING STATEMENT:
**COUNSEL learns from the present.** It analyses current events
through historically-grounded patterns. It serves the decision-maker's
need for structured options.

(Contrast: **SCHOLAR learns from the past.** It extracts patterns
from historical sources across civilizational time. It serves the
system's accumulated understanding.)

The temporal distinction is primary. SCHOLAR and COUNSEL have different
inputs (historical sources vs current events), different temporal
orientations (centuries vs weeks-to-years), different learning dynamics
(pattern extraction vs situation tracking), and different update rhythms
(when new historical analysis is completed vs when the situation changes).
The audience distinction (system-internal vs decision-maker) and the
register distinction (system terminology vs professional language) follow
from the temporal orientation — they are consequences, not definitions.

Governing principle: **Equip, don't advise.**
The system presents structured options grounded in competing analytical
perspectives. The decision-maker navigates; accountability lives with
the choice, not the analysis.

COUNSEL files:
• Present competing analytical perspectives without resolving them
• Ground each option in explicit reasoning with stated assumptions
• Signal when evidence strongly favors one outcome
• Preserve contradictions between perspectives as decision-relevant
• Use professional language throughout — no system-internal terminology

COUNSEL files do NOT:
• Recommend a single course of action
• Resolve tensions between analytical perspectives
• Use system-internal vocabulary (see Section XI: Register Rules)
• Replace CIV–SCHOLAR, CIV–CORE, or CIV–DOCTRINE files

Authority:
COUNSEL is derived from, and downstream of, CIV–CORE and CIV–SCHOLAR.
No content in COUNSEL may contradict canonical CIV–CORE axioms or
accepted doctrines. COUNSEL translates analytical depth into
decision-relevant form; it does not generate new analysis independently.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. AUDIENCE & REGISTER
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
COUNSEL files are written for a **decision-maker** who has not studied
the CMC's internal governance.

The reader should be able to understand any COUNSEL file without
knowing what a MEM, RLL, MIND profile, OGE, ARC, or tri-frame is.

REGISTER RULES:
• Use professional analytical language throughout
• Translate all system-internal concepts into plain equivalents
• Name analytical perspectives by their content, not their profile names
• Citation of source files is permitted (e.g. "Source: MEM–RUSSIA–PETER")
  but internal governance terms must not appear in analytical prose

TRANSLATION TABLE (for system use during file production):

| Internal Term | External Equivalent |
|---------------|---------------------|
| Mercouris lens / MIND | Legitimacy and institutional continuity perspective |
| Mearsheimer lens / MIND | Power distribution and structural constraint perspective |
| Barnes lens / MIND | Leadership liability and mechanism perspective |
| Tri-frame | Three-perspective analysis |
| OGE | Structured options |
| RLL | Recurring pattern / historical rule |
| Polyphonic tension | Preserved contradictions / unresolved tensions |
| POST-BARNES | After liability analysis |
| Blend Law | Content proportion rule |
| ARC | Source hierarchy |
| MEM (in prose) | Historical memory / source file |

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. DUTY OF COMPETENCE (BINDING)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Every CIV–COUNSEL file carries the following obligation:

DUTY OF COMPETENCE DECLARATION (must appear in file header):

  "This file is subject to a completeness standard. The system's
  obligation is to surface all material options identifiable through
  the application of three analytical perspectives: legitimacy and
  institutional continuity; power distribution and structural
  constraint; and leadership liability and mechanism. Failure to
  apply any perspective constitutes a completeness violation."

DEFINITIONS:
• **Material option**: An option whose omission would leave the
  decision-maker blind to a plausible outcome with significant
  consequences.
• **Completeness**: All three analytical perspectives have been applied;
  each has produced at least one option or an explicit finding of
  "no distinct option from this perspective."
• **Violation**: A perspective was not applied, or a material option
  identifiable through any perspective was omitted.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. FILE STRUCTURE (MANDATORY SECTIONS)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Every CIV–COUNSEL file MUST contain the following sections in order:

HEADER
  • File name, version, status
  • Entity name, classification, active/concluded status
  • Duty of competence declaration
  • Last updated date

SECTION I: ENTITY IDENTIFICATION

SECTION III: STRATEGIC POSITION (THREE PERSPECTIVES)
  • Legitimacy and institutional continuity assessment
  • Power distribution and structural constraint assessment
  • Leadership liability and mechanism assessment
  • Tensions between perspectives (preserved, not resolved)

SECTION IV: MATERIAL OPTIONS
  • Minimum 3 structured options

    confidence level, risks, success conditions, failure conditions,
    discriminating evidence
  • Confidence signaling (see Section VII)

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. ENTITY CLASSIFICATION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Every entity in a COUNSEL file must be classified as one of:

| Classification | Definition | Examples |
|----------------|------------|----------|
| CIVILIZATION-STATE | Active state claiming continuous civilizational identity; internal phases within one entity | Russia, China, Iran, India |
| STANDARD-STATE | Active state with heritage links but no civilizational identity claim | France, Germany, USA, UK |
| FRAGMENTED-SOURCE | Concluded entity whose inheritance fragments across multiple successors | Roman Empire, Mongol Empire |
| SUCCESSOR-STATE | Active state with contested relationship to a predecessor | Turkey, Greece |

Classification affects analytical operations:
• CIVILIZATION-STATE: Track legitimacy grammar across phases
• STANDARD-STATE: Track heritage without civilizational claims
• FRAGMENTED-SOURCE: Track inheritance flows outward to successors
• SUCCESSOR-STATE: Track contested claims inward from predecessors

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. SUCCESSION LINK TYPES
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Succession links in Section II use the following typed relationships:

| Type | Definition |
|------|------------|
| DIRECT_CONTINUATION | Same political entity across state-form changes |
| IDEOLOGICAL_CLAIM | Successor claims ideological inheritance (e.g. Third Rome) |
| CONQUEST_ABSORPTION | Successor absorbed predecessor through conquest |
| CULTURAL_INHERITANCE | Successor inherited cultural patterns without political continuity |
| PARTIAL_ABSORPTION | Predecessor's patterns absorbed during period of domination |
| INSTITUTIONAL_TRANSFER | Specific institutions transferred to successor |
| LINGUISTIC_INHERITANCE | Language family continuity |
| CONTESTED | Multiple entities claim same inheritance; unresolved |

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. MATERIAL OPTION FORMAT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Each material option in Section IV MUST follow this structure:

OPTION [LETTER]: [Title]

  Grounded in: [Which analytical perspective(s)]
  
  Reasoning: [Why this path is plausible — 2-4 sentences]
  
  Key Assumptions:
  • [Assumption 1] — Linchpin: [YES/NO]
  • [Assumption 2] — Linchpin: [YES/NO]
  • [Assumption 3] — Linchpin: [YES/NO]
  (Minimum 3 assumptions. Linchpin = if falsified, option collapses.)
  
  Confidence: [HIGH / MODERATE / LOW]
  (HIGH = structural logic strongly favors this outcome;
   MODERATE = plausible under stated assumptions;
   LOW = possible but depends on multiple uncertain conditions)
  
  Grounding: [MANDATORY — one to two sentences immediately after
  confidence level. Names the historical precedents assessed and
  identifies the single binding constraint. See Section VII.A for
  methodology.]
  
  Risks: [What goes wrong if chosen — 2-3 sentences]
  
  Conditions for success: [When this path works]
  
  Conditions for failure: [When this path fails]
  
  Discriminating evidence: [What observable evidence would confirm
  or disconfirm this option's assumptions — 1-3 specific indicators]

MINIMUM: 3 options per COUNSEL file.
MAXIMUM: No fixed limit, but each option must be material.

VII.A GROUNDING LINES AND BINDING CONSTRAINTS (MANDATORY)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Every material option MUST include a grounding line immediately
after the confidence level. The grounding line signals analytical
discipline to the reader without exposing internal diagnostic
machinery.

GROUNDING LINE FORMAT:
"Assessed against [named constraints/evidence] and [N] historical
precedents ([named precedents]). Binding constraint: [single variable]
— [why it binds: consequence if falsified]."

BINDING CONSTRAINT IDENTIFICATION:
The binding constraint is selected by applying two criteria in sequence:

1. SPEED OF COLLAPSE: Among the linchpin assumptions, which one —
   if falsified — collapses the option fastest? The binding constraint
   is the variable with the shortest time-to-collapse.

2. LEAST CONTROLLABLE (tiebreaker): Among assumptions with similar
   collapse speeds, the binding constraint is the one the entity has
   the least ability to influence.

RULES:
• Exactly one binding constraint per option
• The binding constraint must be drawn from the linchpin assumptions
• Historical precedents must be named (not counted abstractly)
• No numerical indicator counts (e.g. "3 of 4 indicators support")
  — this creates false quantitative precision. The system's diagnostic
  indicators are qualitative assessments, not measurements.
• The grounding line tells the reader: what evidence was assessed,
  what would flip the conclusion, and how fast

RATIONALE:
The decision-maker cannot monitor twenty assumptions simultaneously.
The binding constraint is the single variable they should be watching
above all others for each option — the one that, if it moves, changes
everything.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VIII. CONFIDENCE SIGNALING
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Adapted from intelligence tradecraft (Analysis of Competing Hypotheses):

| Level | Meaning | Usage |
|-------|---------|-------|
| HIGH | Structural logic strongly favors this outcome; multiple evidence streams converge | Use sparingly; signals near-certainty under stated assumptions |
| MODERATE | Plausible under stated assumptions; some supporting evidence | Default level for most options |
| LOW | Possible but depends on multiple uncertain conditions | Flag as speculative; include because omission would be a completeness violation |

RULES:
• At least one option should be MODERATE or higher
• HIGH confidence requires explicit structural reasoning
• LOW confidence options are included for completeness, not emphasis
• Confidence applies to the option's plausibility, not its desirability

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IX. STABILITY INDICATORS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Section VI of each COUNSEL file must track indicators of internal
legitimacy stress. When internal stress is elevated, the legitimacy
and institutional continuity perspective carries elevated analytical
weight — because during internal stress, a gap opens between what
the state can do and what the state will do.

INDICATOR CATEGORIES:
• Ideological coherence (can the regime justify its own existence?)
• Elite cohesion (are insiders defecting or positioning to defect?)
• Popular legitimacy (does the population accept the regime's claims?)
• Institutional function (are state institutions performing or decaying?)
• Narrative control (is the regime's story holding or fragmenting?)

STATUS LEVELS:
• STABLE — No significant stress signals
• STRESSED — Indicators present but contained
• CRITICAL — Multiple indicators active; gap between capability and
  willingness likely

THRESHOLD RULE:
When ≥3 indicators are STRESSED or any indicator is CRITICAL,
the legitimacy and institutional continuity perspective carries
elevated predictive weight in Section IV options.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
X. REVISION PROTOCOL
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
When new evidence falsifies a linchpin assumption in a material option:

1. Change option status: ACTIVE → UNDER_REVIEW
2. Document trigger: What evidence changed
3. Re-assess assumptions: Update Key Assumptions
4. Re-evaluate confidence: Adjust confidence level
5. Record in Counsel Log (Section IX of COUNSEL file)

REVISION RECORD FORMAT:
  Option: [Letter]
  Prior Status: ACTIVE
  Trigger: [What changed]
  Date: [YYYY-MM-DD]
  Key Change: [What shifted]
  New Confidence: [Level]
  Re-assessment: [COMPLETE / PENDING]

All revisions must be documented. Silent changes to options are
prohibited.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
XI. REGISTER RULES (BINDING)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
CIV–COUNSEL files are external-facing. The following terms MUST NOT
appear in the analytical prose of any COUNSEL file:

PROHIBITED IN PROSE:
• MIND (as system term)
• OGE / Option Generation Engine
• Tri-frame / tri-frame analysis
• POST-BARNES / post-catalyst
• Blend Law / Proportional Blend
• DEF / Doctrinal Eligibility Filter
• DIB / Doctrine Intake Buffer
• SCL / Scholar Confidence Level
• RLL (use "recurring pattern" or cite the specific pattern by name)
• Polyphonic tension (use "preserved contradictions" or "unresolved tensions")
• Catalyst sequence

PROHIBITED QUANTITATIVE PATTERNS:
• "3 of 4 indicators support..." — false measurement precision
• "85% of evidence suggests..." — fabricated quantification
• Any numerical count of diagnostic indicators supporting/opposing
  an assessment, unless the underlying data is genuinely quantitative

PERMITTED:
• File names as source citations (e.g. "Source: MEM–RUSSIA–PETER")
• "CIV–CORE" and "CIV–SCHOLAR" as source references only
• Entity classification terms (CIVILIZATION-STATE, etc.)
• Succession link types (IDEOLOGICAL_CLAIM, etc.)
• Named historical precedent counts (e.g. "five historical precedents")
  — naming them is verifiable; counting unnamed indicators is not

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
XII. RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER FILE TYPES
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
CIV–COUNSEL is PARALLEL to CIV–SCHOLAR, not subordinate to it.
They are distinguished primarily by temporal orientation.

| File Type | Temporal Orientation | Learns From | Audience | Writes To |
|-----------|---------------------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| CIV–SCHOLAR | Past (centuries) | Historical sources, MEMs | System | CIV–DOCTRINE (via DIB) |
| CIV–COUNSEL | Present (weeks–years) | Current events, news, observable indicators | Decision-maker | — |
| CIV–CORE | Persistent | — (constrained by SCHOLAR/DOCTRINE) | System | — |
| CIV–DOCTRINE | Frozen | — (accepted from SCHOLAR) | System | CIV–CORE (citations) |

DIRECTIONALITY:
• SCHOLAR's historical patterns inform COUNSEL's analytical framework
  (via Decision-Relevant History and sync command)
• COUNSEL's current-events analysis does NOT flow back into SCHOLAR
  (SCHOLAR only learns from historical analysis)
• The present becomes history eventually, but SCHOLAR does not
  process it until it does
• Sync is one-way: "sync counsel to scholar" updates COUNSEL's
  historical-pattern foundation; it never moves current-events
  learning backward into SCHOLAR

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
XIII. COMPLETENESS AUDIT CHECKLIST
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Before finalizing any CIV–COUNSEL file:

- [ ] Legitimacy and institutional continuity perspective applied?
- [ ] Power distribution and structural constraint perspective applied?
- [ ] Leadership liability and mechanism perspective applied?
- [ ] Each perspective produced at least one material option
      (or explicit "no distinct option" finding)?
- [ ] Tensions between perspectives preserved, not resolved?
- [ ] Confidence signaled where structural logic strongly favors
      one outcome?
- [ ] Grounding line present for every option (named precedents +
      binding constraint, no false indicator counts)?
- [ ] Binding constraint identified per option using speed-of-collapse
      and least-controllable criteria?
- [ ] No material option omitted that any perspective would surface?
- [ ] Key assumptions stated for every option (≥3 per option)?
- [ ] Linchpin assumptions identified?
- [ ] Discriminating evidence documented for every option?
- [ ] Stability indicators assessed?
- [ ] All prose in external-facing register (no system-internal terms)?
- [ ] Duty of competence declaration present in header?
- [ ] Source files cited where relevant?

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
XIV. SYNC PROTOCOL
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
COUNSEL files are derived from CIV–CORE, CIV–SCHOLAR, CIV–DOCTRINE,
and MEM files. When these sources are updated, COUNSEL may become
stale.

SYNC MECHANISM:
• No automatic triggers or flags
• User manually issues "sync counsel to scholar" command
• System compares current source versions to those in the COUNSEL
  file's Source Versions block
• System identifies changes since last sync that are relevant to
  material options, binding constraints, or stability indicators
• System proposes updates for user approval
• Approved changes are applied; Source Versions block and Counsel
  Log are updated

SOURCE VERSIONS BLOCK (MANDATORY):
Every COUNSEL file must include a Source Versions section listing
the version of each source file it was last assessed against.

SYNC PROCEDURE:
1. Read Source Versions from COUNSEL file
2. Compare to current versions of CIV–CORE, CIV–SCHOLAR,
   CIV–DOCTRINE, and MEM corpus
3. Identify substantive changes (new RLLs, new doctrines, revised
   syntheses, new MEMs with pattern relevance)
4. Assess whether changes affect any: material option reasoning,
   linchpin assumption, binding constraint, stability indicator,
   or cross-entity link
5. Propose specific updates to affected sections
6. Apply only with user approval
7. Update Source Versions block and Counsel Log

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
XV. VERSIONING
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Per CMC 3.1 Version Decoupling:
• COUNSEL files declare content version only
• Increment version when analytical content changes, options are
  revised, or new options are added
• Do not increment for governance changes
