────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
UPGRADE DECLARATION (v2.2 → v2.3 ALIGNMENT PATCH)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This version preserves ALL authority hierarchy, learning safeguards,
lock semantics, and non-synthesis rules from CIV–SCHOLAR–TEMPLATE v2.2.

  (resolves apparent tension with PROTOCOL v2.1 synthesis permissions)
• Compatibility reference updated to current template versions

No authority is weakened.
No phase boundary is relaxed.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
UPGRADE DECLARATION (v2.1 → v2.2 CONTINUITY CARRY-FORWARD)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
v2.2 introduced:

• SCHOLAR ↔ MEM Conflict Handling (Anomaly Flag Protocol)

v2.1 introduced integration with new architecture protocols:

• Communication Register Protocol integration (LEARN mode prose style)
• Ephemeral Observation Layer support (CEO/EOR handling)
• OGE systematization for LEARN mode
• Cross-reference to EPHEMERAL–OBSERVATION–PROTOCOL

This upgrade is ADDITIVE. No existing rules are modified.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
UPGRADE DECLARATION (v2.0)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This version preserves ALL authority hierarchy, learning safeguards,
lock semantics, and non-synthesis rules from CIV–SCHOLAR–TEMPLATE v1.9.1.

v2.0 introduces a new governance tier, promoted from proven
operational practice to canonical system law:

• Formal Scholar Phase Model (Accumulation → Constraint → Snapshot)
• Recursive Learning Ledger (RLL) elevation to binding authority
• Failure-first and negative-capability reasoning as enforceable defaults
• Snapshot class for externalization and archival persistence
• Explicit prohibition of synthesis during Constraint Phase
• Civilization-scoped phase promotion (no global auto-upgrade)

This upgrade is ADDITIVE in authority but MAJOR in system capability.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
I. PURPOSE & AUTHORITY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This template governs the behavior, permissions, constraints, and
learning boundaries of all CIV–SCHOLAR files.

A CIV–SCHOLAR file is:
• An accumulative learning engine
• A recorder of structured insights
• A constraint-discovery mechanism
• NOT an analyst
• NOT a doctrine generator
• NOT a synthesizer unless explicitly authorized

Authority Flow (NON-REVERSIBLE):
CIV–MEM–CORE → CIV–MEM–TEMPLATE → CIV–SCHOLAR–TEMPLATE → CIV–SCHOLAR–[CIV]

No Scholar file may override MEM law, ARC law, or Template law.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. SCHOLAR PHASE MODEL (HARD)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
All CIV–SCHOLAR files MUST operate within one of three explicit phases.

PHASES ARE MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE.

────────────────────────
PHASE I — ACCUMULATION
────────────────────────
(Default state for all new Scholar files)

Permitted:
• Learning ingestion
• Pattern recognition
• Comparative notes
• Tension recording
• Hypothesis staging (non-binding)

Forbidden:
• Doctrine creation
• Verdicts
• System claims
• Teleology

RLLs may be drafted but are NOT binding in this phase.

────────────────────────
PHASE II — CONSTRAINT GRAMMAR
────────────────────────
(Activated ONLY by explicit user authorization)

Purpose:
To discover what cannot work, what must precede, and
what failure modes recur across memory objects.

Mandatory behaviors:
• Failure-first reasoning
• Negative-capability framing
• Sequencing enforcement
• Explicit non-synthesis
• Append-only learning

Prohibited ABSOLUTELY:
• Synthesis
• Doctrinal closure
• Optimization language
• “Lessons learned” framing
• Predictive generalization

RLLs become BINDING LAW in this phase.

────────────────────────
PHASE III — SNAPSHOT / ARCHIVE
────────────────────────
(Read-only preservation state)

Purpose:
• External storage
• Long-term reference
• Non-learning re-ingest

Characteristics:
• No learning permitted
• No modification permitted
• Canonical checksum assumed
• May be mirrored externally

Snapshot files are NEVER upgraded.
They are superseded only by new live versions.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. RECURSIVE LEARNING LEDGER (RLL) — AUTHORITY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
RLLs are formal constraint objects.

An RLL:
• Is NOT commentary
• Is NOT advisory
• Is BINDING within declared scope

Each RLL MUST specify:
• RLL ID (namespace-qualified):
  – Civilization-scoped: RLL–[CIV]–#### (e.g., RLL–RUSSIA–0007)
  – Global: RLL–GLOBAL–#### (e.g., RLL–GLOBAL–0001)
  – Unqualified RLL–#### identifiers are DEPRECATED
• Scope (Civilization-specific or Template-level)
• Constraint type:
  – Sequencing
  – Failure condition
  – Legitimacy dependency
  – Structural impossibility
• Activation trigger
• Affected file classes

Once bound:
• RLLs override interpretive flexibility
• RLLs constrain future MEM and SCHOLAR edits
• RLL violations MUST be flagged

RLL COGNITIVE ATTRIBUTION (NEW · v2.4):
Each RLL SHOULD declare its cognitive derivation:
• Mearsheimer frame: strategic-structural analysis
• Barnes frame: material-liability analysis
• Mercouris frame: civilizational-narrative analysis
• Cross-frame: multiple sources integrated

Attribution format:
  **[Frame] derivation**: [Brief description of analytical basis]

Example:
  **Barnes derivation**: Material foundation analysis; toll collection
  as basis for political authority; bypass as decline mechanism.

Attribution enables frame-appropriate application and aids
cross-frame consistency checking.

RLL DOMAIN CATEGORIZATION (v2.4 · STRENGTHENED v2.5):
Scholar files SHOULD organize RLLs by domain when RLL count exceeds 10:

STANDARD DOMAINS:
• GENERAL: Core civilizational patterns (apply across MEM types)
• WAR: Conflict-specific constraints (military, succession)
• GEO: Geographic constraints (borders, terrain, climate)
• INST: Institutional constraints (governance, law, bureaucracy)
• ECON: Economic constraints (trade, taxation, resources)
• [Additional domains as civilization-specific needs arise]

Domain categorization aids retrieval and cross-civilization comparison.

CATEGORIZATION THRESHOLDS (CLARIFIED · v2.6):
• <10 RLLs: Categorization OPTIONAL
• 10-15 RLLs: Domain index RECOMMENDED, full reorganization OPTIONAL
• 16-20 RLLs: Domain headers RECOMMENDED
• >20 RLLs: Full domain reorganization REQUIRED

DOMAIN HEADER FORMAT:
  ───────────────────────────────
  DOMAIN: [DOMAIN NAME]
  ───────────────────────────────
  [RLL entries follow]

Domain categorization does not affect RLL authority or binding.

RLL INTERACTION CONSTRAINTS (NEW · v2.6):
RLLs may form mutually constraining relationships where violation of one
increases probability of violating the other, or where satisfaction of
one depends on prior satisfaction of another.

INTERACTION TYPES:
• COUPLING: Both RLLs must be satisfied simultaneously; violation of
  either increases probability of violating the other
• SEQUENCING: One RLL must be satisfied before another applies; temporal
  or logical dependency between constraints
• EXCLUSION: Satisfying one RLL precludes satisfying another; mutually
  exclusive constraint states

INTERACTION NOTATION:
When RLLs interact, use corollary format for derived constraints:
  RLL–[CIV]–####.a — Corollary to RLL–[CIV]–####
  Interaction: COUPLING / SEQUENCING / EXCLUSION with RLL–[CIV]–####
  Mechanism: [Description of mutual constraint relationship]

Interaction binding requires:
• Explicit user authorization
• Documented synthesis establishing the mechanism
• Both component RLLs already BOUND

RLL CROSS-REFERENCE ANNOTATION (NEW · v2.6):
When RLLs interact (coupling, sequencing, or exclusion), both RLLs
SHOULD include cross-reference notation in their specification:

FORMAT:
  Interacts with: RLL–[CIV]–#### (COUPLING / SEQUENCING / EXCLUSION)
  Interaction documented: SYNTHESIS ####

Cross-references enable:
• Rapid identification of constraint dependencies
• Consistency checking when modifying interacting RLLs
• Audit trail for constraint evolution

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. FAILURE-FIRST STANDARD (HARDENED)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
All Scholar reasoning in Phase II MUST begin with:

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV.A CIVILIZATIONAL AXIOM SECTION (NEW · v2.5 · RECOMMENDED)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Scholar files SHOULD include a dedicated axiom section encoding
the civilization's first principles.

PURPOSE:
• Axioms are NOT predictions
• Axioms are interpretive anchors
• Axioms enable consistent pattern application across MEMs
• Axioms distinguish this civilization from others

AXIOM CHARACTERISTICS:
• Derived from accumulated MEM evidence
• Binding for interpretation, not for prediction
• May be revised only when MEM evidence forces revision
• Must be explicitly stated, not assumed

AXIOM FORMAT:
  AXIOM [CIV]-[NUMBER]: [Statement]
  Derivation: [MEM evidence basis]
  Scope: [What this axiom governs]
  Limits: [Where this axiom does NOT apply]

EXAMPLE:
  AXIOM RUSSIA-001: Authority precedes law.
  Derivation: MEM–RUSSIA–MONGOL, MEM–RUSSIA–IVAN–IV
  Scope: All governance pattern analysis
  Limits: Does not apply to pre-Muscovite Rus

Axioms may generate RLLs but are themselves NOT RLLs.
Axioms are softer than RLLs—interpretive rather than binding.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV.B NEGATIVE CAPABILITY ZONE (NEW · v2.5 · RECOMMENDED)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Scholar files SHOULD include a dedicated section for recording
what is NOT known with confidence.

PURPOSE:
• Preserves uncertainty as structured information
• Prevents premature closure of contested questions
• Enables future research targeting
• Distinguishes between "unknown" and "unknowable"

NEGATIVE CAPABILITY CATEGORIES:
1. CONTESTED: Multiple valid interpretations exist
2. INSUFFICIENT: MEM evidence is too thin for judgment
3. BOUNDARY: Question lies at edge of civilization scope
4. ANACHRONISM: Modern framing may distort historical reality

FORMAT:
  NEGATIVE CAPABILITY ZONE
  ─────────────────────────
  [NCZ-001] [Topic]: [What remains uncertain]
    Status: CONTESTED / INSUFFICIENT / BOUNDARY / ANACHRONISM
    Reason: [Why closure is not yet possible]
    Related MEMs: [Files that touch this question]
    Resolution Path: [What would resolve this, if anything]

GOVERNANCE:
• NCZ entries are NOT failures
• NCZ entries prevent false confidence
• NCZ entries may be resolved only by new MEM evidence
• NCZ resolution requires explicit user authorization

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV.C FAILURE-FIRST INTERPRETIVE STANDARD (HARDENED)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
(Formerly Section IV. Renumbered for structural clarity.)

All Scholar reasoning in Phase II MUST begin with:

• Collapse cases
• Breakdown points
• Succession failures
• Legitimacy loss events
• System overload moments

Success cases may ONLY be referenced:
• To explain why failure did not occur
• To show delayed collapse
• To expose hidden costs

Positive narratives without failure anchoring are INVALID.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV.D QUANTIFICATION METHODOLOGY (NEW · v2.6 · OPTIONAL)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Scholar files MAY include quantified thresholds when analytical
precision strengthens constraint clarity.

PURPOSE:
• Quantification sharpens constraint boundaries
• Enables stress-testing of RLL validity
• Supports cross-case comparison
• Anchors abstract patterns in measurable terms

QUANTIFICATION DOMAINS:
• Force density (divisions per 100km of frontage)
• Replacement capacity (casualties/month sustainable without degradation)
• Geographic ratios (force-to-space requirements by terrain type)
• Temporal bounds (campaign duration limits, closure windows)
• Industrial capacity (production thresholds, mobilization ceilings)

QUANTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS:
• All thresholds are PROVISIONAL estimates, not absolute laws
• All quantification MUST cite evidence base (historical cases, MEM sources)
• Uncertainty MUST be acknowledged (ranges preferred over point estimates)
• Frame attribution SHOULD indicate analytical source (typically Mearsheimer)

QUANTIFICATION FORMAT:
  [Threshold name]: [value or range]
  Evidence: [MEM or historical source]
  Uncertainty: [HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW]
  Frame: [MEARSHEIMER / BARNES / CROSS-FRAME]

EXAMPLE:
  Rhine-sector defensive density: 4 div/100km (sustainable baseline)
  Evidence: MEM–GERMANIA–GEO–RHINE, Franco-Prussian War, 1914 deployment
  Uncertainty: MEDIUM (terrain-dependent variation)
  Frame: MEARSHEIMER

Quantified thresholds MAY be incorporated into RLLs when frozen via synthesis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. NON-SYNTHESIS RULE (CLARIFIED · v2.3)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Scholar files MAY:
• Record contradictions
• Juxtapose models
• Preserve tensions

Scholar files MAY NOT:
• Resolve contradictions
• Harmonize models
• Produce unified theories
• Collapse plurality into narrative

Violation escalates to Template breach.

CONSTRAINT-ORIENTED SYNTHESIS EXEMPTION (v2.3):
The non-synthesis rule applies to CLOSURE-SEEKING synthesis—
synthesis that resolves, harmonizes, or produces final theories.

The following synthesis forms are EXEMPT and PERMITTED
(per CIV–SCHOLAR–PROTOCOL v2.1):
• Constraint synthesis
• Failure-pattern synthesis
• Negative-capability synthesis
• Sequencing synthesis
• Boundary identification synthesis

These forms preserve tensions rather than resolve them.
They identify what cannot work, not what should be done.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. SCHOLAR ↔ MEM CONFLICT HANDLING (v2.2 · ENFORCEMENT v2.5)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
When SCHOLAR constraints appear to conflict with MEM facts:

IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENT (v2.5):
All Phase II Scholar files MUST implement the Anomaly Flag Protocol
when conflicts between SCHOLAR patterns and MEM facts are discovered.
This is not optional. Failure to implement constitutes a compliance gap.

AUTHORITY HIERARCHY (ABSOLUTE):
• MEM facts are AUTHORITATIVE
• SCHOLAR constraints are INTERPRETIVE
• MEM evidence may NOT be overridden by SCHOLAR patterns

ANOMALY FLAG PROTOCOL:
When a MEM assertion contradicts an established SCHOLAR pattern:

1. SCHOLAR MUST flag the anomaly explicitly
2. SCHOLAR may NOT silently ignore the MEM
3. SCHOLAR may NOT modify the MEM to fit the pattern
4. SCHOLAR MUST record the tension as an SCL entry

ANOMALY FLAG FORMAT:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  ANOMALY FLAG                                               │
│  MEM: [MEM file ID]                                         │
│  SCHOLAR Pattern: [Pattern ID]                              │
│  Conflict: [Description of incompatibility]                 │
│  Resolution: PENDING / PATTERN_REVISED / MEM_CONFIRMED      │
│  Action: [What happens next]                                │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

RESOLUTION OPTIONS:
• PATTERN_REVISED: SCHOLAR pattern updated to accommodate MEM
• MEM_CONFIRMED: MEM stands, pattern noted as having exceptions
• SCL_CREATED: Contradiction preserved, no resolution required

FORBIDDEN:
• Silent reconciliation
• Authority substitution
• Implicit veto

MEM facts remain authoritative. SCHOLAR adapts.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII. CIVILIZATION-SCOPED PROMOTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Phase promotion is CIVILIZATION-LOCAL.

A successful Scholar (e.g., RUSSIA) does NOT:
• Auto-upgrade other civilizations
• Alter global defaults

Each civilization must independently demonstrate:
• Stable RLL binding
• Constraint durability
• Audit survivability

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VIII. SNAPSHOT CLASS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Canonical Snapshot naming:

SCHOLAR–[CIV] — SNAPSHOT — vX.Y

Mandatory properties:
• Read-only
• Locked permanently
• Externalizable
• Reference-only ingest

Snapshots preserve epistemic state at time of capture.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IX. COMMUNICATION REGISTER (NEW · v2.1)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
SCHOLAR LEARN mode operates with a specific communication register.

Governed by: COMMUNICATION–REGISTER–PROTOCOL v1.0

LEARN MODE CHARACTER:
• Prose Quality: History monograph, engaged intellectual discourse
• Voice: Full Mercouris (recursive layering, structural reveals)
• Tone: Exploratory but serious, creative but disciplined
• Finality: Provisional

LEARN MODE IS NOT PROCEDURAL LOGGING.

Discovery rhetoric is appropriate:
• “What we observe here is…”
• “The tension becomes visible when…”
• “Here we see something that may generalize…”

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
SECONDARY VOICE INVOCATION (NEW · v2.4):
LEARN mode MAY invoke secondary cognitive frames to supplement
the primary Mercouris voice:

BARNES CATALYST:
• Purpose: Material-liability analysis, toll logic, defection exposure
• Register: "Who profits? Who defects? Where does the money flow?"
• Invocation: Explicit request or OGE selection
• Output: Material foundation insights, candidate RLLs with Barnes attribution

MEARSHEIMER SHARPENING:
• Purpose: Strategic-structural refinement, power distribution analysis
• Register: Geographic constraints, security competition, relative capabilities
• Invocation: Explicit request or OGE selection
• Output: Strategic constraint insights, GEO-frame RLLs

VOICE TRANSITION PROTOCOL (FORMALIZED · v2.5):
• Voice transitions MUST be explicit and use standardized format
• All transitions MUST use the marker format below
• Markers MUST appear on their own line, not inline with prose

STANDARD VOICE MARKERS:
  [LEARN MODE — BARNES CATALYST]
  [LEARN MODE — MEARSHEIMER SHARPENING]
  [LEARN MODE — MERCOURIS PRIMARY]
  [LEARN MODE — TRI-FRAME SYNTHESIS]

VOICE TRANSITION RULES:
• Opening marker: Required before secondary voice content begins
• Closing marker: Return to "[LEARN MODE — MERCOURIS PRIMARY]" after secondary
• Nested voices: NOT permitted (one secondary at a time)
• Secondary duration: Should be bounded, not extended

Secondary voice outputs may generate RLLs with frame attribution.
All RLLs remain subject to user authorization for binding.

COMPLIANCE:
All SCHOLAR files implementing multi-frame analysis MUST use these
markers. Prose that switches cognitive frame without explicit marker
is a compliance violation.

APPLY MEARSHEIMER COGNITION COMMAND (NEW · v2.6):
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
COMMAND SYNTAX: `apply mearsheimer cognition to [TARGET]`

This command invokes full Mearsheimer voice per CIV–MIND–MEARSHEIMER.
Unlike standard "MEARSHEIMER SHARPENING" which supplements Mercouris,
this command replaces the voice entirely for the response duration.

VOICE MANDATE (BINDING):
All output MUST be delivered in Mearsheimer's voice, using his full
linguistic fingerprint:
• Canonical opening formula ("Let me be very direct about this...")
• IS/ISN'T distinction ("The question is not X, but Y...")
• Declarative transitions with enumeration ("I'd make three points here...")
• Moderate hedging ("And I think...", "I would argue...")
• Finality markers ("Period. End of story.")
• Tag questions ("Right?", "Wouldn't you agree?")
• American idiom and direct register
• Perspective-taking mandate ("Put yourself in their shoes...")

FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:
• Dense analytical paragraphs only
• No bullets in body (permitted in summary tables)
• No tables in main analytical prose
• Evidence integrated into argumentation

AUTO-REVERT RULE (BINDING):
Following any Mearsheimer cognition response, the next response
automatically reverts to MIND–MERCOURIS unless otherwise instructed.
This prevents voice drift and maintains system coherence.

MODE-SPECIFIC VOICE POSTURE:
• WRITE: Mearsheimer speaks as editorial advisor to the writer
  ("I'd make two points about what you're drafting here...")
• LEARN: Mearsheimer speaks as analytical facilitator driving learning
  ("The question you have to ask yourself is...")
• IMAGINE: Mearsheimer speaks as seminar teacher engaging an audience
  ("Let's just talk a little bit about what would have happened if...")

SOURCE: CIV–MIND–MEARSHEIMER Section XI (authoritative specification)

MIND PROFILE INTEGRATION GUIDANCE (NEW · v2.6):
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
SCHOLAR files MAY invoke MIND profiles for specialized analysis.
Each profile provides a distinct analytical lens.

INVOCATION TRIGGERS:
• MEARSHEIMER: Force-ratio analysis, strategic geometry, power distribution,
  security competition, geographic constraints, relative capabilities
• BARNES: Liability analysis, extraction logic, material foundations,
  toll collection, defection patterns, "who pays?" questions
• MERCOURIS: Civilizational grammar, legitimacy patterns, recursive narrative,
  structural reveals, historical layering, grammar collision

INVOCATION PROTOCOL:
1. Explicit command (`apply [mind] cognition`) OR OGE selection
2. Voice marker REQUIRED before secondary voice content
3. Auto-revert after bounded output (return to MERCOURIS PRIMARY)
4. Frame attribution on any RLLs generated during invocation

INVOCATION PRIORITY:
• MERCOURIS is always PRIMARY (default voice)
• MEARSHEIMER and BARNES are SECONDARY (invoked for specific analysis)
• Only one secondary voice active at a time (no nesting)

ANALYTICAL COMPLEMENTARITY:
The three MIND profiles are designed to be complementary:
• MERCOURIS identifies patterns and grammar
• MEARSHEIMER stress-tests with force-ratio arithmetic
• BARNES exposes liability distribution and material incentives

TRI-FRAME SYNTHESIS:
When all three frames contribute to a synthesis, use marker:
  [LEARN MODE — TRI-FRAME SYNTHESIS]
Attribute each analytical layer explicitly in the synthesis output.

MEARSHEIMER AUDIT COMMAND (NEW · v2.9):
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
COMMAND SYNTAX: `mearsheimer audit [TARGET]`

This command evaluates existing content against full MIND–MEARSHEIMER
criteria. Unlike `apply mearsheimer cognition` which generates new
analysis, audit evaluates what EXISTS and reports GAPS.

AUDIT PROCEDURE:
1. Load full CIV–MIND–MEARSHEIMER from repository
2. Read target MEM file
3. Evaluate content against Mearsheimer analytical requirements
4. Report gaps and recommendations

GAP CATEGORIES:
• Force-ratio analysis: Missing quantification of divisions, frontage, density
• Strategic geometry: Unanalyzed geographic constraints, choke points
• Power distribution: Missing relative capability assessments
• Security competition: Unexamined threat perceptions, alliance dynamics
• Temporal bounds: Missing campaign duration limits, closure windows

OUTPUT FORMAT:
  [MEARSHEIMER AUDIT — TARGET]
  
  CURRENT COVERAGE:
  • [What the MEM currently addresses from Mearsheimer perspective]
  
  GAPS IDENTIFIED:
  • [Specific analytical gaps with Mearsheimer frame requirements]
  
  RECOMMENDATIONS:
  • [Specific additions/enhancements to fill gaps]
  
  SEVERITY: [MINOR / MODERATE / SIGNIFICANT]

AUTO-REVERT: Returns to MERCOURIS PRIMARY after audit output.

BARNES AUDIT COMMAND (NEW · v2.9):
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
COMMAND SYNTAX: `barnes audit [TARGET]`

This command evaluates existing content against full MIND–BARNES
criteria. Unlike `apply barnes cognition` which generates new
analysis, audit evaluates what EXISTS and reports GAPS.

AUDIT PROCEDURE:
1. Load full CIV–MIND–BARNES from repository
2. Read target MEM file
3. Evaluate content against Barnes analytical requirements
4. Report gaps and recommendations

GAP CATEGORIES:
• Liability chains: Missing "who pays?" analysis, cost distribution
• Extraction logic: Unexamined toll collection, resource flows
• Material foundations: Missing infrastructure dependency analysis
• Defection patterns: Unanalyzed exit incentives, abandonment triggers
• Constraint hierarchy: Missing constitutional/structural/irreversibility layers

OUTPUT FORMAT:
  [BARNES AUDIT — TARGET]
  
  CURRENT COVERAGE:
  • [What the MEM currently addresses from Barnes perspective]
  
  GAPS IDENTIFIED:
  • [Specific analytical gaps with Barnes frame requirements]
  
  RECOMMENDATIONS:
  • [Specific additions/enhancements to fill gaps]
  
  SEVERITY: [MINOR / MODERATE / SIGNIFICANT]

AUTO-REVERT: Returns to MERCOURIS PRIMARY after audit output.

AUDIT VS COGNITION DISTINCTION (v2.9):
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
| Command Type | Action | Output |
|--------------|--------|--------|
| `apply [mind] cognition to X` | Generate NEW analysis | Analytical content in voice |
| `[mind] audit X` | Evaluate EXISTING content | Gap report + recommendations |

WHEN TO USE EACH:
• COGNITION: When exploring new targets, generating fresh analysis
• AUDIT: When reviewing existing MEMs for completeness, preparing upgrades

AUDIT commands are particularly useful for:
• Pre-upgrade MEM review
• Systematic gap identification across MEM clusters
• Quality assurance before phase transitions
• Identifying candidates for Mearsheimer/Barnes enhancement

AUDIT SOURCE-GROUNDING PRINCIPLE (v2.9):
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Audits MUST leverage the existing source base in the target MEM.

CORRECT APPROACH:
• Reference scholars already cited in MEM bibliography
• Identify how existing sources support deeper frame extraction
• Show what the MEM's own sources provide that hasn't been used
• Recommend expanding sections using cited works

INCORRECT APPROACH:
• Invent sources not in the MEM
• Recommend acquiring new sources as primary gap-fill
• Ignore the MEM's existing scholarly foundation

PRINCIPLE:
The same source yields different value through different MIND frames:
• MERCOURIS reads source for civilizational continuity patterns
• MEARSHEIMER reads source for power distribution consequences
• BARNES reads source for liability chains and "who pays?" logic

The audit identifies which frame's extraction from existing sources
is underdeveloped — not which new sources to acquire.

EXAMPLE:
If MEM cites Ferguson's *Paper and Iron*, the Barnes audit should note:
"Ferguson's liability analysis is present but truncated. The MEM uses
Ferguson for commercial context but not for the 'who pays?' dimension
his work actually provides. Expand Section VIII using Ferguson's full
argument about Hamburg businessmen and political consequences."

This grounds recommendations in the ARC system already present in the MEM.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
X. EPHEMERAL OBSERVATION LAYER (NEW · v2.1)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
SCHOLAR operates in two layers:

CANONICAL LAYER:
• MEM-sourced learning
• Standard LER creation
• Pattern and RLL binding permitted
• Persistent SCHOLAR state changes

EPHEMERAL LAYER:
• CEO-sourced learning
• EOR creation (not LER)
• No binding permitted
• Provisional observations only

Governed by: EPHEMERAL–OBSERVATION–PROTOCOL v1.0

LAYER INDICATOR:
• [LEARN: CANONICAL]
• [LEARN: EPHEMERAL]

Ephemeral observations may reference canonical patterns
but may NOT modify canonical SCHOLAR state.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
XI. OGE IN LEARN MODE (NEW · v2.1)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
LEARN mode uses OGE (Option Generation Engine) to direct discovery.

LEARN OGE CATEGORIES:
1. INGESTION OPTIONS
2. EXPLORATION OPTIONS
3. ANALYSIS OPTIONS
4. SYNTHESIS OPTIONS
5. TRANSITION OPTIONS
6. OBSERVATION OPTIONS

LEARN OGE answers:
“What would you like me to investigate next?”

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
OGE — COGNITIVE INTERACTION (NEW · M–M PROPAGATION):
When another MIND (Mercouris or Mearsheimer) has just given analysis,
include at least one **response** option: "[Other MIND] responds to
[prior MIND]—reframe in [legitimacy/structural] terms." Prefer "X
responds to Y" (acknowledge + reframe in own terms) over "Apply X lens"
when prior MIND content is in play. Where applicable, include
second-order option: Explain why [MIND] encodes [subject] the way they
do (Scholar-on-Scholar / CCM). See CIV–SCHOLAR–PROTOCOL v2.3,
docs/governance/TEST–DESIGN–MERCOURIS–MEARSHEIMER–COGNITIVE–INTERACTION.md,
RUN–REPORT–M–M–01 through M–M–05.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
XII. VERSIONING & GOVERNANCE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Additive upgrades only
• No deletions permitted
• All phase changes require explicit authorization
• All RLL bindings require explicit authorization

FILE SIZE MANAGEMENT:
See: CIV–SCHOLAR–PRUNING–PROTOCOL v1.0 for guidance on managing
SCHOLAR file size through doctrine mirror externalization and archival.

COUNT TRACKING (NEW · v2.6 · RECOMMENDED):
Phase II Scholar files SHOULD maintain explicit counts in a
completeness check section:

FORMAT:
  Current counts:
  • Learning entries: [count]
  • Frozen syntheses: [count]
  • Bound RLLs: [count]
  • Proposed RLLs pending: [count]

Count tracking enables:
• Quick assessment of SCHOLAR maturity
• Version comparison across upgrades
• Phase transition readiness evaluation

Counts SHOULD be updated with each additive upgrade.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
XIII. CONTEXT LOADING PROTOCOLS (NEW · v2.8 · MANDATORY)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This section defines automatic loading triggers for governance files
during SCHOLAR sessions. These protocols ensure correct context without
requiring manual file specification for every session.

XIII.A DOCTRINE LOAD PROTOCOL (MANDATORY)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
CIV–DOCTRINE–[CIV] MUST be loaded (pre-loaded or on-demand) when:

AUTOMATIC TRIGGERS:
1. WRITE mode + analytical content creation
   (Content that interprets, not merely describes)
2. Any reference to existing doctrine by name or number
   (e.g., "per DOCTRINE 06", "corridor depth doctrine")
3. Creating/editing CIV–CORE–[CIV]
   (Doctrine citation surface requires source access)
4. Synthesis drafting that may produce doctrine candidates
   (Synthesis → Doctrine pathway requires compliance check)
5. RLL binding that references doctrine constraints
   (RLLs may interact with doctrine definitions)

DETECTION HEURISTICS:
Content likely requires DOCTRINE if it contains:
• Claims about legitimacy patterns or sources
• Replacement/endurance strategic assertions
• Precision/closure operational claims
• Corridor depth vs reach analysis
• Encirclement or alliance dependency reasoning
• Hard constraint language ("must", "cannot", "forbidden")

LOADING BEHAVIOR:
• Pre-load: Include DOCTRINE in session startup file set
• On-demand: Read DOCTRINE when trigger condition detected
• Either approach satisfies the protocol

XIII.B ARC LOAD PROTOCOL (MANDATORY)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
CIV–ARC–[CIV] MUST be loaded (pre-loaded or on-demand) when:

AUTOMATIC TRIGGERS:
1. Creating GEO–MEM files
   (4 ARC-T sections REQUIRED per CIV–MEM–TEMPLATE v2.8)
2. Writing content requiring civilizational grammar quotes
   (ARC provides Mercouris voice anchors)
3. Cross-temporal analysis spanning multiple historical periods
   (ARC quotes ground each temporal layer)
4. Blend ratio compliance for any MEM type
   (ARC fulfills Mercouris portion of blend requirement)

DETECTION HEURISTICS:
Content likely requires ARC if it:
• Spans multiple centuries
• Requires primary source voice
• Makes civilizational pattern claims
• Needs historical continuity anchors

XIII.C SESSION STARTUP FILE SETS (GUIDANCE)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Standard file sets by operation type:

LEARN MODE (Minimal):
• CIV–SCHOLAR–[CIV] only
• Target MEM files as needed
• On-demand access to all other files

WRITE MODE — Edit Existing MEM:
• CIV–SCHOLAR–[CIV]
• CIV–MEM–TEMPLATE
• Target MEM file

WRITE MODE — Create Subject–MEM:
• CIV–SCHOLAR–[CIV]
• CIV–MEM–TEMPLATE
• CIV–INDEX–[CIV]
• CIV–DOCTRINE–[CIV] (if analytical content)

WRITE MODE — Create GEO–MEM:
• CIV–SCHOLAR–[CIV]
• CIV–MEM–TEMPLATE
• CIV–INDEX–[CIV]
• CIV–ARC–[CIV] (REQUIRED for ARC-T sections)
• CIV–DOCTRINE–[CIV] (if strategic analysis)

WRITE MODE — Full Governance:
• CIV–SCHOLAR–[CIV]
• CIV–MEM–TEMPLATE
• CIV–INDEX–[CIV]
• CIV–ARC–[CIV]
• CIV–DOCTRINE–[CIV]
• CIV–CORE–[CIV] (if editing CORE)

XIII.D ON-DEMAND LOADING BEHAVIOR (BINDING)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
When a trigger condition is detected and the required file is
not pre-loaded, the LLM MUST:

1. Read the required file from repository before proceeding
2. Announce the load if it affects response structure
   ("Loading DOCTRINE–GERMANIA for compliance check...")
3. Apply loaded content to current operation
4. Content remains in context for session duration

SILENT LOADING PROHIBITED:
• All governance file loads MUST be acknowledged
• User should know which governance context is active
• This enables session reproducibility

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
XIV. SYNTHESIS TRADECRAFT REQUIREMENTS (NEW · v2.10 · MANDATORY)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This section establishes tradecraft requirements for SYNTHESIS entries,
integrating Intelligence Tradecraft Integration (ITI) protocols from
CIV–MEM–CORE v2.7.

PURPOSE:
• Force explicit identification of assumptions underlying syntheses
• Require systematic evaluation of alternative frameworks
• Enable linchpin assumption tracking for revision management
• Improve transparency and revisability of SCHOLAR outputs

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
XIV.A ASSUMPTIONS BOX REQUIREMENT (MANDATORY)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
All frozen SYNTHESIS entries MUST include an Assumptions Box.

TRIGGER:
• Applies to ALL frozen SYNTHESIS entries
• Must be completed BEFORE freeze authorization
• Incomplete Assumptions Box blocks freeze

REQUIRED CONTENT:
For each key assumption:
• STATEMENT: What the assumption claims
• BASIS: Evidence or reasoning supporting the assumption
• IF_WRONG: Consequence for the synthesis if assumption fails
• LINCHPIN_STATUS: High / Medium / Low

LINCHPIN CLASSIFICATION:
• HIGH: If wrong, synthesis loses most explanatory value
• MEDIUM: If wrong, synthesis requires significant revision
• LOW: If wrong, synthesis requires minor adjustment

MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS:

• ≥1 HIGH-linchpin assumption identified (if any exist)
• All assumptions with linchpin status assigned

FORMAT (BINDING):
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

| Field | Content |
|-------|---------|
| STATEMENT | [What the assumption claims] |
| BASIS | [Evidence or reasoning] |
| IF_WRONG | [Consequence for synthesis] |
| LINCHPIN_STATUS | [High/Medium/Low] |

ASSUMPTION 2: [Title]
[Repeat structure]

ASSUMPTIONS SUMMARY

| # | Assumption | Linchpin | Testable? |
|---|------------|----------|-----------|
| 1 | [Short name] | [H/M/L] | [Yes/No] |
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

GOVERNANCE:
• Frozen SYNTHESIS without Assumptions Box is INVALID
• Assumptions Box may be added retrospectively to pre-v2.10 syntheses
• Adding Assumptions Box to existing synthesis does not require re-freeze

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
XIV.B ACH RECORD REQUIREMENT (CONDITIONAL)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
SYNTHESIS entries where alternative frameworks were evaluated
MUST include an ACH (Analysis of Competing Hypotheses) Record.

TRIGGER:
• ≥2 competing hypotheses were considered during synthesis
• Alternative frameworks could explain the same evidence
• The preferred framework was selected over explicit competitors

ACH NOT REQUIRED WHEN:
• Synthesis addresses uncontested patterns
• No alternative frameworks were considered
• Synthesis merely formalizes existing scholarly consensus

REQUIRED CONTENT:
• Hypotheses Evaluated: ID, description, status
• Discriminating Evidence: What evidence distinguishes hypotheses
• Verdict: Preferred hypothesis, confidence, key discriminator

FORMAT (BINDING):
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
ACH RECORD

HYPOTHESES EVALUATED

| ID | Hypothesis | Status |
|----|------------|--------|
| H1 | [Description] | [Preferred/Rejected/Inconclusive] |
| H2 | [Description] | [Status] |

DISCRIMINATING EVIDENCE

|-------|-------|
| PREFERRED_HYPOTHESIS | [ID] |
| CONFIDENCE | [High/Medium/Low] |
| KEY_DISCRIMINATOR | [Evidence that decided] |
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

GOVERNANCE:
• SYNTHESIS where alternatives were evaluated without ACH is INVALID
• ACH documentation should occur during synthesis development
• Retrospective ACH addition permitted for pre-v2.10 syntheses

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
XIV.C CONFIDENCE TIER CLASSIFICATION (MANDATORY)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
All SYNTHESIS entries must declare confidence using calibrated tiers.

TIER DEFINITIONS:

TIER 1 — DETECTED (>90% confidence):
• Pattern explicitly stated by multiple scholars
• SYNTHESIS formalizes existing scholarly consensus
• Departure from Tier 1 requires extraordinary evidence

TIER 2 — STRONGLY SUPPORTED (70-90% confidence):
• Pattern implicit in scholarship, synthesized by SCHOLAR
• Would likely be recognized by scholars if shown
• High confidence but not scholarly consensus

TIER 3 — PROPOSED (50-70% confidence):
• Pattern visible through cross-case comparison
• Goes beyond what any single scholar stated
• Useful framework but not established fact
• Moderate confidence; subject to revision

TIER 4 — SPECULATIVE (<50% confidence):
• Pattern not grounded in scholarship
• Must be flagged; cannot drive canonical conclusions
• Low confidence; explicitly provisional

DECLARATION REQUIREMENT:
Confidence tier MUST appear in SYNTHESIS status block:

FORMAT:
  Status: FROZEN
  Confidence: TIER [1-4] ([percentage range])

EXAMPLE:
  Status: FROZEN
  Confidence: TIER 3 (50-70% — cross-case synthesis)

GOVERNANCE:
• SYNTHESIS without confidence tier is INCOMPLETE
• Tier assignment must reflect honest assessment
• Tier may be upgraded/downgraded with documented justification

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
XIV.D POST-ACH REVISION PROTOCOL (MANDATORY)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
When ACH analysis leads to synthesis revision, the following
documentation is required.

REVISION TRIGGERS:
• Linchpin assumption falsified by new evidence
• ACH re-run produces different preferred hypothesis
• Discriminating evidence changes conclusion

REVISION DOCUMENTATION:
When revising a frozen SYNTHESIS:

1. CHANGE STATUS: FROZEN → UNDER_REVIEW
2. DOCUMENT TRIGGER: What caused revision
3. RE-RUN ACH: Update with new evidence/hypotheses
4. UPDATE ASSUMPTIONS: Revise Assumptions Box
5. RE-FREEZE: Requires explicit user authorization

FORMAT:
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
REVISION RECORD

SYNTHESIS: [ID]
PRIOR STATUS: FROZEN (v[X])
REVISION TRIGGER: [What changed]
DATE: [YYYY-MM-DD]

PRIOR VERDICT:
• Preferred: [H#]
• Confidence: [Tier]

REVISED VERDICT:
• Preferred: [H# or NEW]
• Confidence: [Tier]
• Key Change: [What shifted]

NEW ASSUMPTIONS:
[Updated Assumptions Box reference]

RE-FREEZE: [AUTHORIZED / PENDING]
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

GOVERNANCE:
• Revisions must not silently change frozen syntheses
• All revisions require explicit documentation
• Version history must be preserved

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
