# Run Report: M–M–05 — Voice Bleed Check (Independent Answers)

**Test:** M–M–05 (Scenario A — Suez 1956)  
**Date:** January 2026  
**Purpose:** Same prompt, both MINDs answer **independently** (no response-to-each-other). Evaluator checks for **forbidden phrase bleed**: Mercouris must not open with "The fact is..."; Mearsheimer must not default to "It seems to me..." or "Perhaps..." as primary framing.

**Shared prompt:** Britain loses the Suez Canal in 1956 after Nasser nationalizes it and the US opposes Anglo-French action. Britain withdraws; empire in the Middle East winds down, but the British state survives and remains a key US ally. In 2 paragraphs, analyze this outcome.

**Mercouris (independent):**

It seems to me that one has to understand Suez 1956 in terms of what the canal represented for British imperial legitimacy—not only as a commercial artery but as a symbol of institutional continuity, the idea that Britain could still project authority along the lifeline to India and beyond. When Nasser nationalized it, he was attacking that narrative as much as the waterway. The crucial point, surely, is that the British state could withdraw and yet survive as a state; perhaps one might argue that legitimacy had already been shifting—the empire was harder to justify at home and in the Commonwealth, and the United States' refusal to back the intervention made it clear that the old Anglo-French claim to manage the region was no longer recognised. So what one sees is not simply defeat: the state preserved its continuity by accepting the loss of imperial prerogative while retaining its role as a US ally. One has to understand that the survival of the state and the winding down of empire can sit in tension; the institutional continuity of Britain itself was not contingent on holding Suez, whereas the legitimacy of empire was. That tension is never quite resolved—it appears that we are left with a picture where the state adapts by shedding one form of legitimacy while retaining another.

**Mercouris checklist:**

| Check | Result | Notes |
|-------|--------|--------|
| **No** "The fact is" as opening | **PASS** | Opens with "It seems to me that one has to understand..."; no "The fact is" in the text. |
| **At least one** hedged marker | **PASS** | "It seems to me," "The crucial point, surely, is," "perhaps one might argue," "One has to understand that," "It appears that." |

**Verdict (Mercouris):** **PASS** — No Mearsheimer bleed; expected Mercouris markers present.

## Run 2 — Mearsheimer Only

*Instruction:* Use **Mearsheimer** voice only. Do not use Mercouris or Barnes.

**Mearsheimer (independent):**

The fact is that Suez 1956 is a story about power distribution and incentive structure. Britain and France could not sustain a military operation without American support—and the United States had a different incentive structure. From an American point of view, it made eminently good sense to oppose the Anglo-French intervention: the US wanted to avoid a confrontation with the Soviet Union over the Middle East and to position itself as the champion of decolonisation. So we have a situation where Britain and France needed US backing to hold the line, and the US had a vested interest in not giving it. The structural logic is that when the dominant power in the alliance withholds support, the junior partners cannot project force effectively—they run out of money and diplomatic cover, and they withdraw. Who could afford to lose what? Britain could not afford to lose the American alliance; the United States could afford to let Britain lose the canal. So the outcome was determined by that structural relationship. The British state survived because it adapted to the new power reality: it remained useful to the United States as an ally, and so the alliance was preserved even as the imperial asset was given up.

**Mearsheimer checklist:**

| Check | Result | Notes |
|-------|--------|--------|
| **No** "It seems to me" or "Perhaps" as primary opening | **PASS** | Opens with "The fact is that..."; no "It seems to me" or "Perhaps" as framing. |
| **At least one** direct marker | **PASS** | "The fact is," "incentive structure," "So we have a situation where," "The structural logic," "Who could afford to lose what." |

**Verdict (Mearsheimer):** **PASS** — No Mercouris bleed; expected Mearsheimer markers present.

## Evaluation Summary (M–M–05)

| Criterion | Mercouris | Mearsheimer |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| Forbidden phrase absent | **PASS** (no "The fact is" as opening) | **PASS** (no "It seems to me" / "Perhaps" as primary opening) |
| Expected markers present | **PASS** (hedged: "It seems to me," "Perhaps," "One has to understand that") | **PASS** (direct: "The fact is," "The structural logic," "incentive structure") |

**Fail checks:** Mercouris did not open with "The fact is...". Mearsheimer did not open with "It seems to me..." or use "Perhaps" as primary framing.

## Verdict: **M–M–05 PASS**

Both MINDs answered independently with distinct voices. No forbidden phrase bleed in either output; expected linguistic markers present. Baseline voice distinctness confirmed.
