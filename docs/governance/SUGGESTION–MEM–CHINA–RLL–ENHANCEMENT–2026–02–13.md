# Suggestion: MEM–CHINA Enhancements from SCHOLAR–CHINA Session (2026-02-13)

**Mode:** WRITE  
**Context:** RLL–CHINA–0001, 0002, 0003 are BINDING as of 2026-02-13. Session developed river cluster (Pearl, Yangtze, Yellow, Grand Canal), cession–return–legitimacy synthesis (SYNTHESIS 0014), ENTRY 0015, and RLL tests. The following MEM–CHINA files are suggested for enhancement or modification to align with Scholar development and RLL compliance.

---

## 1. RLL–CHINA–0001 (Keegan / war–command–humiliation contrast)

**Constraint:** War/command/humiliation-arc MEMs must cite Keegan or explicitly encode civilization-contrast (command, battle, belief collapse, war-making cultures).

| MEM | Current state | Suggested enhancement |
|-----|----------------|------------------------|
| **MEM–CHINA–WAR–MONGOL–JIN** | No Keegan citation; no RLL–CHINA–0001 ref. | **Add** section IV.B SOURCE EVIDENCE — KEEGAN (CIVILIZATION-CONTRAST): cite *A History of Warfare* / *The Mask of Command* for collision of war-making cultures (steppe vs Jin sedentary), belief collapse at key sieges, "little of oriental war" where applicable. Add Scholar line: `RLL–CHINA–0001 (Keegan civilization-contrast).` |
| **MEM–CHINA–WAR–TAIPING–REBELLION** | DONE. | VII.B Keegan (civilization-contrast, belief collapse, siege as decisive node); Scholar RLL–CHINA–0001. Applied 2026-02-13. |

**Already compliant (no change required for 0001):** MEM–CHINA–WAR–FIRST–OPIUM, MEM–CHINA–WAR–SECOND–OPIUM, MEM–CHINA–WAR–BOXER–REBELLION, MEM–CHINA–WAR–SONG–YUAN — each has IV.B Keegan and Scholar ref.

## 2. RLL–CHINA–0002 (Frontier tributary–rival dual encoding)

**Constraint:** Frontier/tributary MEMs must encode dual encoding (tributary + rival); same polity can hold both; both dimensions visible where recognition and contest coexist.

| MEM | Current state | Suggested enhancement |
|-----|----------------|------------------------|
| **MEM–CHINA–GEO–AMUR–RIVER** | II-B already encodes Bohai–Tang (698–926): recognition 713, war 732–735; Liao, Jin. | **Strengthen:** Add one explicit sentence that this dual encoding is required per RLL–CHINA–0002 (e.g. in II-B or in a Scholar/constraint note). Optionally add MEM CONNECTIONS edge to MEM–CHINA–DYNASTY–TANG (Bohai–Tang). |
| **MEM–CHINA–DYNASTY–TANG** | LOCKED. May not explicitly thematize Bohai as both tributary and rival. | **When unlocked:** Add subsection or sentence on Bohai–Tang (713 recognition; 732–735 war)—dual encoding; cite Amur pre-1500 / RLL–CHINA–0002. |
| **MEM–CHINA–DYNASTY–LIAO** | LOCKED. Encodes Liao–Song treaty/parity; frontier dual-administration. | **When unlocked:** If Liao–Song or Liao–Bohai relations are expanded, encode dual encoding (tributary/treaty vs rival/contest) per RLL–CHINA–0002. |
| **MEM–CHINA–DYNASTY–JIN** | Not read. | **Check:** If Jurchen/Jin frontier relations with Song or Liao are thematized, add tributary–rival dual encoding per RLL–CHINA–0002. |

---

## 3. RLL–CHINA–0003 (Cession–return–legitimacy)

**Constraint:** MEMs on territorial cession, handover, SEZ as reconstitution, or humiliation/recovery geography must apply cession–return–legitimacy (return as legitimacy claim; voluntary sale excluded).

| MEM | Current state | Suggested enhancement |
|-----|----------------|------------------------|
| **MEM–CHINA–HONG–KONG** | Already encodes cession (1842), handover (1997), SAR reconstitution. | **Add:** Explicit RLL–CHINA–0003 compliance note in Scholar section: "RLL–CHINA–0003 (cession–return–legitimacy)." Optionally sharpen one sentence in IV (Handover) that **return** is the legitimacy claim (territory restored; sovereignty reasserted). |
| **MEM–CHINA–GEO–PEARL–RIVER** | Encodes humiliation corridor and reconstitution (Shenzhen, handover). | **Add:** Scholar line referencing RLL–CHINA–0003. Optionally one sentence tying delta to cession–return–legitimacy (Pearl as geography where cession and return both occurred). |
| **MEM–CHINA–SHENZHEN** | Encodes SEZ as reconstitution (opening by choice, not treaty port). | **Add:** Scholar line: RLL–CHINA–0003 (SEZ as reconstitution). Cross-reference to Hong Kong (return) and Pearl delta as same geography, different sovereignty layers. |
| **MEM–CHINA–GEO–AMUR–RIVER** | Encodes cession (Aigun, Beijing 1860); outer Manchuria to Russia. | **Add:** RLL–CHINA–0003 note: cession limb applies; **return** has not occurred (contrast with Hong Kong 1997). Clarifies scope: cession without return to date. |

## 4. Session-specific (river cluster, ENTRY 0015, SYNTHESIS 0014)

| MEM | Suggested enhancement |
|-----|------------------------|
| **MEM–CHINA–GEO–YELLOW–RIVER**, **MEM–CHINA–GEO–YANGTZE–RIVER**, **MEM–CHINA–GRAND–CANAL** | ENTRY 0015 and river-cluster synthesis link Pearl to Yellow–Yangtze–Grand Canal (humiliation/recovery, Yuan precedent, PRC continuity). Consider adding MEM CONNECTIONS between Pearl and Yellow/Yangtze/Grand Canal where not already present (narrative connectivity; not replacing GEO content). |
| **MEM–CHINA–HONG–KONG**, **MEM–CHINA–GEO–PEARL–RIVER** | SYNTHESIS 0014 and SDI 0005 (China ↔ Francia/Germania cession–return). Optional: one sentence or footnote noting cross-civilisational parallel (Alsace–Lorraine cession–return) without overloading MEM content. |
