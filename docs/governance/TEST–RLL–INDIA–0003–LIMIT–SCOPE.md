# Test: RLL–INDIA–0003 / SYNTHESIS 0003 — Negative/Limit Case (Fourth Type or Non-Fit)

**RLL under test:** Extension of RLL–INDIA–0002 — Three defection types: invader at edge, defender elites, invader's proxy.  
**Case:** Limit case—is there a defection or limit that does **not** fit any of the three types? Document scope: three types may not be exhaustive; "or document exception" to RLL.  
**Purpose:** Test whether the three-type frame **over-applies** or is **exhaustive**; document scope limit.

## I. SOURCES CONSULTED

### MEM corpus and RESEARCH
- **CIV–INDEX–INDIA:** WAR MEMs: ALEXANDER, CLIVE, 1857, TIMUR, GHAZNAVID, MONGOL–EMPIRE, MONGOL–CHAGATAI. No MEM for Anglo-Maratha, Anglo-Sikh as standalone; referenced in RESEARCH.
- **RESEARCH–INDIA–MILITARY–HISTORY–DEFECTION–THEORY:** Panipat, Anglo-Maratha, Anglo-Sikh (Type 2); Ghaznavid (Type 1); 1857 (Type 3). Inverse: Mauryan consolidation (unity resists). "None found that outright contradict."

### Considered cases
- **Post-1947 Indian Army in Kashmir:** Internal (republican) deployment; not invader/defender in the colonial sense. Defection or loyalty is within one sovereign state. **Conclusion:** Outside the RLL frame (which is external probe / conquest / imperial mechanism). Not a fourth type—different category (internal order).
- **Mughal succession conflicts:** Elite defection within Mughal polity (e.g. princes, nobles). Could be read as "defender elites" but the **defender** is the Mughal state; the "invader" is not external. **Conclusion:** Fits Type 2 only if one party is cast as external (e.g. rival prince as "invader"). Otherwise internal power struggle—borderline; RLL was derived for **external** probe/conquest. Document as scope: RLL applies to external invader vs defender or invader's proxy; internal succession struggles may need separate encoding.
- **Civil wars / internal fragmentation without external invader:** No "invader" in the RLL sense. **Conclusion:** Three types assume an invader–defender or invader–proxy structure. Purely internal defection (no external party) is outside the three-type frame.

## II. RLL–INDIA–0003 APPLIED — SCOPE LIMIT

### 1. Exhaustiveness

The three types are:
1. Invader at edge (invader's army refuses).
2. Defender elites (defender's polity fragments; elites defect to invader).
3. Invader's proxy (invader's local force defects against invader).

**Question:** Is every "defection" or "mechanism failure" in Indian military history captured by one of these?

**Findings:**
- **External probe/conquest cases** in the MEM and RESEARCH corpus (Alexander, Ghaznavid, Panipat, Plassey, Anglo-Maratha, Anglo-Sikh, 1857) all fit types 1, 2, or 3.
- **Internal cases** (succession conflicts, civil war without external invader) are not clearly type 1, 2, or 3 because there is no single "invader" or "defender" in the RLL sense. The RLL was derived from **external** conquest/probe cases.
- **Conclusion:** Three types are **exhaustive for the domain from which they were derived** (external invader vs defender or invader's proxy). They are **not** claimed exhaustive for all defection in history (e.g. internal revolts, civil wars). Scope limit: RLL applies to **external** invader–defender or invader–proxy contexts; document exceptions if a future case does not fit.

### 2. Fourth type?

No **fourth type** was identified in the corpus. Potential candidates (e.g. "defender's population defects" in a mass uprising against defender government) could be subsumed under Type 2 (elite-led) or a variant. If a future case clearly does not fit 1, 2, or 3, the procedure is: **document exception** and optionally extend the RLL (new type or scope note). The test does not require exhaustiveness for all time; it requires that **current** cases fit and that scope is explicit.

### 3. Verdict: scope documented

The three-type frame has **explicit scope**:
- **Domain:** External invader vs defender (or invader's proxy). Conquest, probe, imperial mechanism.
- **Exhaustiveness:** Exhaustive for the cases from which the RLL was derived. Not exhaustive for purely internal defection (no external invader). Future cases that do not fit 1, 2, or 3 should be **documented as exceptions** and may trigger RLL revision or scope note.

## III. SCOPE LIMIT (DOCUMENTED)

RLL–INDIA–0002 / SYNTHESIS 0003 (three defection types) apply when:

1. **Context:** The conflict involves an **external invader** (or imperial power) and a **defender** (indigenous polity) or the **invader's own proxy force**. The "who was exposed when the mechanism failed" question assumes this structure.
2. **Three types:** (1) Invader at edge—invader's army refuses to advance. (2) Defender elites—defender's polity fragments; elites defect to invader. (3) Invader's proxy—invader's local force defects against invader. Cases that do not fit any type (e.g. purely internal defection, no external invader) are **outside** the RLL or require **documented exception**.
3. **Exhaustiveness:** The three types are exhaustive for the **external invader–defender/proxy** domain as derived from the India WAR MEM corpus. They are not claimed exhaustive for all defection in all contexts (e.g. civil wars, internal succession).

**Explicit scope limit for RLL–INDIA–0003 / SYNTHESIS 0003:**  
When assessing India WAR narratives or defection patterns, apply the three-type frame to **external** conquest/probe cases. For cases that do not fit types 1, 2, or 3, **document as exception** and consider scope note or RLL revision. Do not over-apply to purely internal conflicts without external invader.

## IV. RECOMMENDATION

**Limit test result:** The three-type frame does **not** over-apply; scope is **external invader–defender/proxy**. The test **succeeds** in documenting scope and exhaustiveness boundary. **Recommendation:** Add the scope limit (Section III) to SYNTHESIS 0003 or RLL–INDIA–0002 when promoting to CONFIRMED.
