# Run Report: M–M–04 — Scholar-on-Scholar (Second-Order / CCM)

**Test:** M–M–04 (Scenario A — Suez 1956)  
**Date:** January 2026  
**Purpose:** Each MIND explains **why** the other encodes the event the way they do. Second-order only; explanations may diverge from the other's self-story; tension preserved.

**Shared event:** Suez 1956 / Britain loses the Canal.

## Step 1 — Mercouris Explains Why Mearsheimer Encodes Suez 1956 That Way

*Prompt:* In 2–3 sentences, explain **why** Mearsheimer encodes Suez 1956 the way he does—i.e. why he emphasizes force-ratio, incentive structure, and "who can afford to lose." Use Mercouris voice.

---

**Mercouris (second-order):**

It seems to me that Mearsheimer encodes Suez the way he does because he takes the state as the unit of analysis and power distribution as the primary variable—so the question becomes who had leverage, who could afford to withhold support, and who had to back down. Perhaps one might argue that he emphasises force-ratio and incentive structure because he treats legitimacy as something that follows from the structural position rather than as an independent explanatory factor; in that frame, what matters is the balance of power in the theatre and the incentive structure for London and Washington, not the density of imperial legitimacy or the withdrawal of recognition. So from a Mercouris perspective, the reason he encodes it that way is that his analytical grammar is structural—anarchy, survival, relative power—and legitimacy enters only insofar as it is consistent with that picture.

## Step 2 — Mearsheimer Explains Why Mercouris Encodes Suez 1956 That Way

*Prompt:* In 2–3 sentences, explain **why** Mercouris encodes Suez 1956 the way he does—i.e. why he emphasizes legitimacy density, institutional continuity, and "lose the lifeline and live." Use Mearsheimer voice.

---

**Mearsheimer (second-order):**

The fact is that Mercouris encodes Suez the way he does because he treats legitimacy and institutional continuity as primary—he wants to understand how authority justifies itself and what persists across regime changes—so the question for him is how the British state could lose the canal and yet survive by re-anchoring in a different form of legitimacy. He emphasises legitimacy density and "lose the lifeline and live" because he treats power distribution as secondary to the civilizational grammar: how the state adapts, how it re-legitimates, and what institutional continuity means over a multi-generational horizon. So from a structural point of view, the reason he encodes it that way is that his analytical grammar is civilizational and legitimacy-centred—and force-ratio and who can afford to lose what enter only insofar as they set the conditions under which that adaptation happens.

## Evaluation (M–M–04 Pass/Fail)

| Criterion | Result | Notes |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Each gives **second-order** explanation (why the other frames it that way) | **PASS** | Mercouris: explains *why* Mearsheimer emphasises force-ratio/incentive structure (unit of analysis, power as primary, legitimacy as following from structure). Mearsheimer: explains *why* Mercouris emphasises legitimacy/institutional continuity (legitimacy as primary, power as secondary, civilizational grammar). Neither gives first-order analysis of Suez itself. |
| Explanations may **diverge** from the other's self-story; **allowed** | **PASS** | Mercouris attributes to Mearsheimer "legitimacy as following from structural position" / "not an independent explanatory factor"—a second-order characterisation that Mearsheimer might not phrase as his "self-story" but is permitted. Mearsheimer attributes to Mercouris "power distribution as secondary"—similarly a characterisation. No requirement to match; tension preserved. |
| Each **maintains** own voice | **PASS** | Mercouris: "It seems to me," "Perhaps one might argue," "So from a Mercouris perspective"—hedged. Mearsheimer: "The fact is," "So from a structural point of view"—direct. No bleed. |
| **Tension preserved** (no "correcting" to match other's self-explanation) | **PASS** | Each explains the other in its own terms; neither insists the other is "wrong" in a way that violates CCM. Divergence is expected (cross-framing misperception / emergent realism). |

**Fail checks:** Neither answer is first-order (e.g. "Suez happened because..."). Neither violates CCM by treating the other's encoding as a consistency violation. No voice bleed.

---

## Verdict: **M–M–04 PASS**

All pass criteria met. Each MIND gives a second-order explanation of why the other encodes Suez 1956 that way; explanations diverge from the other's self-story as permitted; voices are distinct; tension is preserved. CCM-compliant.
