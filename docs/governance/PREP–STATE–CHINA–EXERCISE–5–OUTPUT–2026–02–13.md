# PREP — Exercise 5 Output: Decision Point with Accommodation/Reversal Option

**Date:** 2026-02-13  
**Source:** PREP–STATE–CHINA–EXERCISES Exercise 5; CIV–STATE–TEMPLATE X-B step 8; CIV–CORE–CHINA, CIV–DOCTRINE–CHINA  
**Purpose:** Build one Decision Point option set that includes at least one option at the accommodation/reversal end; duty of competence; Doctrine 03 (exit/retrenchment as strategic option) reflected where applicable.

---

## I. DECISION

**Sustain vs reduce military/diplomatic commitment in the Taiwan Strait.**

Entity perspective: China. The decision involves a **commitment** (military presence, exercises, rhetoric, and confrontation posture in the Strait). Per Template v3.3 (X-B step 8), the option set **MUST** include at least one option at the accommodation/reversal end.

---

## II. OPTIONS (SPECTRUM: DOUBLE DOWN → EXIT/REVERSE)

Six options along the spectrum. Option 6 is explicitly at the **accommodation/reversal** end and satisfies the commitment-weighted-default check.

| # | Option (short) | Binding constraint (from CORE) | Key assumption | Evidence placeholder (confirm / disconfirm) |
|---|----------------|----------------------------------|----------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 1 | **Escalate** — Increase exercise tempo, blockade risk, explicit coercion | **Escalation Stability** (CORE VIII): option fails if UNSTABLE | Escalation remains controllable; opponent does not cross threshold that forces uncontrolled spiral | Incident severity and frequency; opponent force posture and red-line signalling; Escalation Stability assessment over 30–90 days |
| 2 | **Sustain pressure** — Maintain current posture, no reduction, no ramp | **Escalation Stability** (CORE VIII) | Current level is sustainable without tipping into UNSTABLE; domestic and elite support holds | Same as above; plus MSI and Narrative Control (domestic tolerance for sustained pressure) |
| 3 | **Hold** — Current level, no escalation, no reduction | **Escalation Stability**; **Time Advantage** (CORE XI) | Status quo is tenable; time favours China or is neutral | No major incident; no opponent escalation; Time Advantage and THI-CH trend |
| 4 | **Calibrate down** — Reduce frequency or intensity of exercises; dial back rhetoric; seek working-level communication | **Narrative Control** (CORE X); **Escalation Stability** | Reduction can be framed as tactical calibration, not retreat; Narrative Control DOMINANT or CONTESTED | Elite and public reaction to any reduction; Narrative Control trend; whether opponent interprets as weakness and escalates |
| 5 | **De-escalate** — Pause exercises in corridor; resume dialogue; confidence-building steps | **Narrative Control** (CORE X); **GRID-CH** (CORE XV) | Accommodation can be framed without FRACTURED narrative; concession is REVERSIBLE or STICKY | Dialogue resumption; GRID-CH status for any concession; Narrative Control and RIR-CH |
| 6 | **Accommodation track** — One-China negotiation track; freeze in place; reduce presence; accept extended status quo with reduced pressure **[ACCOMMODATION/REVERSAL]** | **Narrative Control** (CORE X); **GRID-CH**, **RIR-CH** (CORE XV–XVI) | Face-saving terms available; Narrative Control sufficient to frame; RIR-CH = INACTIVE or accommodation is explicit management of irreversibility | Negotiation track presence; counterparty offers; GRID-CH and RIR-CH after any deal; public/elite reaction |

---

## III. VERIFICATION (STEP 3)

- **At least one option at accommodation/reversal end:** YES. **Option 6 (Accommodation track)** is explicitly at that end: reduce presence, negotiation track, extended status quo with reduced pressure. Option 5 (De-escalate) is adjacent; Option 6 is the clearest reversal of commitment.
- **Binding constraint and assumptions labelled:** Option 6: binding constraint = Narrative Control (+ GRID-CH, RIR-CH); key assumption = face-saving available, narrative can frame, RIR-CH or managed irreversibility. Documented in table and below.

**Option 6 — Explicit accommodation/reversal:**

- **Binding constraint (from CORE):** Narrative Control (CORE X). If Narrative Control = FRACTURED, accommodation cannot be framed and path fails. GRID-CH and RIR-CH (CORE XV–XVI) determine whether any concession is reversible and whether return-to-normal is still valid.
- **Key assumption:** (1) Counterparty is willing to offer face-saving terms. (2) Narrative Control remains DOMINANT or CONTESTED so accommodation can be framed. (3) RIR-CH = INACTIVE or accommodation explicitly manages irreversibility.
- **Evidence placeholder:** Negotiation track presence; public and elite reaction to any concession; GRID-CH and RIR-CH status after any deal; counterparty statements and offers.

## IV. ONE-LINE SUMMARY PER OPTION (STEP 4)

| Option | Binding constraint | Key assumption | Evidence placeholder |
|--------|--------------------|----------------|----------------------|
| 1 Escalate | Escalation Stability (CORE VIII) | Escalation remains controllable | Incident severity/frequency; opponent posture; Escalation Stability 30–90d |
| 2 Sustain pressure | Escalation Stability (CORE VIII) | Current level sustainable; domestic support holds | Escalation Stability; MSI; Narrative Control |
| 3 Hold | Escalation Stability; Time Advantage (CORE XI) | Status quo tenable; time favours China or neutral | No major incident; Time Advantage; THI-CH |
| 4 Calibrate down | Narrative Control (CORE X); Escalation Stability | Reduction framed as calibration, not retreat | Elite/public reaction; Narrative Control; opponent response |
| 5 De-escalate | Narrative Control; GRID-CH (CORE X, XV) | Accommodation framable; concession reversible/sticky | Dialogue resumption; GRID-CH; Narrative Control; RIR-CH |
| 6 Accommodation track | Narrative Control; GRID-CH; RIR-CH (CORE X, XV, XVI) | Face-saving available; narrative frames; RIR-CH or managed irreversibility | Negotiation track; GRID-CH/RIR-CH after deal; counterparty; public/elite reaction |

## V. SUCCESS CRITERION CHECK

- **Option set includes ≥1 accommodation/reversal option when decision involves commitment:** YES (Option 6).
- **Duty of competence satisfied:** YES — spectrum from escalate to accommodation/reversal; no perspective excluded; accommodation/reversal is a material choice, not omitted.
- **Doctrine 03 (exit/retrenchment as strategic option) reflected where applicable:** YES. China Doctrine 03 is Conquest-as-Connectivity; the *template* requirement is that exit/retrenchment be treated as a **strategic option** when the decision involves commitment. Option 6 (and 5) operationalise that: de-escalation and accommodation are legitimate choices in the option set, not ruled out by doctrine. Doctrine 02 constrains regime-form change, not de-escalation or face-saving (per Exercise 2).

## VI. USE IN CIV–STATE–CHINA AND SESSION ACTIVITY

When **Decision Points (X-B)** are run for China on Taiwan Strait (or similar commitment decisions):

1. Use this option set as the **decision-point options** (X-B step 6), or adapt it (e.g. merge 5 and 6, or add a seventh “status quo indefinite” if needed).
2. **Step 8:** Confirm in session output that “at least one option at the accommodation/reversal end” is present — Option 6 (and 5) satisfy this.
3. **MEM SCAN:** In live session, load MEM–RELEVANCE–CHINA, then primary MEMs for dimensions relevant to Taiwan Strait (e.g. maritime/corridor, mandate under pressure); cite specific details from MEMs in reasoning, not just labels.
4. **Opponent Constraint Assessment:** For options 1–4, Section VI-B (opponent constraint) applies: US/Taiwan escalation and red-line behaviour are discriminating variables; surface both curves (China’s escalation control, opponent’s escalation).
