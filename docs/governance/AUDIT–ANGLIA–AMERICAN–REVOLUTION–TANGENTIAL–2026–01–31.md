## II. Factual Alignment

| Element | AMERICAN–REVOLUTION | Tangential MEMs | Verdict |
|--------|---------------------|------------------|---------|
| **Dates** | 1765–1783 (foundational phase) | WAR–AMERICAN–INDEPENDENCE 1775–1783; DECLARATION 1776; YORKTOWN 1781; Treaty of Paris 1783 | **Aligned.** Revolution spans grievance phase (1765) through treaty; war MEM correctly 1775–1783. |
| **Olive Branch Petition** | July 1775; quoted | — | No conflict. |
| **Declaration** | July 4, 1776; quoted; function as signal/alliance | DECLARATION–INDEPENDENCE: 1776; alliance signaling, moral justification | **Aligned.** |
| **Yorktown** | 1781; terminal containment, imperial options collapse | YORKTOWN MEM: 1781; Cornwallis, Franco–American coordination, nodal defeat | **Aligned.** |
| **Treaty of Paris** | 1783; Article 1 quoted; sovereignty relinquished by text | ADAMS: negotiator; WAR–AMERICAN–INDEPENDENCE: termination without trauma | **Aligned.** |
| **Causal chain** | Seven Years’ War → fiscal/admin pressures → imperial disputes | WAR–SEVEN–YEARS, PITT–ELDER, BRITISH–EMPIRE–NORTH–AMERICA (Seven Years’ War removes French barrier; postwar strain) | **Aligned.** |
| **Francia** | Alliance signaling; coalition; war “ceases to be colonial” | WAR–AMERICAN–INDEPENDENCE: French entry as systemic shift; YORKTOWN: Francien fleet | **Aligned.** |
| **First great generation** | Washington, Adams, Jefferson (Churchill) | ADAMS: Washington, Adams, Jefferson; Churchill Vol. 3 | **Aligned.** |

**Conclusion:** Factual alignment across primary and tangential MEMs is **consistent**. No date or event contradictions.

## III. Conceptual Alignment

- **Procedural secession / continuity-first:** AMERICAN–REVOLUTION, WAR–AMERICAN–INDEPENDENCE, YORKTOWN, DECLARATION–INDEPENDENCE, ADAMS, FEDERALIST–PAPERS, BRITISH–EMPIRE–NORTH–AMERICA all encode rebellion or exit in Anglian legal/procedural form; sovereignty ruptures, form persists; loss absorbed without regime collapse.
- **Declaration as tool:** Declaration as external signal, alliance (Francia), internal cohesion—aligned in AMERICAN–REVOLUTION and DECLARATION–INDEPENDENCE (and Kissinger/Durant usage).
- **Endurance over decisive battle:** Keegan-style survivability, coalition timing, force preservation—aligned in AMERICAN–REVOLUTION, WAR–AMERICAN–INDEPENDENCE, YORKTOWN.
- **Exit codification:** Treaty of Paris as text-based relinquishment; Ferguson “procedural exits”—aligned in AMERICAN–REVOLUTION, ADAMS, WAR–AMERICAN–INDEPENDENCE (termination without trauma).

**Conclusion:** Conceptual alignment is **strong**. Shared themes: portable procedure, grievance as legal indictment, universalism as tool, continuity-first vs reset (Francia contrast).

---

## IV. Strategic Alignment

- **Imperial exit:** Loss of Thirteen Colonies as controlled exit; empire continues; Canada as residual—AMERICAN–REVOLUTION, BRITISH–EMPIRE–NORTH–AMERICA, YORKTOWN, WAR–AMERICAN–INDEPENDENCE consistent.
- **War of 1812:** AMERICAN–REVOLUTION cited as “prior procedural secession”; 1812 tests residual tensions without reopening sovereignty—consistent.
- **LIT–* and HIST–TOCQUEVILLE:** Burke (colonial rights, restraint), Paine (catalyst, rupture), Locke/Hume/Milton/KJV (founders, continuity), Tocqueville (post-Revolution republic)—all point to AMERICAN–REVOLUTION or WAR–AMERICAN–INDEPENDENCE–YORKTOWN without contradiction.

**Conclusion:** Strategic alignment across event MEMs and person/LIT MEMs is **consistent**.

## V. Violations Logged (No Edits in LEARN)

### 1. MEM–ANGLIA–AMERICAN–REVOLUTION

| Issue | Type | Detail |
|-------|------|--------|
| Version mismatch | Internal | Title and footer: **v1.6**; metadata block: Version **1.7**, Supersedes v1.6. Footer should read v1.7 or metadata downgraded to 1.6. |
| Typo in MEM CONNECTIONS | Filename/label | Item 4: **MEM–ANGLIA–WAR–AMERICAN–INDEPENDENAD** → should be **MEM–ANGLIA–WAR–AMERICAN–INDEPENDENCE**. |
| Typo in MEM CONNECTIONS | Filename/label | Item 8: **MEM–FRANCIA–WAR–AMERICAN–INDEPENDENAD** → should be **MEM–FRANCIA–WAR–AMERICAN–INDEPENDENCE** (or correct Francia MEM filename if different). |
| Missing connection | Optional | DECLARATION–INDEPENDENCE is discussed in Section V but not listed in MEM CONNECTIONS. Consider adding for symmetry with ADAMS, FEDERALIST–PAPERS. |

### 2. MEM–ANGLIA–BRITISH–EMPIRE–NORTH–AMERICA

| Issue | Type | Detail |
|-------|------|--------|
| Wrong connection label | Filename | Section VII MEM CONNECTIONS: **MEM–ANGLIA–WAR–AMERICAN–REVOLUTION** — actual MEM filename is **MEM–ANGLIA–AMERICAN–REVOLUTION** (no "WAR–" prefix). Link should read MEM–ANGLIA–AMERICAN–REVOLUTION. |

### 3. MEM–ANGLIA–WAR–AMERICAN–CIVIL–GETTYSBURG

| Issue | Type | Detail |
|-------|------|--------|
| Wrong connection label | Filename | **MEM–ANGLIA–LAW–DECLARATION–INDEPENDENCE** — actual MEM filename is **MEM–ANGLIA–DECLARATION–INDEPENDENCE** (no "LAW–" prefix). Link should read MEM–ANGLIA–DECLARATION–INDEPENDENCE. |

### 4. MEM–ANGLIA–WAR–AMERICAN–INDEPENDENCE

| Issue | Type | Detail |
|-------|------|--------|
| Title/footer vs metadata | Internal | Header: **v1.1**; Version 1.2 in metadata; footer: **v1.2**. Minor: header could read v1.2 for consistency. |
| Template gap | Structure | No MEM CONNECTIONS section. CIV–MEM–TEMPLATE v2.9 requires MEM CONNECTIONS. Suggest adding connections to AMERICAN–REVOLUTION, YORKTOWN, DECLARATION–INDEPENDENCE, ADAMS, WAR–SEVEN–YEARS, PITT–ELDER, FRANCIA (as applicable). |

### 5. MEM–ANGLIA–WAR–AMERICAN–INDEPENDENCE–YORKTOWN

| Issue | Type | Detail |
|-------|------|--------|
| Section title | Template | Uses “CROSS-REFERENCED MEM FILES” rather than “MEM CONNECTIONS”; content is connection-like. Not a violation if template allows; note for v2.9 alignment. |
| Missing back-links | Optional | Does not list MEM–ANGLIA–AMERICAN–REVOLUTION or MEM–ANGLIA–WAR–AMERICAN–INDEPENDENCE in cross-references (lists WAR–AMERICAN–CIVIL, NELSON–TRAFALGAR, NAPOLEON, CANADA). Consider adding for discoverability. |

### 6. MEM–ANGLIA–DECLARATION–INDEPENDENCE

| Issue | Type | Detail |
|-------|------|--------|
| Template gap | Structure | No MEM CONNECTIONS section. Consider adding AMERICAN–REVOLUTION, WAR–AMERICAN–INDEPENDENCE, ADAMS, JEFFERSON, and optionally LIT–PAINE, LAW–FEDERALIST–PAPERS for template compliance and graph consistency. |

## VI. Summary

- **Factual–conceptual–strategic alignment:** MEM–ANGLIA–AMERICAN–REVOLUTION and the tangential Anglia MEMs reviewed are **aligned**. Dates, events, causal chain, and themes (procedural secession, continuity-first, exit codification, Francia as ally) are consistent.
- **Violations:** Logged above: version mismatch and INDEPENDENAD typos in AMERICAN–REVOLUTION; wrong link labels in BRITISH–EMPIRE–NORTH–AMERICA (WAR–AMERICAN–REVOLUTION) and WAR–AMERICAN–CIVIL–GETTYSBURG (LAW–DECLARATION–INDEPENDENCE); optional missing MEM CONNECTIONS or back-links in WAR–AMERICAN–INDEPENDENCE, YORKTOWN, DECLARATION–INDEPENDENCE.
- **Recommended follow-up (WRITE mode):** Correct AMERICAN–REVOLUTION version display and INDEPENDENAD typos; correct BRITISH–EMPIRE–NORTH–AMERICA and GETTYSBURG connection labels; add MEM CONNECTIONS to WAR–AMERICAN–INDEPENDENCE and DECLARATION–INDEPENDENCE per template; optionally add AMERICAN–REVOLUTION / WAR–AMERICAN–INDEPENDENCE to YORKTOWN cross-references.
