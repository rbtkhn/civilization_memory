# Audit: Russia GEO Files — Verbatim Quotation Compliance

**Classification:** Governance · GEO–MEM Audit  
**Scope:** All MEM–RUSSIA–GEO–* files (32)  
**Criteria:** CIV–MEM–TEMPLATE VIII (20% verbatim quote standard), Section XXII (GEO–MEM ARC quote sections); CIV–ARC–RUSSIA (verbatim, ≥25 words, attribution); CMC–BOOTSTRAP (four eras verbatim)  
**Date:** February 2026

## 1. Verbatim Quotation Requirements (Reference)

### 1.1 Template (CIV–MEM–TEMPLATE)

- **VIII:** All MEM files MUST contain at least **20% verbatim quotes by word count**. Q ÷ Total × 100 ≥ 20. Only text inside quotation marks counts as Q.
- **XXII.B.3:** GEO–MEM files MUST contain **ARC QUOTE SECTIONS (4 required):**
  - ARC-T-ANCIENT / Category A — Ancient Sources
  - ARC-T-MEDIEVAL / Category B — Medieval Sources
  - ARC-T-EARLY-MOD / Category C — Early Modern Historiography
  - ARC-T-MODERN / Category D — Modern Scholarship
- **XXII:** GEO–MEM blend: ~2/3 strategic analysis, **~1/3 ARC verbatim quotes** demonstrating permanent patterns.

### 1.2 CIV–ARC–RUSSIA

- **Verbatim:** Quotations must be verbatim. Paraphrase may supplement but may NOT replace verbatim quotation.
- **Minimum length:** ≥25 words per quotation (unless manuscript limits apply).
- **Attribution:** Author, work, translation if applicable.
- **Category A (Ancient):** At least two distinct ancient-source quotations per MEM; each ≥25 words.
- **Category B (Medieval):** One-line relevance justification for admissibility.

### 1.3 CMC–BOOTSTRAP

- Four mandatory categories: ANCIENT (pre-500, verbatim ≥25 words), MEDIEVAL (500–1500, verbatim ≥25 words), EARLY MODERN, MODERN.
- GEO–MEMs require all 4 eras in ARC timeline.

### 1.4 Format Convention (Russia GEO corpus)

- **Blockquote:** Verbatim text in markdown blockquote (`> "..."`) with attribution line `— Author, *Work* (year/edition)`.
- **Consistency:** Most Russia GEO–MEMs use blockquote for every verbatim quote; attribution on following line.

## 3. File-by-File Findings (Non-Compliant and Format Gaps)

### 3.1 VOLGA–RIVER — Format gap

- **Issue:** One verbatim quote (John Erickson, *The Road to Stalingrad*) is in quotation marks but **not** in blockquote (`>`) format; attribution on following line.
- **Compliance:** Four ARC sections present; other quotes correctly blockquoted; attribution present. **Recommendation:** Convert Erickson quote to blockquote for consistency.

### 3.2 WHITE–SEA — Format and section count

- **Issue:** Class is Subject MEM (not GEO–MEM); has Category A, B, C (and possibly D—not verified). Verbatim quotes use straight `"..."` **without** blockquote (`>`).
- **Compliance:** Declared 20% COMPLIANT. **Recommendation:** Use blockquote format for all verbatim quotes to align with GEO/Subject MEM convention; confirm Category D present.

### 3.3 LAKE–LADOGA — Format

- **Issue:** All four Category sections present; verbatim quotes use `"..."` **without** blockquote (`>`). Attribution present (e.g. Tacitus, Primary Chronicle, Olearius, Erickson, Hosking).
- **Compliance:** Four eras covered; content verbatim. **Recommendation:** Convert quotes to blockquote format for consistency with rest of Russia GEO corpus.

### 3.4 ARCTIC–OCEAN — No ARC sections

- **Issue:** No ARC Category A/B/C/D sections. File contains strategic analysis, Strategic Insights, GEO–MEM CONNECTIONS, GEO–MEM BIBLIOGRAPHY (Mearsheimer, Mackinder), INGEST BOOTSTRAP. **No verbatim quote blocks.**
- **Compliance:** Fails template XXII.B.3 (4 ARC quote sections) and VIII (20% verbatim). **Recommendation:** Add four ARC quote sections with verbatim blockquotes (Ancient, Medieval, Early Modern, Modern) from CIV–ARC–RUSSIA–approved sources.

### 3.5 CRIMEA — No ARC sections

- **Issue:** No ARC Category A/B/C/D sections. Structure: strategic analysis, Strategic Insights, GEO–MEM CONNECTIONS, GEO–MEM BIBLIOGRAPHY, INGEST BOOTSTRAP. **No verbatim quote blocks.**
- **Compliance:** Fails XXII.B.3 and VIII. **Recommendation:** Add four ARC quote sections with verbatim blockquotes.

### 3.6 FOREST–ZONE — No ARC sections

- **Issue:** No ARC quote sections; BIBLIOGRAPHY and strategic sections only. **No verbatim quote blocks.**
- **Compliance:** Fails XXII.B.3 and VIII. **Recommendation:** Add four ARC quote sections with verbatim blockquotes.

### 3.7 LAKE–BAIKAL — No ARC sections

- **Issue:** No ARC quote sections; strategic analysis and BIBLIOGRAPHY only. **No verbatim quote blocks.**
- **Compliance:** Fails XXII.B.3 and VIII. **Recommendation:** Add four ARC quote sections with verbatim blockquotes.

### 3.8 CARPATHIANS — No ARC sections

- **Issue:** No ARC quote sections; strategic analysis and BIBLIOGRAPHY only. **No verbatim quote blocks.**
- **Compliance:** Fails XXII.B.3 and VIII. **Recommendation:** Add four ARC quote sections with verbatim blockquotes.

## 4. Cross-Cutting Findings

### 4.1 Full compliance (24 files)

Twenty-four Russia GEO files have all four ARC quote sections, blockquote-formatted verbatim quotes, and clear attribution. They meet the structural requirement for verbatim evidence (XXII.B.3). Spot-check of Volga, Dnieper, Neva, Oka, Caspian, Steppe confirms ≥25-word quotes and author/work attribution in blockquote form.

### 4.2 Missing ARC sections (5 files)

**ARCTIC–OCEAN, CRIMEA, FOREST–ZONE, LAKE–BAIKAL, CARPATHIANS** contain no ARC Category A/B/C/D sections and no verbatim quote blocks. They declare GEO–MEM and MEARSHEIMER cognition but do not satisfy the Proportional Blend Law’s 1/3 ARC verbatim component or the 20% verbatim standard. These five files require full ARC quote insertion to comply.

### 4.3 Format inconsistencies (3 files)

- **VOLGA–RIVER:** One quote (Erickson) in quotation marks but not in blockquote.
- **WHITE–SEA:** All quotes in `"..."` without `>`; Subject MEM, different structure but same verbatim/attribution expectation.
- **LAKE–LADOGA:** All quotes in `"..."` without `>`.

Converting these to blockquote does not change verbatim content but aligns with corpus convention and simplifies validation (quote words = lines starting with `>`).

### 4.4 20% word count

No automated word count was run. Template requires Q ≥ 20% of total words. Files with four substantial ARC sections and multiple blockquotes per section (e.g. Volga, Dnieper, Caspian, Steppe) are likely compliant. The five files with **no** quote sections cannot meet 20%. Recommendation: run a word-count validation (e.g. script or manual sample) for files that have ARC sections to confirm Q ÷ Total ≥ 0.20.

### 4.5 Attribution and ≥25 words

Sampled files (Volga, Dnieper, Atlantic, Oka) use consistent attribution (`— Author, *Work* (year)` or `(trans. X)`). Quote lengths in sampled blocks exceed 25 words. No systematic check of every quote in all 32 files was performed; spot-checks suggest compliance where blockquotes exist.

## 5. Summary Table

| Status | Count | Files |
|--------|-------|--------|
| **Fully compliant** (4 ARC sections + blockquote throughout) | 24 | Dnieper, Don, Neva, Oka, Ob, Moskva, Dvina, Amur, Vistula, Dniester (10 rivers); Baltic, Bering, Caspian, Black, Azov, Pacific, Gulf Finland, Atlantic (8); Steppe, Caucasus, Urals, Tundra, Taiga, Altai (6) |
| **Format gap only** (4 sections present; quotes not in blockquote) | 3 | Volga (Erickson quote), White Sea, Lake Ladoga |
| **Missing ARC sections** (no verbatim quote sections) | 5 | Arctic Ocean, Crimea, Forest Zone, Lake Baikal, Carpathians |
| **Total** | 32 | All MEM–RUSSIA–GEO–* files |

---

## 6. Recommended Actions

| Priority | Action | Files |
|----------|--------|--------|
| **P1** | Add four ARC quote sections (A/B/C/D) with verbatim blockquotes (≥25 words per quote, CIV–ARC–RUSSIA–approved sources) | ARCTIC–OCEAN, CRIMEA, FOREST–ZONE, LAKE–BAIKAL, CARPATHIANS |
| **P2** | Convert existing verbatim quotes to blockquote format (`> "..."` + `— Author, Work`) | VOLGA–RIVER (Erickson), WHITE–SEA (all), LAKE–LADOGA (all) |
| **P3** | Run 20% verbatim word-count validation on all 32 files (or on all with ARC sections) and document result | All 32 |
| **P4** | Confirm White Sea has Category D (Modern) and that all quotes are verbatim (no paraphrase) | WHITE–SEA |
