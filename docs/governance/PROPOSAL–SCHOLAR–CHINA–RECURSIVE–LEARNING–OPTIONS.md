# PROPOSAL — Scholar-China Recursive Learning Options

**Purpose:** State that **recursive learning is the designed outcome of OGE in LEARN mode**, and define option templates so OGE reliably produces that outcome under CIV–SCHOLAR–CHINA.  
**Governed by:** CIV–SCHOLAR–CHINA v2.0 § XI (OGE Specification), CMC–BOOTSTRAP (LEARN mode, OGE CONNECTION AWARENESS), CIV–SCHOLAR–TEMPLATE v2.10  
**Status:** Proposal (not yet adopted in CIV–SCHOLAR–CHINA)  
**Last Update:** February 2026

I. RECURSIVE LEARNING AS DESIGNED OUTCOME OF OGE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

**Recursive learning is the designed outcome of OGE in LEARN mode.** OGE is not merely a menu of six choices; it is the mechanism that **produces** recursive learning. Each LEARN turn ends with OGE; the user’s choice (A–F) **directs** the next turn’s content; that next turn again ends with OGE. No single turn is intended to resolve the question—closure is deferred; the next turn is always implied by the option set. Categories that structure options so they deliver this outcome per CIV–SCHOLAR–CHINA § XI: **Ingestion**, **Exploration**, **Analysis**, **Synthesis**, **Transition**, **Observation**.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. SIX OPTION SLOTS (BINDING)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

OGE in LEARN mode is **designed to produce recursive learning**: each option directs the creation of the next response, which again ends with OGE. The six slots below are the structure that delivers this outcome.

| Slot | Role | Requirement |
|------|------|-------------|
| **A** | Mercouris | Legitimacy/civilizational frame; concrete anchor (person, place, event) |
| **B** | Mearsheimer | Structural/power/chokepoint frame; concrete anchor |
| **C** | Barnes | Liability/jurisdiction/constraint frame; concrete anchor |
| **D** | Connection-derived | Traversal (follow MEM CONNECTIONS edge), gap (missing MEM), or comparison (cross-civ) |
| **E** | Continuation / time–space | Deeper on current thread, or move era/region |
| **F** | Synthesis / stopping | Session recap or optional stopping |

POST-BARNES variant: A = Mercouris responds to Barnes; B = Mearsheimer responds to Barnes; C–F unchanged in role (content can shift).

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. RECURSIVE LEARNING OPTION TEMPLATES (CHINA)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Templates are phrase patterns; instantiate with **concrete anchors** (person, place, event).

**Ingestion**
- Mercouris: "Legitimacy encoding of [EVENT/PLACE] in [MEM/CONCEPT]."
- Mearsheimer: "Force ratios / chokepoints for [WAR/REGION] — [PLACE], [PLACE]."
- Barnes: "Jurisdiction / liability in [TREATY/INSTITUTION] — who was on the hook."
- Connection: "Trace [MEM-A] CONNECTIONS to [MEM-B] (or to missing MEM)."
- Continuation: "Map [SOURCE/CONCEPT] onto [MEM cluster]; next ingestion."
- Synthesis: "Synthesis: [session theme]; next step WRITE or governance."

**Exploration**
- Mercouris: "[PLACE/EVENT] as legitimacy node in [narrative]."
- Mearsheimer: "Compare [THEATER-A] chokepoint logic vs [THEATER-B] (e.g. Song–Yuan vs Opium)."
- Barnes: "Who had compulsory authority in [treaty port / post-treaty]."
- Connection: "Trace [MEM] CONNECTIONS; propose traversal to [connected MEM]."
- Continuation: "Explore [MEM or CONCEPT]; era/region shift to [ANCHOR]."
- Synthesis: "Recap exploration; gaps and connections."

**Analysis**
- Mercouris: "Legitimacy density of [THESIS] for [MEM]."
- Mearsheimer: "Balance of power / incentive structure in [WAR/YEAR]."
- Barnes: "Constraint hierarchy in [TREATY/PROTOCOL]; defection incentive."
- Connection: "Analyze [MEM] using CONNECTIONS 'Breaks if removed' text."
- Continuation: "Analyze [competing hypothesis] or [next MEM in chain]."
- Synthesis: "Analysis recap; tensions preserved."

**Synthesis**
- Mercouris: "Synthesis (non-binding): civilizational encoding of [THEME]."
- Mearsheimer: "Synthesis (non-binding): structural pattern [THEME]."
- Barnes: "Synthesis (non-binding): liability/jurisdiction pattern [THEME]."
- Connection: "Synthesis across CONNECTIONS: [MEM-A], [MEM-B], [MEM-C]."
- Continuation: "Stage RLL candidate or Doctrine Registry entry (Phase I non-binding)."
- Synthesis: "Session synthesis; optional freeze or transition to WRITE."

**Transition**
- Mercouris: "Transition to [new MEM cluster or civilization] — legitimacy lens."
- Mearsheimer: "Transition to [new war/region] — force-ratio lens."
- Barnes: "Transition to [new treaty/institution] — jurisdiction lens."
- Connection: "Transition via CONNECTIONS to [connected civ or MEM]."
- Continuation: "Transition to WRITE mode: propose [MEM–CHINA–WAR–OPIUM / GEO / etc.]."
- Synthesis: "Transition recap; handoff to WRITE or IMAGINE."

**Observation**
- Mercouris: "Observation: [EPHEMERAL or CANONICAL] — [event/pattern]."
- Mearsheimer: "Observation: structural [pattern] in [region/period]."
- Barnes: "Observation: liability [pattern] in [institution]."
- Connection: "Observation: gap or anomaly in MEM graph at [node]."
- Continuation: "Observation log entry; next observation target."
- Synthesis: "Observation layer recap; no binding."

IV. EXAMPLE INSTANTIATION (CURRENT CHINA SESSION)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Current thread: Ferguson ingested; Opium Wars (one MEM); treaty ports (Shanghai, Nanjing); Qing, Boxer; chokepoints; GEO gap (Pearl/Yangtze). Example recursive options:

**A** — Mercouris: Legitimacy encoding of treaty ports (Shanghai, Nanjing) in century of humiliation.  
**B** — Mearsheimer: Shanghai and Nanjing as chokepoints in MEM–CHINA–WAR–OPIUM force-ratio logic.  
**C** — Barnes: Jurisdiction in treaty ports and Conventions (Nanjing 1842, Beijing 1860).  
**D** — Trace Shanghai/Nanjing to MEM–CHINA–DYNASTY–QING (external pressures, treaty encoding).  
**E** — Map Ferguson "killer apps" onto Qing institutional rigidity (Civilization frame).  
**F** — Synthesis: Ferguson ingested; Opium Wars one MEM; Canton–Nanjing–Beijing; GEO gap; next step WRITE or governance.

V. EMBEDDING IN CIV–SCHOLAR–CHINA
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

**Proposed:** Add a subsection under § XI (OGE Specification) or a new Section (e.g. **XI.B RECURSIVE LEARNING OPTION TEMPLATES**) that:

1. References this document (PROPOSAL–SCHOLAR–CHINA–RECURSIVE–LEARNING–OPTIONS.md).
2. States that LEARN mode OGE SHOULD follow the six slots (A–F) and the category templates when instantiating options.
3. Requires concrete anchor (person, place, event) per option.
4. Preserves POST-BARNES rule (A = Mercouris responds to Barnes, B = Mearsheimer responds to Barnes).

**Non-binding:** Phase I does not require every OGE to use these templates; they are a **recommended** structure for recursive learning chains. Adoption is optional until explicitly frozen in CIV–SCHOLAR–CHINA.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. SUMMARY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

- **Recursive learning as designed outcome:** OGE in LEARN mode is designed to produce recursive learning; each option directs the creation of the next response, which again ends with OGE. Chain continues until user stops or chooses F (synthesis/stopping).
- **Six slots:** A (Mercouris), B (Mearsheimer), C (Barnes), D (connection-derived), E (continuation/time–space), F (synthesis/stopping).
- **Categories:** Ingestion, Exploration, Analysis, Synthesis, Transition, Observation—templates provided for each.
- **Concrete anchor:** Every option includes at least one person, place, or event.
- **Proposal status:** For governance review; embedding in CIV–SCHOLAR–CHINA optional.

**Propagated to (February 2026):** The insight "recursive learning is the designed outcome of OGE in LEARN mode" has been propagated to: CMC–BOOTSTRAP (LEARN MODE COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL); CIV–SCHOLAR–TEMPLATE § XI (OGE IN LEARN MODE); CIV–SCHOLAR–CHINA § XI (OGE SPECIFICATION); .cursor/rules/cmc-oge-enforcement.mdc (OGE Ontology); .cursor/rules/cmc-scholar-mode.mdc (protocol intro).
