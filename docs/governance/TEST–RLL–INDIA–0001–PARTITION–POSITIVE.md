# Test: RLL–INDIA–0001 — Positive Case (Partition 1947)

**RLL under test:** RLL–INDIA–0001 (PROPOSED) — "Loss of origin basin (Indus) is survivable without civilizational redefinition; loss of heartland basin (Ganges) is not—control of the Ganges equals civilizational survivability."  
**Case:** Partition of British India (1947)—Radcliffe Line severs Indus basin from Indian sovereignty; Ganges basin retained within Republic of India.  
**Scope:** MEM corpus + ARC source base (CIV–ARC–INDIA v3.0).  
**Purpose:** Validate RLL–INDIA–0001 against the Partition case: Indus = origin (lost without civilizational collapse); Ganges = permanence (retained; civilizational survivability).

## I. SOURCES CONSULTED

### MEM corpus (primary)
- **MEM–INDIA–GEO–INDUS–RIVER:** Indus as "India's western civilizational origin spine"; "origins, not dominance"; "India can lose geography without losing civilization"; "Partition sever[s] Indus from India"; "India survives separation from its birthplace"; "memory outlasts territory."
- **MEM–INDIA–GEO–GANGES–RIVER:** Ganges as "India's enduring civilizational heartland"; "Where the Indus is origin, the Ganges is permanence"; "Control of the Ganges equals civilizational survivability"; "Regimes change; basin persists"; "Empires repeatedly reconstitute along the Ganges" (Mauryan through Republican India).
- **MEM–INDIA–PARTITION:** "Forced civilizational rupture event"; Radcliffe Line; "fractured demographic continuity without dissolving India's deeper civilizational substrate"; India "retains administrative spine"; "Preserves continuity through constitution-building"; Pakistan emerges with western (Indus) territory.

### ARC-listed sources (CIV–ARC–INDIA v3.0)
| ARC-T        | Author / Work | Use in test |
|--------------|----------------|-------------|
| ARC-T-MODERN | **Will Durant** — *Our Oriental Heritage*, *The Case for India* | Civilizational continuity; India as "mother of us all"; continuity from Mohenjo-daro to Gandhi; village democracy. |
| ARC-T-MODERN | **Ramachandra Guha** — *India After Gandhi* | Post-Partition Indian state formation; continuity of republic; survivability of Indian democracy and plural framework. |
| ARC-T-MODERN | **John Keay** — *India: A History* | Long durée of Indian civilizational geography; Indus and Ganges in historical narrative. |

### Supplementary
- Standard historiography: Radcliffe Line (Aug 1947); Punjab and Bengal divided; Indus basin largely to Pakistan; Ganges basin (Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal) to India; Republic of India survives; Pakistan and India as successor states.

## II. RLL–INDIA–0001 APPLIED (PARTITION 1947)

### 1. Activation trigger

RLL applies when "assessing Indian civilizational survivability or when interpreting MEM–INDIA–GEO–* for continuity claims." Partition 1947 is the **severance** case: sovereign territory of British India divided; Indus basin passes to Pakistan; Ganges basin remains in India. The RLL's claim—origin (Indus) can be lost; permanence (Ganges) cannot be lost without civilizational redefinition—is explicitly tested.

### 2. Pattern: "Origin can be lost; permanence cannot"

**Indus severed, India survives**
- **MEM (GEO–INDUS–RIVER):** "Partition sever[s] Indus from India"; "Civilizational origin outside modern sovereignty"; "India survives separation from its birthplace"; "India can lose geography without losing civilization"; "Memory outlasts territory."
- **MEM (PARTITION):** India "retains administrative spine"; "Preserves continuity through constitution-building"; "fractured demographic continuity without dissolving India's deeper civilizational substrate."
- **Conclusion:** Indus (origin) was severed from Indian sovereignty in 1947. The Republic of India did not collapse; civilizational continuity was preserved. RLL's first limb holds: loss of origin basin is survivable.

**Ganges retained**
- **MEM (GEO–GANGES–RIVER):** Ganges basin is "enduring civilizational heartland"; "Control of the Ganges equals civilizational survivability"; "Regimes change; basin persists"; core Indian state (UP, Bihar, Bengal portions) retains the Ganges.
- **Conclusion:** Partition did not sever the Ganges from India. The heartland basin remained under Indian sovereignty. RLL's second limb is not falsified—Ganges was not lost, so the counterfactual (loss of Ganges = civilizational redefinition) is not tested here; the positive case (Indus lost, Ganges retained, India survives) is consistent with the RLL.

**Dual pattern**
- **MEM:** "Where the Indus is origin, the Ganges is permanence." Partition applies severance to the origin (Indus), not to the permanence (Ganges). India survives because the heartland (Ganges) was retained.
- **Conclusion:** "Origin can be lost, permanence cannot" is validated: origin (Indus) was lost; permanence (Ganges) was not lost; India survived without civilizational redefinition.

### 3. Three derivations (with ARC)

- **Mercouris:** Legitimacy and institutional continuity; civilizational encoding of geography. **Fit:** Indus encodes origin—lost at Partition without dissolving Indian legitimacy; Ganges encodes permanence—retained, and republican India's continuity is asserted through the heartland. Institutional continuity (constitution, administrative spine) preserved because the Ganges basin remained.
- **Mearsheimer:** Control and survivability chokepoint; structural geometry. **Fit:** Loss of Indus did not remove India's demographic and strategic core (Ganges). Control of the Ganges basin remained; structural survivability maintained. Origin basin (Indus) was expendable in sovereignty terms; heartland (Ganges) was not.
- **Barnes:** Liability and mechanism; who bore the cost of severance. **Fit:** Partition imposed liability on both states; the severance of Indus placed "origin" outside India's jurisdiction. Who benefits from basin control: India retained the basin that "equals civilizational survivability"; Pakistan gained the origin basin. The liability chain (who lost what) aligns with the RLL—India "lost" origin but retained permanence.

### 4. MEM vs ARC: consistency

- **No contradiction:** MEM's "origin vs permanence," "India survives separation from its birthplace," and "Control of the Ganges equals civilizational survivability" align with post-Partition historiography (Guha: India After Gandhi—republican continuity; Keay: long geography). ARC does not contradict the dual-basin grammar.
- **ARC adds:** Guha's detailed narrative of post-1947 Indian state formation and plural survival; Durant's civilizational continuity framing (villages, Ashoka, Akbar) supports the "permanence" encoding of the Ganges heartland.
- **Scope:** Partition case confirms RLL–INDIA–0001 for the severance-of-origin scenario: Indus lost, Ganges retained, India survived.

## III. LIMIT OF TEST

This test validates the **positive** case only: Partition severed Indus, retained Ganges, India survived. It does not test the **counterfactual** (what would happen if Ganges were severed)—that remains a linchpin assumption. The test confirms that the observed outcome (1947) is consistent with the RLL.

## IV. VERDICT

**RLL–INDIA–0001 holds** for the Partition case (1947) **with MEM + ARC**. Validated: (1) Indus (origin) severed, India survives; (2) Ganges (permanence) retained; (3) "origin can be lost, permanence cannot" pattern consistent; (4) three derivations apply; (5) no ARC contradiction. **Recommendation:** Partition positive test supports freeze and promotion of RLL–INDIA–0001 / SYNTHESIS 0001.
