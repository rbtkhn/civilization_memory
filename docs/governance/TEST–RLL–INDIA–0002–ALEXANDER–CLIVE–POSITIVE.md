# Test: RLL–INDIA–0002 — Positive Case (Alexander and Clive)

**RLL under test:** RLL–INDIA–0002 (PROPOSED) — Two modes of limit: invader's mechanism fails (exposure on commander) OR defender's mechanism fails (exposure on indigenous polity); same question (who was exposed when the mechanism failed), opposite answers. Civilizational endurance preserved in both (intact or delayed).  
**Case:** MEM–INDIA–WAR–ALEXANDER (invader at Hyphasis); MEM–INDIA–WAR–CLIVE (defender at Plassey).  
**Scope:** MEM corpus + ARC source base (CIV–ARC–INDIA v3.0).  
**Purpose:** Validate RLL–INDIA–0002 with MEM + ARC; confirm mechanism-failure encoding and three derivations.

## I. SOURCES CONSULTED

### MEM corpus (primary)
- **MEM–INDIA–WAR–ALEXANDER:** "India defeats invasion without decisive battle"; "at Hyphasis the invader's mechanism fails—force at distance binds; army defection exposes the commander"; "Victory occurs at edges, not core"; "Greek presence transient"; "Mauryan consolidation follows."
- **MEM–INDIA–WAR–CLIVE:** "India's decisive loss to corporate–procedural conquest, not military defeat"; "Battle of Plassey is decisive psychologically, not militarily"; "defender's mechanism fails (elite defection, political fragmentation)"; "India collapses politically before collapsing militarily"; "Civilizational endurance delayed, not destroyed"; "India fell to contracts, not cannons."

### ARC-listed sources (CIV–ARC–INDIA v3.0)
| ARC-T        | Author / Work | Use in test |
|--------------|----------------|-------------|
| ARC-T-ANCIENT | **Arrian** — *Anabasis*, *Indica* | Alexander's India campaign; Hyphasis mutiny; army refusal. |
| ARC-T-ANCIENT | **Herodotus** (ARC–PERSIA-T-ANCIENT) | India satrapy; northwest context Alexander encountered. |
| ARC-T-MODERN | **Will Durant** — *The Case for India* | British conquest as "invasion and destruction of a high civilization by a trading company"; "bribing and murdering, annexing and stealing"; exploitation, not only battlefield. |
| ARC-T-MODERN | **Niall Ferguson** — *Empire* | India as "jewel in the crown"; Company-to-Crown; "administrative laboratory"; Plassey and extraction. |

### Supplementary
- Standard historiography: Hyphasis (326 BC)—Macedonian army refused to advance; Alexander turned back. Plassey (1757)—Company forces and defecting Nawab commanders; limited European manpower; political and financial leverage decisive.

## II. RLL–INDIA–0002 APPLIED (ALEXANDER AND CLIVE)

### 1. Activation trigger

RLL applies when "assessing India WAR MEMs or when interpreting 'who was exposed when the mechanism failed' in external-probe or conquest narratives." Alexander and Clive are the two canonical cases from which the RLL was derived.

### 2. Pattern: Mechanism failure, not decisive field defeat

**Alexander (invader's mechanism fails)**
- **MEM:** Limit at Hyphasis; "invader's mechanism fails"; "army defection exposes the commander"; "India defeats invasion without decisive battle"; "Depth defeats speed."
- **ARC:** Arrian (Anabasis/Indica) records army refusal at Hyphasis; Greek sources support "limit at edge" rather than "defeated in battle."
- **Conclusion:** Limit encoded via mechanism failure (army refused); exposure on Alexander. No decisive Indian field victory that destroyed the invader—the invader's own instrument (army) failed. RLL first mode holds.

**Clive (defender's mechanism fails)**
- **MEM:** "Defender's mechanism fails (elite defection, political fragmentation)"; "Battle of Plassey decisive psychologically, not militarily"; "India fell to contracts, not cannons"; "Internal disunity invites procedural domination."
- **ARC:** Durant—conquest as "invasion and destruction" by "trading company"; "bribing and murdering"; Ferguson—India as administrative laboratory, Company-to-Crown. Both support conquest via leverage and political fracture, not primarily pitched battle.
- **Conclusion:** Limit encoded via mechanism failure (defender's elites defected, polity fragmented); exposure on Nawab/indigenous polity. No single decisive field defeat of a unified Indian army—defender's cohesion failed. RLL second mode holds.

**Opposite locus**
- Alexander: invader's mechanism fails → exposure on **commander**. Clive: defender's mechanism fails → exposure on **indigenous polity**. Same question—who was exposed when the mechanism failed—opposite answers. **Conclusion:** Two-mode structure validated.

**Civilizational endurance**
- **MEM (Alexander):** "Greek presence transient"; "Mauryan consolidation follows"; "No cultural overwrite." **MEM (Clive):** "Civilizational endurance delayed, not destroyed"; "Endurance resumes only after unity restoration."
- **Conclusion:** Both MEMs preserve India's civilizational endurance (intact or delayed). RLL requirement satisfied.

### 3. Three derivations (with ARC)

- **Mercouris:** Legitimacy and civilizational encoding; who was exposed carries different weight in each civilization's story. **Fit:** At Hyphasis the army's refusal is the limit of the commander's reach; at Plassey elite defection is the failure of defender's cohesion. Civilizational endurance preserved in both; encoding differs by locus. Durant and Ferguson support legitimacy/extraction framing.
- **Mearsheimer:** Structural limit; force at distance vs fragmentation; incentive structure. **Fit:** Alexander—force at distance, supply, scale; army defection as structural limit. Clive—fragmentation, elite defection incentive; defender's cohesion failed. Both: limit via mechanism, not decisive battle. ARC supports structural reading (Company, extraction, administrative takeover).
- **Barnes:** Who was exposed when the mechanism failed; jurisdiction and liability. **Fit:** Alexander—exposure on commander (army refused, he had to turn back). Clive—exposure on indigenous polity (Nawab, elites; Company gained jurisdiction through defection and treaty). Liability chain clear in both.

### 4. MEM vs ARC: consistency

- **No contradiction:** MEM's "mechanism failure," "decisive psychologically not militarily," "contracts not cannons," and "civilizational endurance preserved" align with Arrian (Hyphasis), Durant (Company exploitation), Ferguson (administrative takeover). ARC does not emphasize decisive field victory as the cause of outcome in either case.
- **ARC adds:** Arrian's narrative of army refusal; Durant's moral framing of Company "plunder"; Ferguson's structural view of India as laboratory. All consistent with mechanism-failure encoding.
- **Scope:** Alexander and Clive positive test confirms RLL–INDIA–0002 for the two-mode (invader/defender mechanism fails) pattern.

## III. LIMIT OF TEST

This test validates the **two canonical cases** (Alexander, Clive) only. It does not test the **third defection type** (invader's proxy—1857); that is covered in TEST–RLL–INDIA–0003. The test confirms that mechanism failure (not decisive field defeat) is the primary encoding in both MEMs and that ARC supports that encoding.

## IV. VERDICT

**RLL–INDIA–0002 holds** for Alexander and Clive **with MEM + ARC**. Validated: (1) mechanism failure (not decisive defeat); (2) opposite locus (invader vs defender); (3) civilizational endurance preserved; (4) three derivations apply; (5) no ARC contradiction. **Recommendation:** Alexander/Clive positive test supports freeze and promotion of RLL–INDIA–0002 / SYNTHESIS 0002.
