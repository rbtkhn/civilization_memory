**Date:** 2026-02-13  
**Source:** Exercise 4, PREP–STATE–CHINA–EXERCISES  
**Topic:** Strategic position for China regarding Taiwan  
**Purpose:** One analytical block in three paragraphs, one per perspective; content-based names only; no system-internal terms; tensions preserved.

## I. THREE-PARAGRAPH BLOCK

**Paragraph A — Legitimacy and institutional continuity**

China’s position on Taiwan is framed through the claim of territorial and civilizational continuity: the island is encoded as part of the realm whose unity was broken by foreign imposition and must be restored. Mandate stability and narrative control depend on the ability to sustain that encoding without fracture—both at home (where “reunification” is a core legitimacy theme) and in the way the claim is presented abroad. Institutional continuity is at stake in the sense that the party–state’s authority to speak for “one China” and to manage the narrative of humiliation and restoration is part of its legitimating grammar. If narrative control were to fragment—for example, if the claim were publicly downgraded or abandoned by a rival centre of authority—the legitimacy cost would be structural, not merely tactical. The tension is that what one side treats as restoration of continuity, the other encodes as absorption or conquest; that divergence is not resolved by the analysis, only made visible.

**Paragraph B — Power distribution and structural constraint**

The Taiwan Strait is a maritime chokepoint where relative military capacity, geography, and alliance commitments set the feasible set of outcomes. China’s incentive is to deny external military support for permanent separation and to make the cost of defending the status quo rise over time; the United States and regional allies have an incentive to preserve credible deterrence and to keep the balance such that unilateral change by force is costly. Force ratios, basing, and the ability to sustain operations across the strait (and to control escalation) are the structural variables. Geography favours the side that can project and sustain force across the water and hold key nodes; historical precedent suggests that loss of the decisive corridor or node can remove the linchpin for the defender. The structural constraint on China is that escalation can tip into a domain where the United States or a coalition has superior reach or staying power; the structural constraint on the United States is that extended deterrence depends on credibility and on the defender’s willingness to bear cost. Neither side can fully control the other’s choices; the outcome depends on relative degradation of capability and resolve over time.

**Paragraph C — Leadership liability and mechanism**

Who is exposed if the current policy fails—or if it succeeds at high cost—shapes how much risk leaders can take. On the mainland side, the commitment to “reunification” is publicly entrenched; reversal or open-ended accommodation that is read as abandonment would create defection incentives within the elite and could be framed as a loss of mandate. On the Taiwan side, the exposure runs the other way: moves that look like acquiescence to absorption can be punished domestically, while moves that look like permanent separation can trigger a response that the island may not be able to withstand. Jurisdiction is contested—who has the right to decide the island’s status—and that contest is not merely legal but political: whoever is seen to “give away” the claim or the territory bears the liability. Irreversibility cuts both ways: a military outcome (whether conquest or failed assault) creates facts that cannot be undone; a diplomatic outcome that is read as surrender on either side may also be hard to reverse in domestic politics. The mechanism question is who can credibly commit to what, and who pays the price if the commitment is tested or abandoned.

## II. SELF-CHECK

- **Content-based names only:** Paragraph A is labelled by content (legitimacy and institutional continuity); B by content (power distribution and structural constraint); C by content (leadership liability and mechanism). No “Mercouris,” “Mearsheimer,” “Barnes,” “MIND,” or other system-internal terms appear in the block.
- **Professional register:** Language is analytical and external-facing; suitable for a decision-maker who has not seen CMC governance.
- **Tensions preserved:** A emphasises encoding and narrative; B emphasises force ratios and structural incentives; C emphasises who is exposed and irreversibility. The three do not collapse into a single verdict. The note in A—“what one side treats as restoration, the other encodes as absorption”—is left unresolved. B and C each add a different cut (structure vs liability) without reconciling them.
- **Reader usability:** A reader can use the three paragraphs to see (1) how legitimacy and narrative frame the issue, (2) how structure and geography constrain options, and (3) how liability and mechanism affect who can move and at what cost. No knowledge of MEMs, RLLs, or options menus is required.

## III. USE IN CIV–STATE–CHINA

This block is a **template** for Section III (Strategic Position — Three Perspectives) or for any short “strategic position re: [topic]” note. When the STATE file is created, the same structure applies: three paragraphs per major topic, each named by the perspective’s content, with tensions preserved and no internal vocabulary. The topic here (Taiwan) can be replaced by another (e.g. internal stability, exit-building, compute sovereignty) while keeping the three-perspective format.
