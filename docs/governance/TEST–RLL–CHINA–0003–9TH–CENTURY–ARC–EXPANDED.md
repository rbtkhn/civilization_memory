# Test: RLL–CHINA–0003 Against 9th-Century Example (ARC-Expanded)

**RLL under test:** RLL–CHINA–0003 (CANDIDATE) — cession–return–legitimacy pattern.  
**Case:** Tang court reconstitution of central authority under Emperor Xianzong (805–820)—loss of effective control to fanzhen (military governors) after An Lushan (755–763), then partial “return” of provinces to central authority.  
**Scope:** MEM corpus + full ARC source base (CIV–ARC–CHINA v3.0).

## I. SOURCES CONSULTED

### MEM corpus (primary)
- **MEM–CHINA–DYNASTY–TANG** (618–907): An Lushan Rebellion (755–763) as decisive shock; “自此之后，唐不复盛。” (From this point onward, Tang never fully recovered.); military decentralization; fiscal exhaustion; rise of regional warlords (藩镇割据); court ritual continued as real power waned; provincial autonomy became entrenched; central authority hollowed; “Expansion reinforces legitimacy only while administration scales with it”; “Military decentralization is difficult to reverse once normalized.”

### ARC-listed sources (CIV–ARC–CHINA v3.0)

| ARC-T        | Author / Work | Use in test |
|--------------|----------------|-------------|
| ARC-T-MODERN | **Cambridge History of China** (Fairbank general editor; Twitchett ed. for Tang volume) | Peterson, “Court and province in mid- and late T'ang” (Ch. 8); An Lushan as turning point; court–province dynamics through 9th c. |

### Cambridge History of China (ARC)

- **C. A. Peterson**, “Court and province in mid- and late T'ang” (CHoC, Vol. 3, 1979; Denis Twitchett ed.): The “powerful decentralized provincial order which emerged in China after the middle of the eighth century was a direct result of the An Lu-shan rebellion of 755–63. After the founding itself, the rebellion is without doubt the most significant event in the history of the dynasty. It **transformed a centralized, rich, stable and far-flung empire into a struggling, insecure and divided one**. It has long been treated by historians as a turning-point in T'ang history; in recent decades it has even been treated as a major turning point in Chinese history as a whole.”
- **Peterson** (in *Perspectives on the T'ang*, Twitchett & Wright eds., New Haven 1973): “**The restoration completed: Hsien-tsung and the provinces**”—canonical formulation of Xianzong’s reign as restoration of central control. (Volume cited in CHoC Ch. 8 references.)

### Supplementary (scholarship; not in ARC list)

- Xianzong (805–820): campaigns against fanzhen (Chengde, Weibo, Huaixi); Huaixi campaign 815–817; Chengde’s Wang Chengzong submitted (surrendered prefectures, sent sons as hostages); central authority reasserted over multiple fanzhen; 48 fanzhen still existed at Xianzong’s death (820)—partial restoration, not full reversal.
- “Dynastic revival and political transformation” (Peterson-related scholarship) for Xianzong’s reign.

## II. RLL–CHINA–0003 APPLIED WITH ARC SOURCES

### 1. Activation trigger

RLL applies to “territorial cession, handover, SEZ as **reconstitution**, or humiliation/recovery geography.” The 9th-century case is **reconstitution of central authority over territory**: effective control over provinces was lost to fanzhen (post–An Lushan); Xianzong’s reign partially “returned” that control through campaigns and submissions. No treaty cession of land; the “loss” is erosion of central jurisdiction; the “return” is reassertion of court authority over provinces. **ARC confirmation:** Peterson (CHoC) frames the rebellion as having “transformed” the empire into “struggling, insecure and divided”; Peterson’s chapter “The restoration completed: Hsien-tsung and the provinces” explicitly frames Xianzong’s reign as **restoration** of central authority. So the RLL’s reconstitution/return limb is activated and supported by ARC.

### 2. Pattern: “Legitimacy turns on who lost, who regained, who overreached”

**Who lost (central court, pre-Xianzong)**  
- **MEM:** After An Lushan, “Tang never fully recovered”; military decentralization; “rise of regional warlords (藩镇割据)”; “provincial autonomy became entrenched”; “central authority hollowed.”  
- **ARC (Peterson, CHoC):** An Lushan “transformed a centralized, rich, stable and far-flung empire into a **struggling, insecure and divided** one”; “powerful decentralized provincial order” emerged; “most significant event in the history of the dynasty” after the founding.  
**Conclusion:** MEM and ARC agree: the centre lost effective control over much of the realm; legitimacy of the court was strained by loss of monopoly on force and revenue.

**Who regained (court under Xianzong)**  
- **MEM:** Tang MEM does not name Xianzong; it encodes the *pattern*—“military decentralization is difficult to reverse once normalized”—implying that reversal was possible only in part or for a time.  
- **ARC (Peterson):** “The **restoration completed**: Hsien-tsung and the provinces”; Xianzong reasserted central authority over multiple fanzhen (Chengde submitted; Huaixi defeated 815–817).  
- **Supplementary:** Submission of Chengde (prefectures surrendered, sons as hostages); “restoration of central control”; 48 fanzhen still existed at 820—restoration partial but real.  
**Conclusion:** The court under Xianzong is encoded as the agent of “return”—reconstitution of legitimate central authority over territory that had slipped to governors.

**Who overreached (defiant fanzhen)**  
- **MEM:** “Rise of regional warlords”; “provincial autonomy became entrenched”—those who had taken de facto control and then resisted the centre.  
- **ARC:** Peterson’s “Court and province” and “Regional defense against central power: the Huai-hsi campaign of 815–817” (Chinese ways in warfare) frame fanzhen as defending regional power against the centre; those that submitted or were defeated encode “overreach” that was rolled back.  
**Conclusion:** Fanzhen that had defied the court and were then forced to submit (or defeated) fit “who overreached”—gains that proved unstable when the centre reasserted itself.

### 3. “One geography, multiple encodings”

The same realm (Tang empire, especially north and northeast) holds two encodings:  
- **Court encoding:** Legitimate centre that had “lost” control and then “restored” it under Xianzong; restoration as reassertion of mandate and order.  
- **Fanzhen encoding:** Regional autonomy that had filled the vacuum after An Lushan and was then partially reversed by Xianzong’s campaigns and submissions.  
**ARC:** Peterson’s “restoration completed” and “court and province” frame the same geography under these two perspectives; CHoC treats the period as court–province contest. No requirement to resolve the tension; RLL satisfied.

### 4. Three derivations (with ARC)

- **Mercouris:** Legitimacy encoding; recovery as reconstitution; institutional continuity across loss and return. **Fit:** Court legitimacy rested on reasserting authority; Xianzong’s restoration was conditional (partial, and later emperors lost ground again); institutional continuity—court ritual and Tang law continued—across the loss and partial return.  
- **Mearsheimer:** Structural incentive to reclaim; gain can prove unstable when legitimacy gap follows. **Fit:** Court had a structural incentive to reclaim revenue and military control; fanzhen gains proved unstable when the centre mobilized effectively (Xianzong’s campaigns).  
- **Barnes:** Liability when return fails or is contested; irreversibility. **Fit:** Fanzhen that submitted bore the “liability” of having defied the centre (sons as hostages, prefectures surrendered); what was irreversible was the *pattern* of decentralization—48 fanzhen remained at 820, and later Tang never fully reversed it (MEM: “never fully recovered”).

### 5. MEM vs ARC: consistency and nuance

- **No contradiction:** MEM’s “Tang never fully recovered,” “military decentralization,” “provincial autonomy entrenched” is consistent with ARC’s “struggling, insecure and divided” empire and with a *partial* restoration under Xianzong (restoration “completed” in Peterson’s title refers to Xianzong’s achievement, not to a full return to pre–An Lushan centralization).  
- **ARC adds:** (1) Peterson’s explicit “**restoration** completed: Hsien-tsung and the provinces” as canonical framing; (2) An Lushan as “most significant event … after the founding” and “turning point in Chinese history as a whole”; (3) court–province as the axis of 9th-century politics.  
- **Scope:** The “territory” in this case is **authority/jurisdiction** over provinces, not ceded land. RLL’s “reconstitution” limb covers this: effective control was lost, then partially returned; legitimacy turned on who held that control.

## III. LIMIT OF TEST

The 9th-century case does not exercise **treaty cession** or **handover** of land. It exercises **reconstitution of central authority** over territory that had slipped from court control—a “return” of jurisdiction and effective power rather than of ceded territory. The RLL’s “cession, return, **or** reconstitution” is satisfied on the reconstitution and return (of authority) limbs. Comparison with 14th c.: both are reconstitution without cession; 14th c. = dynastic replacement (Yuan → Ming); 9th c. = same dynasty reasserting centre over periphery. RLL holds for both.

## IV. VERDICT

**RLL–CHINA–0003 holds** when tested against the 9th-century example (Tang Xianzong, 805–820; court–fanzhen; partial restoration of central authority) **with the full ARC source base**. MEM (Tang decline, fanzhen, “never fully recovered”) and ARC (Cambridge History—Peterson, “Court and province in mid- and late T'ang”; “The restoration completed: Hsien-tsung and the provinces”) agree on: (1) centre as having “lost” effective control after An Lushan, (2) Xianzong as agent of “return”/restoration of central authority, (3) legitimacy and reconstitution as the stakes, (4) one geography (empire) with two encodings (court vs fanzhen). No ARC source contradicts the RLL. The test confirms that RLL–CHINA–0003 applies to **reconstitution of authority over territory** (not only to cession of land or dynastic replacement)—i.e. to “return” of jurisdiction and control when the centre reasserts itself over regional power.
