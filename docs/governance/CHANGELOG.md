00007. STATE TEMPLATE — ACCOMMODATION/REVERSAL OPTION IN DECISION POINTS (12 FEB 2026)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Date: 2026-02-12
Type: GOVERNANCE (CIV–STATE–TEMPLATE / CURSOR RULE)

CHANGES:
• CIV–STATE–TEMPLATE v3.2 → v3.3: Decision Points (X-B) step 8 now requires
  that when the decision involves a commitment (alliance, arms, presence,
  confrontation), the option set MUST include at least one option at the
  accommodation/reversal end of the spectrum, with one-line documentation
  (duty of competence; Doctrine 03).
• Section I (Duty of competence clarification): added explicit requirement
  for decision-point option sets to include accommodation/reversal when
  applicable; reference to X-B step 8.
• Section X (Self-check): new checklist item for accommodation/reversal
  option when Decision Points involve a commitment.
• cmc-state-mem-grounding.mdc: new self-check bullet for Decision Points
  accommodation/reversal option.

RATIONALE:
STATE–AMERICA Taiwan session omitted the "one-China return, stop arms,
peace with China" option in the first pass; user identified this as a
systemic bias (commitment-weighted default). American doctrine (03) and
duty of competence already permit exit/retrenchment; the change makes
that operational in option generation so accommodation is included in
the first pass, not only when the user requests it.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
00006. MEARSHEIMER COGNITIVE-LINGUISTIC AUDIT (12 FEB 2026)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Date: 2026-02-12
Type: GOVERNANCE (MIND / CURSOR RULE / AUDIT)

CHANGES:
• RUN–REPORT–AUDIT–MEARSHEIMER–COGNITIVE–LINGUISTIC–2026-02-12 created (audit of
  Mearsheimer × Daniel Davis Deep Dive, February 2026 — Netanyahu meeting, Iran,
  Ukraine, Kallas/Bremmer, Keane).
• cmc-mearsheimer-voice.mdc: transcript-derived markers added (interview response
  openers: "Well, just a couple points. One,... The second point I'd make...",
  "Look, this is very simple," "that's my bottom line on this," "the $64,000
  question"; transitions "switching gears," "Your point's right on the money";
  demand for mechanism "Please explain to me how this is going to be done,"
  "plausible story," "you never get any"; dismissal "This is nonsense," "detached
  from reality," "blowing smoke," "pipe dream," "Is this guy serious?"; narrative
  lock-in "nobody wants to be the first mover," "he'd be fired," public vs
  private; moderate hedging "My sense is," "it is hard for me to see how"; version
  reference v3.3).
• CIV–MIND–MEARSHEIMER v3.2 → v3.3: UPGRADE NOTE for 12 Feb 2026 transcript; new
  markers in V.A (interview openers), V.C (topic shift), V.D (hedging), V.I
  (bottom line), V.K (dismissal/reality-detachment), V.N (I would note, by the
  way); new V.O (Demand for mechanism / plausible story), V.P (Narrative lock-in
  / public vs private).
• Source Material updated to include Davis Deep Dive February 2026.

ORIGIN:
User-requested cognitive-linguistic authenticity audit of MIND–MEARSHEIMER using
Daniel Davis Deep Dive transcript (Feb 2026); user requested application of
recommended changes.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
00005. MERCOURIS COGNITIVE-LINGUISTIC AUDIT (12 FEB 2026)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Date: 2026-02-12
Type: GOVERNANCE (MIND / CURSOR RULE / AUDIT)

CHANGES:
• RUN–REPORT–AUDIT–MERCOURIS–COGNITIVE–LINGUISTIC–2026-02-12 created (audit of
  Mercouris program transcript 12 Feb 2026 — Middle East/Iran, Ukraine, Lavrov,
  Epstein/Bondi, oil/Hormuz, F-35/gallium).
• cmc-mercouris-voice.mdc: transcript-derived markers added (program opener;
  "Just saying," "For the record," "I have to say," "My key point is, however";
  epistemic variants "I believe—I may be wrong—but I believe that...", "To my
  mind," "I get the impression," "I would have thought that...", "to me that
  sounds..."; recursive/returning "To repeat again," "I go back to...", "What I do
  want to turn attention to is..."; deferral "that's another story. I'm not going
  to get into..."; hedged assessment "I find [X] completely incredible"; attribution
  "[claim]—which does not come from this source, by the way"; self-correction
  "[X]—no, wait, [Y]; I meant..."; non-closure "We have to be careful when
  discussing all of this," "we can't be sure that we aren't seeing..."; self-check
  IMAGINE bullet; reference to audit).
• CIV–MIND–MERCOURIS v3.2 → v3.3: UPGRADE NOTE for 12 Feb 2026 transcript; new
  markers added to III.A (program opener, returning pivots, self-correction,
  "that's another story"), III.B (epistemic hedging, hedged assessment), III.C
  (source qualification, "My key point is, however," scope/epistemic caution),
  III.L (IMAGINE current-events program style: date/topic + difficulty and/or
  attribution; scope limits and source qualification central).
• cmc-mercouris-voice.mdc: version reference updated to CIV–MIND–MERCOURIS v3.3;
  current-events program sub-note added under mode-specific voice.

ORIGIN:
User-requested cognitive-linguistic authenticity audit of MIND–MERCOURIS using
12 Feb 2026 program transcript; user approved all follow-on recommendations
(sync MIND profile, CHANGELOG, rule version, current-events sub-note).

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
00004. GOVERNANCE AND TEMPLATE VERSION ALIGNMENT TO v3.2
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Date: 2026-02-11
Type: VERSION (ALIGNMENT)

CHANGES:
• All governance and template files with declared version < 3.2
  upgraded to v3.2 for alignment with CMC 3.2.
• Governance: CHANGELOG, COMPLIANCE–REGISTRY, CIV–SCHOLAR–PRUNING–PROTOCOL,
  NAMESPACE–CLARIFICATION, SESSION–LEDGER, and all PROPOSAL–* files.
• Templates: CIV–STATE–TEMPLATE (v1.12→v3.2), CIV–CORE–TEMPLATE, CIV–INDEX–TEMPLATE,
  CIV–ARC–TEMPLATE, CIV–ARC–LEDGER–TEMPLATE, CIV–DOCTRINE–TEMPLATE, CIV–CEO–TEMPLATE,
  CIV–MEM–TEMPLATE, CIV–SCHOLAR–TEMPLATE, CIV–SCHOLAR–PROTOCOL, CIV–MIND–TEMPLATE,
  CIV–MIND–MERCOURIS, CIV–MIND–MEARSHEIMER, CIV–MIND–BARNES, and EXAMPLE–MEM–* files.
• CIV–SCHOLAR–PRUNING–PROTOCOL compatibility updated to CIV–MEM–CORE v3.2 ·
  CIV–SCHOLAR–TEMPLATE v3.2.
• END OF FILE markers and Version: lines updated to 3.2 in all upgraded files.

ORIGIN:
User requested upgrade of all governance and template files with version < 3.2.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
00003. HARVEST — EXCLUSIVE GATE FOR STATE → SCHOLAR LEARN
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Date: 2026-02-11
Type: PROCEDURAL (STATE–SCHOLAR TRANSFER)

CHANGES:
• Only **"harvest"** or **"harvest session"** command in STATE mode
  may transfer information into SCHOLAR (learn mode). No other
  mechanism permitted.
• CIV–STATE–TEMPLATE v1.11 → v1.12: Section XIV-B (Harvest Protocol)
  added with trigger, procedure (identify → propose → approve →
  record), and cursor-rule reference. Section XII (Directionality)
  updated to state harvest as exclusive gate.
• New cursor rule: cmc-state-scholar-harvest.mdc (trigger, procedure,
  no automatic harvest).
• cmc-state-scholar-sync.mdc: "One-Way Only" qualified — transfer
  into Scholar only via harvest.
• CMC–BOOTSTRAP: SYNC paragraph updated to add Harvest (only way
  STATE → Scholar learn).
• CIV–STATE–RUSSIA, CIV–SCHOLAR–RUSSIA: foundational perspective
  text updated to cite harvest as sole transfer path.

ORIGIN:
User specified that only "harvest" / "harvest session" command in
STATE mode can transfer information into Scholar learn mode.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
00002. COGNITIVE EXOSKELETON — DESIGN OBJECTIVE AND CONSTRAINTS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Date: 2026-02-11
Type: GOVERNANCE (STATE PURPOSE, TERMINOLOGY)

CHANGES:
• CIV–STATE–TEMPLATE v1.10 → v1.11. Section I (PURPOSE & AUTHORITY)
  now includes subsection "COGNITIVE EXOSKELETON: DESIGN OBJECTIVE
  AND CONSTRAINTS": beneficiary (principal and/or advisory
  institution), design objectives (blind-spot reduction, frame
  transparency, temporal compression), anti-goals (no oracle, no
  hiding contradiction, no frame-independent truth, no single-point
  dependency), and duty-of-competence clarification (completeness
  across three perspectives, not exhaustive option list).
• TERMINOLOGY–REGISTRY: CIV–STATE entry updated to state that the
  exoskeleton "extends the principal's cognitive reach (options,
  precedent, disconfirming evidence) without substituting for
  judgment."

ORIGIN:
User asked for ways to improve the "cognitive exoskeleton for head
of state" design objective. System proposed seven sharpenings;
user approved drafting. Implemented in template Section I and
registry.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
00001. CORE / STATE / SCHOLAR RE-ANCHOR TOGETHER (ENTITY SWITCH)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Date: 2026-02-11
Type: PROCEDURAL (ENTITY FOCUS, LOAD RULES)

CHANGES:
• CORE, STATE, and SCHOLAR re-anchor together on civilization/entity
  switch. When the entity under analysis changes, the previous entity's
  CIV–CORE, CIV–STATE, and CIV–SCHOLAR cease to govern; load the new
  entity's CORE and (per mode) STATE file or SCHOLAR file as needed.
• Load per mode: STATE mode → CORE + STATE file + MEMs; SCHOLAR mode →
  CORE + SCHOLAR file + MEMs as needed. No automatic load of all three
  file types every time.
• Propagated to: CMC–BOOTSTRAP (STATE CORE LOAD), cmc-state-mem-grounding,
  cmc-scholar-mode, CIV–STATE–TEMPLATE (Section I entity focus),
  CIV–SCHOLAR–TEMPLATE (XIII entity focus), CIV–SCHOLAR–PROTOCOL (header),
  CIV–MEM–CORE (Section III after file-type list), CIV–CORE–TEMPLATE (Section I).

ORIGIN:
User asked whether SCHOLAR, STATE, and CORE should always load/unload
together. Design: same entity anchors all three; on switch all three
re-anchor; load only what the current mode needs.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
00000. GATED SPIRAL AWARENESS RULE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Date: 2026-02-11
Type: PROCEDURAL SAFEGUARD (EPISTEMIC)

CHANGES:
• New cursor rule: cmc-gated-spiral-awareness.mdc
  Encodes system self-awareness of the recursive loop between DOCTRINE
  (lens), LEARN/STATE (finding), and WRITE (modify DOCTRINE). The loop
  is by design; the user checkpoint is the gate; ARC is outside the
  loop. Rule includes self-awareness obligation: when proposing doctrine
  modifications, the system must note which doctrines governed the
  analysis that produced the finding, and whether the finding is
  frame-consistent (higher confirmation-bias risk) or frame-challenging.

ORIGIN:
Session traversed the full loop in one sitting: STATE–RUSSIA doctrine
check (v3.2 → v3.3) → SCHOLAR LEARN (DOCTRINE 06 through Nicholas II,
Rome, Ottoman Empire) → SCHOLAR WRITE (DOCTRINE 07 encoded, six MEMs
enhanced, v3.3 → v3.4). User identified the recursive architecture;
system analysed it; both concluded: gated spiral, not vicious circle.
The residual risk — that the lens shapes the learning and the learning
shapes the lens — is inherent and cannot be fully eliminated, only
mitigated through transparency and existing safeguards.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
0000. CIV–DOCTRINE–RUSSIA v3.4 — DOCTRINE 07 (CORRECTION MECHANISM ABSENCE)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Date: 2026-02-11
Type: CONTENT UPDATE (ADDITIVE)

CHANGES:
• CIV–DOCTRINE–RUSSIA upgraded from v3.3 to v3.4.
• DOCTRINE 07 (CORRECTION MECHANISM ABSENCE): New doctrine. Encodes the
  finding that Russian autocracy lacks an institutionalised mechanism for
  correcting sovereign dysfunction from within the elite. Buffers
  (DOCTRINE 02) absorb external shocks but cannot remove or replace a
  ruler whose personal behaviour degrades the system. Cross-civilisational
  comparative evidence: Rome's Praetorian correction (Caligula, ad hoc,
  succeeded), Ottoman Janissary corrections (institutionalised, succeeded
  repeatedly 1622–1807), Russia (improvised, failed — Nicholas II 1917).

ORIGIN:
SCHOLAR LEARN session traced DOCTRINE 06 (Fiscal-Personalist Incoherence)
through Nicholas II's Duma oscillation (1905–1917), then compared elite
self-policing across three civilisations (Rome, Ottoman, Russia). The
session found that DOCTRINE 02's buffer function is one-directional —
it addresses external shocks but not sovereign-generated dysfunction. The
correction-mechanism absence explains why Russian fiscal-personalist
incoherence is terminal rather than recoverable: correction arrives only
after institutional depth is already exhausted.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
000. CIV–DOCTRINE–RUSSIA v3.3 — DOCTRINE 02/04 REFINEMENT + DOCTRINE 06
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Date: 2026-02-11
Type: CONTENT UPDATE (ADDITIVE)

CHANGES:
• CIV–DOCTRINE–RUSSIA upgraded from v3.2 to v3.3.
• DOCTRINE 02 (BUFFERED AUTOCRACY): Added decision-quality distortion
  mechanism to Operational Meaning — unbuffered personalism causes
  decisions to optimise for the leader's survival horizon. Added Hard
  Constraint: elimination of competing advisory voices degrades decision
  quality. Source: MEM–RUSSIA–PANIN, CIV–STATE–RUSSIA v1.7.
• DOCTRINE 04 (ELITE CAPACITY BOUND): Added purge-redistribution failure
  mode to Operational Meaning — dismantling an institutional bloc and
  redistributing rents produces factional competition, not cohesion,
  even under active survival framing. Added Hard Constraint: purge-
  redistribution without institutional reabsorption triggers factional
  competition. Source: ARC-sourced doctrine check Feb 2026; Carnegie
  Politika (ARC E/RESEARCH); Meduza (ARC E/NEWS).
• DOCTRINE 06 (FISCAL-PERSONALIST INCOHERENCE): New doctrine. Captures
  the interaction between DOCTRINE 02 and DOCTRINE 05 — fiscal pressure
  demands settlement while personalist structure resists it, producing
  diplomatic engagement without binding commitment. Source: CIV–STATE–
  RUSSIA v1.7 Section VII; ARC-sourced doctrine check Feb 2026.

ORIGIN:
ARC-sourced doctrine check session (February 2026) revealed three gaps
between existing doctrine definitions and analytical findings derived
from multi-source evidence. All changes are additive refinements or a
new doctrine — no definitions replaced, no doctrines deleted, no
acceptance statuses changed. Consistent with "Supersession is additive
only" rule.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
00. ARC SOURCE COVERAGE RULE + STATE-RUSSIA v1.7
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Date: 2026-02-11
Type: PROCEDURAL SAFEGUARD + CONTENT UPDATE

CHANGES:
• New cursor rule: cmc-arc-source-coverage.mdc
  Requires consultation of multiple ARC source categories
  before presenting evidence in STATE mode or doctrine checks.
  Prevents one-sided citation of Western specialist sources
  without consulting entity's own official/institutional data.
• CIV–STATE–RUSSIA upgraded to v1.7:
  - Evidence Update 5 added to Option A (Endurance Through
    Attrition) with ARC-sourced findings and source contradiction
    on replacement-burn constraint
  - Evidence Update 2 added to Option B (Negotiated Settlement)
    with DOCTRINE 05/02 interaction finding and June projection
  - New pattern added to Section VII: Doctrine Interaction —
    Fiscal vs Personalist Incoherence
  - Stability Indicator (Elite cohesion) updated with ARC-sourced
    purge evidence from Carnegie and Meduza
  - Endurance pattern in Section VII corrected with source
    contradiction and ARC attribution

ORIGIN:
Doctrine check session found the system cited Western specialist
estimates as settled fact without consulting Russian official
sources (TASS, Kremlin, CBR). Violated the source contradiction
rule built into CIV–STATE–TEMPLATE. Corrected assessment
consulted ARC sources across all categories and preserved
contradictions where sources disagreed.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
0. NEGATIVE CLAIM CORPUS CHECK
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Date: 2026-02-11
Type: PROCEDURAL SAFEGUARD

CHANGES:
• New cursor rule: cmc-negative-claim-check.mdc
• Requires MEM corpus search before asserting that a
  civilisation lacks a quality, trait, tradition, or pattern
• Applies to all analytical modes (SCHOLAR, STATE)
• Specific protection against divergence analysis bias:
  contrast-seeking suppresses counter-evidence

ORIGIN:
Session finding — divergence analysis of STATE-RUSSIA and
STATE-GERMANY claimed "Russia's civilisational grammar has
no category for voluntary self-restraint as strength." The
MEM corpus contained four strong counter-examples (Panin,
Kutuzov, Vienna, Nevsky) that were not consulted. Same bias
suppressed German assertiveness evidence (Bismarck, Teutonic
Order, Hanseatic League). Washington (MEM-ANGLIA-WASHINGTON)
was also missed — the strongest case of personal restraint
becoming institutional norm.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
I. PURPOSE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This file consolidates governance change history.

Previously, upgrade notes were embedded in every governance file,
accumulating hundreds of lines of version history across the repository.

Under CMC 3.1 Version Decoupling:
• Governance changes are logged HERE
• Individual files no longer contain upgrade notes
• History is centralized and searchable

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  CIV–STATE–TEMPLATE, cmc-state-mem-grounding
• ~148 content replacements across 24 files (governance,
  templates, cursor rules, MIND files, content files)
• TERMINOLOGY–REGISTRY entry updated with new description

EXCLUSIONS:
• ANGLIA MEM files using "counsel" as historical term
  (MEM–ANGLIA–LAW–PARLIAMENT, MEM–ANGLIA–ELIZABETH–I)
  were not modified

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. CMC 3.2 — THREE-MODE ARCHITECTURE EDITION

  TRI-FRAME → three-perspective analysis,
  POST-BARNES → after liability analysis,
  CCM → cross-civilizational misperception
• Barnes reclassified: TERTIARY CATALYST →
  LIABILITY/MECHANISM PERSPECTIVE

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II.C CMC 3.1 — OGE SIMPLIFICATION (MODIFIED)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Date: 2026-02-04
Type: STRUCTURAL
CORE Version: CIV–MEM–CORE v3.1

DECISION: MODIFY — Keep 8-slot structure, remove state tracking

RATIONALE:
The 8-slot design intentionally surfaces system capabilities. Each slot
teaches users what the system can do. This pedagogical value was preserved.

CHANGES:
• Slots remain fixed (A=Mercouris always, B=Mearsheimer always, etc.)
• Removed POST-BARNES semantic shift (slots no longer change meaning)
• Removed state tracking of which MIND spoke last
• Increased label length to 10-20 words (clearer than 6-10)
• Added contextual notes instead of slot shifts

PRESERVED:
• 8 options (A–H) as capability menu
• Fixed slot assignments for all modes
• Required OGE after every substantive turn

REMOVED:
• POST-BARNES mandatory M/M response options
• Semantic shift of A and B after Barnes
• State tracking across turns

IMPLEMENTATION:
• PROPOSAL–OGE–SIMPLIFICATION.md v1.1 (modified acceptance)
• cmc-oge-enforcement.mdc — Updated
• cmc-tri-frame-protocol.mdc — Updated
• cmc-scholar-mode.mdc — Updated

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

CHANGES:
• Created CONCEPT–INDEX.md with ~40 analytical concepts
• Added optional CONCEPTS section to CIV–MEM–TEMPLATE (XXV.E)
• Added concepts and mem_concepts tables to database schema
• Concepts organized by frame: Mearsheimer, Mercouris, Barnes, Cross-cutting
• OGE can leverage concept similarity for traversal options

RATIONALE:
• Enable semantic discovery across 1,000+ files
• Cross-civ pattern recognition via shared concepts
• Smarter OGE options based on conceptual similarity
• Foundation for future semantic search

IMPLEMENTATION:
• PROPOSAL–CONCEPT–INDEX.md (accepted)

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. CMC 3.0 — CONSOLIDATION EDITION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Date: 2026-02-02
Type: ALIGNMENT
