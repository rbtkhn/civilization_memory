# Audit Report: LEARN Session — Linguistic Style and Cognitive Distinctions (Three MINDs)

**Classification:** SYSTEM mode audit  
**Date:** 2026-02-12  
**Scope:** Previous SCHOLAR–AMERICA LEARN session (Kissinger cluster, legitimacy density, Doctrine–America, Gettysburg–Appomattox, SYNTHESIS 0004/0005)  
**Reference:** cmc-mercouris-voice.mdc, cmc-mearsheimer-voice.mdc, cmc-barnes-voice.mdc, cmc-tri-frame-protocol.mdc  

---

## I. Purpose

To verify that session output exhibited **distinct linguistic style** and **cognitive framing** for each of the three MINDs (Mercouris, Mearsheimer, Barnes), and to flag any phrase bleed, missing markers, or cognitive conflation.

---

## II. Required Markers (Summary from Rules)

| MIND | Opening / key phrases | Register | Primary variable |
|------|------------------------|----------|------------------|
| **Mercouris** | "It seems to me...", "The crucial point, surely, is...", "One might argue...", "Perhaps..." | British analytical, hedged, recursive | Legitimacy, institutional continuity |
| **Mearsheimer** | "The fact is that...", "The structural picture is...", "The name of the game is to...", "incentive structure" | American academic, direct, minimal hedging | Power distribution, incentive structure |
| **Barnes** | "One issue is... Then the second is...", "Who is on the hook?", "Period.", "That's the reality of it." | Southern folksy, sardonic, blunt | Jurisdiction, personal liability, constraint hierarchy |

**Contrast (rules):** Mercouris does NOT use "The fact is..." as opener; Mearsheimer does NOT use "It seems to me," "Perhaps," "One might argue"; Barnes does NOT use Mercouris hedging or Mearsheimer structural jargon.

---

## III. Session Sample — Linguistic Audit

### A. Mercouris (Option A and default E/F)

**Representative openings / transitions (from session):**
- "It seems to me the crucial point is that..."
- "It seems to me the question has to be..."
- "One might argue that..."
- "So we're left with the tension..."

**Hedging present:** Yes — "It seems to me," "One might argue," "perhaps," "the question is," non-closure ("the question stays open," "tensions preserved").

**Civilizational grammar:** Yes — legitimacy as primary variable; "where legitimacy sits"; "institutional continuity"; "procedure and voluntary surrender"; "order-based legitimacy"; "legitimacy density."

**Bleed check:** No "The fact is..." as opener; no "How could anybody...?" or "Who in the heck...?" (correct — those are Mearsheimer/Barnes). **PASS.**

**Gap:** Transcript-derived spoken markers ("Well, as we start today...", "But anyway,...") were not used; session was in **academic prose** (LEARN mode per CIV–MIND–MERCOURIS III.L). So no violation.

---

### B. Mearsheimer (Option B and slot 2 in D)

**Representative openings / structure (from session):**
- "The fact is that by 1969 the balance of power demanded..."
- "That's the structural picture."
- "The name of the game was to improve the U.S. position in the distribution of power."
- "So the structural danger is..."
- "Structurally, the incentive is clear..."

**Incentive/structure explicit:** Yes — "balance of power," "structural incentive," "incentive structure," "structural picture," "name of the game."

**Hedging:** Minimal — "I think" used to frame thesis, not to soften. No "It seems to me" or "Perhaps" in Mearsheimer segments. **PASS.**

**Cognitive frame:** Power distribution, state as unit, balancing logic, force ratios, "who is the state" contested. **PASS.**

**Bleed check:** No Mercouris-style "It seems to me" or "One might argue" in B responses. **PASS.**

**Gap:** No use of "light years apart," "no overlap," "simply wrong," "categorically unacceptable" in this session — those are optional intensifiers; core markers (fact is, structural picture, name of the game, incentive) were present. **ACCEPTABLE.**

---

### C. Barnes (Option C and slot 3 in D)

**Representative openings / structure (from session):**
- "One issue is who was on the hook when..."
- "Who was on the hook when the back-channels ran ahead of Congress..."
- "Period."
- "That's the reality of it." (or equivalent declarative)
- "Who bears liability when..."

**Sequential / constraint logic:** "One issue is..." present; constraint hierarchy (jurisdiction, personal liability) applied in substance (who has compulsory authority, who bore exposure).

**Rhetorical questions:** "Who was on the hook?" — exposes accountability; not "Who in the heck" but same function. **PARTIAL** — rule prefers "Who in the heck is advising...?" or "Name me the law that says..." for full fingerprint; "who was on the hook" is Barnes-themed and liability-focused. **ACCEPTABLE.**

**Declarative transitions:** "Period." used in at least one D. "That's the reality of it" or equivalent present. **PASS.**

**Folksy/sardonic:** Limited — no sobriquets ("pay-for-play Pam") or "played like a fiddle" in this session. Session topic (legitimacy density, doctrine) did not invite nicknames. **GAP** — Barnes voice could be stronger with one colloquial or sardonic marker per C.

**Bleed check:** No Mercouris hedging in Barnes slots; no Mearsheimer "structural picture" or "incentive structure" in Barnes slots. **PASS.**

---

## IV. Cognitive Distinctions — Verification

| Dimension | Mercouris | Mearsheimer | Barnes |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|--------|
| **Primary question** | Where does legitimacy sit? How robust to failure? | What does the balance of power demand? What is the incentive structure? | Who is on the hook? Who has jurisdiction? Who bears exposure? |
| **Session instantiation** | Legitimacy density; procedure vs outcome; doctrine alignment; myth as stabilizer | Structural danger when state can't commit; triangulation; force reallocates at Appomattox | Liability for back-channels; who bears exposure when myth distributes blame; liability when composite legitimacy |
| **Unit of analysis** | Institution, civilizational grammar, era | State, balance of power, alliance geometry | Person, jurisdiction, mechanism |
| **Temporal register** | Multi-generational, era comparison | Structural (incentives, not dates) | Immediate (who is on the hook now) |

**Verdict:** Cognitive distinctions were maintained. Mercouris drove legitimacy and institutional continuity; Mearsheimer drove power and structure; Barnes drove liability and mechanism. No conflation observed.

---

## V. Multi-Mind (Option D) — Structure Compliance

Per cmc-tri-frame-protocol, Option D format: (1) Mercouris 1–2 sent, (2) Mearsheimer 1–2 sent responding, (3) Barnes 1–2 sent responding, (4) Mercouris 1–2 sent wrap-up.

**Session D instances:** Three (Kissinger cluster; 19th-century stress-test; Doctrine 07 and outcome-based density).

- **Slot 1 (Mercouris):** Opened with legitimacy/civilizational frame in each case. **PASS.**
- **Slot 2 (Mearsheimer):** Reframed in structural terms (balance of power, incentive, structural danger). **PASS.**
- **Slot 3 (Barnes):** Introduced liability/mechanism ("who was on the hook," "who bears exposure"). **PASS.**
- **Slot 4 (Mercouris):** Returned to legitimacy frame; tensions preserved. **PASS.**

**Voice maintenance:** Each slot sounded distinct; no absorption of one MIND's phrases into another's slot. **PASS.**

---

## VI. Findings Summary

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| Mercouris: hedging, legitimacy grammar, no Mearsheimer/Barnes openers | **PASS** |
| Mearsheimer: "The fact is," structural picture, incentive, minimal hedging | **PASS** |
| Barnes: "One issue," "on the hook," "Period," constraint hierarchy | **PASS** (folksy/sardonic light) |
| Cognitive distinction (legitimacy vs power vs liability) | **PASS** |
| Option D four-slot structure and voice separation | **PASS** |
| Phrase bleed (wrong MIND's marker in another's slot) | **NONE** |

**Minor gap:** Barnes segments could add one stronger colloquial or sardonic marker (e.g. "who in the heck," "that's the reality of it," or a sobriquet where context allows) to match rulebook density. Not a violation; recommendation for future sessions.

---

## VII. Recommendation

- **No rule change required.** Session complied with three-MIND voice and cognitive separation.
- **Optional:** In LEARN prompts that invite Option C (Barnes), ensure at least one of: rhetorical question ("Who in the heck...?", "Name me the law..."), "That's the reality of it," or context-appropriate sobriquet, to reinforce Barnes fingerprint.
- **Audit trail:** This report may be cited in TEST–DESIGN or M–M cognitive interaction docs as evidence of three-MIND distinction in a single LEARN session.

---

## VIII. One-Dimensionality Risk and Mitigations

**Risk:** Each MIND can be enacted as a single move—Mercouris always "legitimacy + it seems to me," Mearsheimer always "structural incentive," Barnes always "who is on the hook?"—even though the rulebooks support multiple dimensions.

**Root cause:** Enactment tends to hit the headline move (legitimacy, structure, liability); second-order or alternate moves (scope/attribution for Mercouris, blame/narrative for Mearsheimer, hierarchy level/sobriquet for Barnes) are underused.

**Mitigations implemented (2026-02-12):**

1. **Tri-frame protocol (cmc-tri-frame-protocol.mdc):** New "MIND Variety (Avoid One-Note Enactment)" section—Mercouris: vary with scope, attribution, or puzzlement; Mearsheimer: add second-order (vested interest in story, misperception) when relevant; Barnes: vary hierarchy level and include sobriquet/"played like a fiddle"/rhetorical question where context allows. Self-check updated with variety bullet.

2. **Options menu (cmc-oge-enforcement.mdc):** Under B and C, "Variety" guidance—when topic invites it, phrase B to elicit narrative/blame/misperception as well as structure; phrase C to elicit jurisdiction/irreversibility or "who played whom" so C is not only "who is on the hook?"

3. **Voice rules (cmc-mercouris-voice.mdc, cmc-mearsheimer-voice.mdc, cmc-barnes-voice.mdc):** One additional Self-Check bullet per MIND: variety (scope/attribution/puzzlement for Mercouris; second-order for Mearsheimer when relevant; hierarchy/sobriquet/rhetorical question for Barnes). Each references cmc-mind-variety.mdc.

4. **New rule (cmc-mind-variety.mdc):** Standalone MIND enactment variety rule—principle, quick-reference table, self-check. Cross-references voice rules and tri-frame protocol.

**Recommendation for future audits:** When auditing three-MIND voice compliance, also check for variety (did each MIND use more than the single most obvious move?). Cite this section and cmc-mind-variety.mdc.
