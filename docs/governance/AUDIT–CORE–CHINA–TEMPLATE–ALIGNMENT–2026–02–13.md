## I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

| Criterion              | Result        | Action                                |
|------------------------|---------------|----------------------------------------|
| Section order I–XX     | PASS          | —                                      |
| Header requirements   | PASS (3 gaps) | Update version refs on next edit       |
| Structural immutability| PASS          | —                                      |
| Verdict block         | PASS          | —                                      |
| WORDCOUNT              | PASS          | —                                      |
| Optional post-XX       | PASS          | —                                      |

**Verdict:** CIV–CORE–CHINA is structurally aligned with CIV–CORE–TEMPLATE. All required sections present in correct order. Three version references are stale (Template Version Used, Compatibility, Governed by). Recommend updates on next edit per cmc-version-upgrade-on-edit.

---

## II. CIV–MEM–CORE (RUN)

Audit conducted under current governance (CMC 3.3, CIV–MEM–CORE):

- CORE files are civilization constraint engines; SCHOLAR has zero authority inside CIV–CORE.
- Version rule: content version tracks content changes; governance version is CMC 3.3 (VERSION–MANIFEST).
- Template binding: CIV–CORE–TEMPLATE v3.2 is canonical; CORE instances should declare Template Version Used and Compatibility accordingly for alignment.

**Findings:**
1. Template Version Used: v3.0; canonical template is v3.2. Recommend: `Template Version Used: CIV–CORE–TEMPLATE v3.2`.
2. Compatibility: CMC v3.0 is stale; three-mode architecture (SCHOLAR / STATE / SYSTEM) and CMC 3.3 are current. Recommend: `Compatibility: CIV / MEM / SCHOLAR / STATE Architecture (CMC v3.2+)` or `(CMC v3.3)`.
3. Governed by: CIV–MEM–CORE v3.0; template and manifest use v3.2+. Recommend: `Governed by: CIV–MEM–CORE` or version as per current CIV–MEM–CORE header.

**Post-XX:** None. No optional modules appended. Permitted.

**Note:** Section titles use en-dash and ALL CAPS (e.g. CROSS–CIVILIZATIONAL) vs template hyphenation (Cross-Civilizational); semantic match, no structural violation.

---

## V. STRUCTURAL IMMUTABILITY (TEMPLATE § IV)

- Fixed section ordering: preserved ✓  
- No sections removed ✓  
- Additive-only: no post-XX modules; content within sections is expansion within lock ✓  
- Explicit version lineage (Supersedes v2.0): present ✓  

---

## VI. VERDICT BLOCK & WORDCOUNT (TEMPLATE § VII, XII)

- **Mandatory Verdict Block (XX):** Present; lists MSI, PLS, SOC, AT, IRR, Compute Sovereignty, SAF-CH, GRID-CH, Strategic Classification. ✓  
- **WORDCOUNT:** Declared (~2,800). ✓  

---

## VII. RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **On next edit:**  
   - Set `Template Version Used: CIV–CORE–TEMPLATE v3.2`.  
   - Set `Compatibility: CIV / MEM / SCHOLAR / STATE Architecture (CMC v3.2+)` or `(CMC v3.3)`.  
   - Set `Governed by: CIV–MEM–CORE` (or current CIV–MEM–CORE version if declared in that file).  
   Per cmc-version-upgrade-on-edit, increment content version only if substantive content changes; header-only version ref updates may be done without content version bump if governance permits.
2. No structural changes required; section set and order are compliant.
3. Optional: Add Doctrine Reference line if CIV–DOCTRINE–CHINA exists and mirror binding is desired (see CIV–CORE–AMERICA).

---

## VIII. VERDICT

CIV–CORE–CHINA is **aligned** with CIV–CORE–TEMPLATE v3.2 in structure and section order. Three stale references: Template Version Used (v3.0 → v3.2), Compatibility (CMC v3.0 → CMC v3.2+), Governed by (CIV–MEM–CORE v3.0 → current). Fix on next edit to complete alignment.
