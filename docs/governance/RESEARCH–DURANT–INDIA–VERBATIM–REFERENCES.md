## II. VERBATIM PASSAGES — OUR ORIENTAL HERITAGE (1935)

### A. Foundations of India — continuity and scale (Ch. XIV § I)

**Suggested MEMs:** MEM–INDIA–GEO–INDUS, MEM–INDIA–GEO–GANGES, MEM–INDIA–DYNASTY–MAURYA, MEM–INDIA–DYNASTY–GUPTA, MEM–INDIA–DYNASTY–MUGHAL; any MEM requiring civilizational continuity or “India as intellectual continent.”

> Nothing should more deeply shame the modern student than the recency and inadequacy of his acquaintance with India. Here is a vast peninsula of nearly two million square miles; two-thirds as large as the United States, and twenty times the size of its master, Great Britain; 320,000,000 souls, more than in all North and South America combined, or one-fifth of the population of the earth; an impressive continuity of development and civilization from Mohenjo-daro, 2900 B.C. or earlier, to Gandhi, Raman and Tagore; faiths compassing every stage from barbarous idolatry to the most subtle and spiritual pantheism; philosophers playing a thousand variations on one monistic theme from the Upanishads eight centuries before Christ to Shankara eight centuries after him; scientists developing astronomy three thousand years ago, and winning Nobel prizes in our own time; a democratic constitution of untraceable antiquity in the villages, and wise and beneficent rulers like Ashoka and Akbar in the capitals; minstrels singing great epics almost as old as Homer, and poets holding world audiences today; artists raising gigantic temples for Hindu gods from Tibet to Ceylon and from Cambodia to Java, or carving perfect palaces by the score for Mogul kings and queens — this is the India that patient scholarship is now opening up, like a new intellectual continent, to that Western mind which only yesterday thought civilization an exclusively European thing.

## III. VERBATIM PASSAGES — THE CASE FOR INDIA (1930)

### B. Mother India — civilizational lineage

**Suggested MEMs:** MEM–INDIA–GEO–INDUS, MEM–INDIA–GEO–GANGES, MEM–INDIA–DYNASTY–MAURYA, MEM–INDIA–DYNASTY–GUPTA; MEMs on philosophy, transmission, village community.

> India was the motherland of our race, and Sanskrit the mother of Europe's languages: she was the mother of our philosophy; mother, through the Arabs, of much of our mathematics; mother, through the Buddha, of the ideals embodied in Christianity; mother, through the village community, of self-government and democracy. Mother India is in many ways the mother of us all.

— Will Durant, *The Case for India* (1930).  
**Source:** Wikiquote, Will Durant — The Case for India.

### C. India will teach — tolerance and maturity

**Suggested MEMs:** MEM–INDIA–GANDHI, MEM–INDIA–REPUBLIC–NEHRU; MEMs on plural cohesion, non-alignment, civilizational role.

> India will teach us the tolerance and gentleness of mature mind, understanding spirit and a unifying, pacifying love for all human beings.

— Will Durant, *The Case for India* (1930).  
**Source:** Wikiquote.

### D. Himalayan barrier — gifts to the west

**Suggested MEMs:** MEM–INDIA–GEO–INDUS, MEM–INDIA–DYNASTY–GUPTA; MEMs on transmission, numerals, logic.

> It is true that even across the Himalayan barrier India has sent to the west, such gifts as grammar and logic, philosophy and fables, hypnotism and chess, and above all numerals and the decimal system.

— Will Durant, *The Case for India* (1930).  
**Source:** Wikiquote.

### E. Railways — built for England, not India

**Suggested MEMs:** MEM–INDIA–BRITISH–EMPIRE, MEM–INDIA–PARTITION; MEMs on colonial political economy, liability.

> It might have been supposed that the building of 30,000 miles of railways would have brought a measure of prosperity to India. But these railways were built not for India but for England; not for the benefit of the Hindu, but for the purposes of the British army and British trade... The railroads are entirely in European hands, and the Government refuse to appoint even one Hindu to the Railway Board. The railways lose money year after year, and are helped by the Government out of the revenues of the people. All the loses are borne by the people, all the gains are gathered by the trader.

**Source:** Wikiquote.

### F. British rule — exploitation and high civilization destroyed

**Suggested MEMs:** MEM–INDIA–BRITISH–EMPIRE, MEM–INDIA–PARTITION, MEM–INDIA–BRITISH–EMPIRE–CLIVE.

> British rule in India is the most sordid and criminal exploitation of one nation by another in all recorded history. I propose to show that England has year by year been bleeding India to the point of death, and that self-government of India by the Hindus could not within any reasonable probability, have worse results than the present form of alien domination.

— Will Durant, *The Case for India* (1930).  
**Source:** Wikiquote.

### G. High civilization destroyed by trading company

**Suggested MEMs:** MEM–INDIA–BRITISH–EMPIRE, MEM–INDIA–DYNASTY–MUGHAL, MEM–INDIA–BRITISH–EMPIRE–CLIVE.

> This, evidently was not a minor civilization, produced by inferior people. It ranks with the highest civilizations of history, and some, like Keyserling, would place it at the head and summit of all. The British conquest of India was the invasion and destruction of a high civilization by a trading company utterly without scruple or principle, careless of art, greedy of gain, overrunning with fire and sword a country temporarily disordered and helpless, bribing and murdering, annexing and stealing, and beginning that career of illegal and "legal" plunder which has now gone on ruthlessly for one hundred and seventy-three years, and goes on at this moment while in our secure comfort we write and read. Those who have seen the unspeakable poverty and physiological weakness of the Hindus today will hardly believe that it was the wealth of eighteenth century India which attracted the commercial pirates of England and France.

### H. Village schools destroyed — illiteracy

**Suggested MEMs:** MEM–INDIA–BRITISH–EMPIRE; MEMs on governance, education, institutional rupture.

> When the British came there was, throughout India, a system of communal schools, managed by the village communities. The agents of the East India Company destroyed these village communities, and took steps to replace the schools; even today, after a century of effort to restore them, they stand at only 66% of their number a hundred years ago. Hence, the 93 % illiteracy of India.

### I. Famines — cause not absence of food but inability to pay

**Suggested MEMs:** MEM–INDIA–BRITISH–EMPIRE; MEMs on political economy, caloric/demographic stress.

> Sir William Hunter, estimated that 40,000,000 of the people of India were seldom or never able to satisfy their hunger.... We can now understand why there are famines in India. Their cause, in plain terms, is not the absence of food, but the inability of the people to pay for it. It was hoped the railways would solve the problem...the fact that the worst famines have come since the building of the railways...behind all these, as the fundamental source of the terrible famines in India, lies such merciless exploitation...

— Will Durant, *The Case for India* (1930), pp. 50–53.

### J. Amritsar / Dyer

**Suggested MEMs:** MEM–INDIA–BRITISH–EMPIRE, MEM–INDIA–PARTITION, MEM–INDIA–GANDHI.

> The news of this barbaric orgy of military sadism was kept from the world for half a year. A belated commission of inquiry was appointed by the Government. A committee appointed by the Indian National Congress made a more through investigation and reported 1,200 killed, and 3,600 wounded. Gen. Dyer was censured by the House of Commons, exonerated by the House of Lords, and was retired on a pension. Thinking this was insufficient the militarists of the Empire raised a fund of $150,000 for him and presented him with a jeweled sword of honor.
