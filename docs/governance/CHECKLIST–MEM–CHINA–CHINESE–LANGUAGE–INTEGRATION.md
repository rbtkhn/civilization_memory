# MEM–CHINA Chinese-Language Integration Checklist

**Purpose:** Ensure consistent application of ARC–CHINA v3.3 and the MEM authoring note (IX-B) when creating or editing MEM–CHINA files. Use for Phase 2/3 upgrades and for new MEMs.

**Reference:** CIV–ARC–CHINA v3.3; Plan *Major Upgrade: MEM–CHINA Corpus × Chinese-Language Sources*; AUDIT–SESSION–MEMS–CHINESE–LANGUAGE–SOURCES–2026–02–13.

## 1. Definition of "adequate" per MEM

For each MEM, **adequate** means:

1. **Primary or Secondary** section explicitly lists at least one **Chinese-language source** from ARC (e.g. 中国大百科全书 zgbk.com; npc.gov.cn Basic Law; 《元史》《金史》《宋史》《辽史》; Qian Mu 国史大纲).
2. **Where it materially improves accuracy or credibility:** at least one **citation or verbatim quote** in the MEM body from that source, with ARC attribution (e.g. "Source: 中国大百科全书, ARC–CHINA–T–MODERN" or "Source: npc.gov.cn Basic Law, ARC–CHINA–T-INSTITUTIONAL/OFFICIAL").
3. **Where no suitable Chinese source exists** for the MEM's scope: document in Primary/Secondary or a one-line note: "No Chinese-language source added; scope [brief reason]." (Auditable exception.)

No change to RLLs or existing English-language quotes; integration is **additive** (Chinese layer).

## 2. Source-selection by MEM type

| MEM type / topic | Preferred Chinese-language source(s) |
|------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **WAR** (Opium, Boxer, Song–Yuan, Mongol–Jin, Taiping, etc.) | Encyclopedia of China (battles, figures, campaigns); 《元史》《金史》《宋史》 where applicable (ARC named works). |
| **GEO** (rivers, Amur, Pearl, Tibet, etc.) | Encyclopedia of China (geography, place names); White Papers / gov.cn if MEM touches current borders or territorial narrative. |
| **Cession / return** (Hong Kong, Macau, Shenzhen) | npc.gov.cn Basic Law (Chinese); Encyclopedia of China (Hong Kong, Macau, 一国两制); treaty text in Chinese if available. |
| **PRC** (core, Mao, Deng, Zhou, etc.) | Encyclopedia of China; people.cn / gov.cn for policy narrative; CASS/CIIS for strategic framing where relevant. |
| **Dynasty** (Tang, Song, Yuan, etc.) | Encyclopedia of China; dynastic histories (cite by work name); Qian Mu 国史大纲 where thematic fit. |
| **City / place** (Beijing, Nanjing, Shanghai, etc.) | Encyclopedia of China (city entries); official or CASS if current policy relevance. |
| **LIT** (Kongzi, Sunzi, Laozi, etc.) | Already anchored in classical Chinese texts in ARC-T-ANCIENT; add Encyclopedia of China entry for author/work where it helps. |
| **Niche** (Xiongnu, Zhenghe, Marco Polo) | Encyclopedia of China where an entry exists; otherwise document exception. |

## 3. Attribution format

- **Encyclopedia of China:**  
  "(Source: Encyclopedia of China, 中国大百科全书, ARC–CHINA–T–MODERN.)"  
  Cite entry and edition when quoting (e.g. 中国大百科全书第三版，条目「…」).

- **Official docs (npc.gov.cn, gov.cn):**  
  "(Source: [document name], npc.gov.cn / gov.cn, ARC–CHINA–T-INSTITUTIONAL/OFFICIAL.)"

- **Dynastic histories / Qian Mu:**  
  Cite work + chapter/section; if a Chinese passage is quoted, provide translation and ARC attribution.

- **Verbatim quotes:**  
  May be given in translation in the MEM body with optional "Chinese text: …". Count toward template 20% verbatim-quote requirement.

---

## 4. Exception rule

If no suitable Chinese-language source exists for the MEM's scope (e.g. very niche topic, or no relevant Encyclopedia of China entry):

- Document in the MEM's Primary/Secondary or in a one-line note: **"No Chinese-language source added; scope [brief reason]."**
- Ensures the upgrade is auditable and not forced where inappropriate.

---

## 5. Self-check before finalising a MEM

- [ ] Primary or Secondary lists at least one explicit Chinese-language source from ARC (or exception documented)?
- [ ] At least one citation or verbatim quote in body with ARC attribution (or exception)?
- [ ] Existing English/secondary quotes and RLLs unchanged (additive only)?
- [ ] Template 20% verbatim-quote and scholarly-diversity rules still satisfied?

## 6. Remaining MEMs (backlog)

As of 2026-02-13 the original backlog in **UPGRADE–QUEUE–MEM–CHINA–CHINESE–LANGUAGE–2026–02–13.md** is **complete** (all 30 MEMs upgraded). For any **new or future** MEM–CHINA edits, apply this checklist (sections 1–5).
