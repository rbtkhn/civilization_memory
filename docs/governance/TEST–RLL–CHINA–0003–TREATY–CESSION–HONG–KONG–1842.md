# Test: RLL–CHINA–0003 — Treaty-Cession Limb (Hong Kong 1842)

**RLL under test:** RLL–CHINA–0003 (CANDIDATE) — cession–return–legitimacy pattern.  
**Case:** Treaty of Nanjing (1842)—cession of Hong Kong Island to Britain; opening of treaty ports; indemnity. First territorial cession of the "century of humiliation"; return (handover 1997) completes the arc.  
**Scope:** MEM corpus + ARC source base (CIV–ARC–CHINA v3.0).  
**Purpose:** Validate the **cession** limb of the RLL with same discipline as 9th- and 14th-century (reconstitution) tests.

## I. SOURCES CONSULTED

### MEM corpus (primary)
- **MEM–CHINA–HONG–KONG:** Cession (1842) by Treaty of Nanjing; "first territorial loss to treaty"; "humiliation as territorial loss"; contrast with treaty ports (opened, not ceded); handover (1997) as reconstitution; "lost—then returned."
- **MEM–CHINA–WAR–FIRST–OPIUM:** Structural opener of century of humiliation; Treaty of Nanjing—cession of Hong Kong, treaty ports, indemnity, extraterritoriality; asymmetric coercion; Qing could not resist; legitimacy and strategic memory encoded (humiliation template).
- **MEM–CHINA–GEO–PEARL–RIVER:** Delta as frame; Hong Kong as cession node; Guangzhou treaty port vs Hong Kong ceded; Shenzhen SEZ (1980), handover (1997)—same geography, humiliation then reconstitution.

## II. RLL–CHINA–0003 APPLIED (TREATY-CESSION LIMB)

### 1. Activation trigger

RLL applies to "**territorial cession**, handover, SEZ as reconstitution, or humiliation/recovery geography." Hong Kong 1842 is the **cession** case: sovereign territory transferred by treaty (Treaty of Nanjing). No reconstitution at the moment of cession—only loss; return comes later (1997). The RLL's cession limb is explicitly activated.

### 2. Pattern: "Legitimacy turns on who lost, who regained, who overreached"

**Who lost (Qing / China)**  
- **MEM:** Hong Kong "ceded" to Britain; "first territorial transfer" of the humiliation arc; "humiliation as territorial loss"; Qing capitulated; court accepted terms that compromised sovereignty (MEM–CHINA–WAR–FIRST–OPIUM).  
- **ARC (Lovell):** Treaty "hammered out under extraordinary conditions"; war's legacy "foundational to modern Chinese nationalism"; Opium War framed as "China's victimization—the beginning of a 'century of humiliation' by Western imperialism."  
- **ARC (CHoC):** Opium War and treaty system "fundamentally transformed China's relationship with the outside world."  
**Conclusion:** MEM and ARC agree: Qing lost territory and legitimacy was wounded; the cession encoded humiliation and opened the legitimacy narrative that would require "return" (1997) for reconstitution.

**Who regained (later: PRC in 1997)**  
- **MEM:** Handover (1997) "returned Hong Kong to PRC sovereignty"; "territory recovered; sovereignty asserted"; "reconstitution." So the *return* is not in 1842 but in 1997—the same RLL pattern holds across the arc: cession (loss) → return (reconstitution).  
- For the **1842 moment only**: the RLL's "who regained" is Britain (acquirer). Legitimacy for Qing: *lost*; for Britain: gain by imposition. The full cycle (who lost → who regained) spans 1842–1997: China lost, then China regained.  
**Conclusion:** The treaty-cession limb fits: legitimacy turned on who lost (Qing), who gained (Britain), and eventually who regained (PRC 1997). One geography, two moments—cession and return.

**Who overreached**  
- **MEM:** Not emphasized at 1842; the encoding is imposition and humiliation. In cross-civ parallel (Alsace–Lorraine), Germany "overreached" by annexation. Here, Britain's *gain* was by imposed treaty—structural overreach in the sense that the settlement created the conditions for a century of Chinese grievance and eventual return.  
- **ARC:** Lovell notes British narrative (opening closed empire) vs Chinese narrative (victimization); both sides have stakes. Overreach in RLL terms: the side that takes territory by imposition and later faces reversal (e.g. 1997) or permanent grievance.  
**Conclusion:** Britain as imposer; Qing as loser. Overreach can be read as imperial imposition that sowed the legitimacy narrative for return—consistent with RLL.

### 3. "One geography, multiple encodings"

Same geography (Pearl River delta; Hong Kong):  
- **Qing/Chinese encoding:** Cession = humiliation; first territorial loss; evidence of century of humiliation; later return = reconstitution.  
- **British encoding:** Acquisition by treaty; entrepôt; colony until 1997.  
- **Post-1997 encoding:** SAR; "one country, two systems"; territory returned.  
**Conclusion:** One geography holds multiple encodings (loss, gain, return); no requirement to resolve tension. RLL satisfied.

### 4. Three derivations (with ARC)

- **Mercouris:** Legitimacy encoding; recovery as conditional or reconstitution; institutional continuity across loss and return. **Fit:** Qing legitimacy wounded by cession; PRC legitimacy in 1997 asserted through return; continuity of "China" across loss and recovery.  
- **Mearsheimer:** Structural incentive to reclaim; gain can prove unstable when legitimacy gap follows. **Fit:** Britain had incentive to secure treaty and territory; Qing had no capacity to resist; later, PRC had structural incentive to reclaim; British gain was always contingent on Chinese acceptance of the loss—which was never granted, enabling 1997.  
- **Barnes:** Liability when return fails or is contested; irreversibility. **Fit:** Qing bore liability for accepting the treaty; what was irreversible was the *memory* of cession (humiliation template); 1997 made the territory reversible but the legitimacy narrative (we recovered what was lost) remained central.

### 5. MEM vs ARC: consistency

- **No contradiction:** MEM's "cession," "humiliation as territorial loss," "first territorial transfer," and handover as "reconstitution" align with Lovell's "century of humiliation" and CHoC's transformation of China's foreign relations.  
- **ARC adds:** Lovell's "poker game" (negotiation under duress); myth-busting on both British and Chinese simplifications; explicit link between war legacy and modern Chinese nationalism.  
- **Scope:** Treaty-cession limb is confirmed: formal cession of territory by unequal treaty fits the RLL; legitimacy turns on who lost, who gained, and (over time) who regained.

## III. LIMIT OF TEST

This test validates the **cession** limb only. The *return* (1997) was already part of the derivation (Pearl delta, SYNTHESIS 0014). The test confirms that the **moment of cession** (1842) is correctly captured by the RLL—loss, legitimacy wound, and eventual return as the completing move.

---

## IV. VERDICT

**RLL–CHINA–0003 holds** for the treaty-cession case (Hong Kong 1842, Treaty of Nanjing) **with MEM + ARC**. The cession limb is validated: (1) who lost (Qing), (2) who gained (Britain), (3) who later regained (PRC 1997), (4) one geography multiple encodings, (5) all three derivations apply. No ARC source contradicts the RLL. The RLL's phrase "cession, return, or reconstitution" is now stress-tested on **cession** (this test), **return** (1997 handover in derivation), and **reconstitution** (9th c., 14th c. tests). **Recommendation:** Treaty-cession limb confirmed; supports promotion of RLL–CHINA–0003.
