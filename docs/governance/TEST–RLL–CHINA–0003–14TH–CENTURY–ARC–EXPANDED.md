# Test: RLL–CHINA–0003 Against 14th-Century Example (ARC-Expanded)

**RLL under test:** RLL–CHINA–0003 (CANDIDATE) — cession–return–legitimacy pattern.  
**Case:** Fall of Yuan and Ming founding (1368).  
**Scope:** MEM corpus + full ARC source base (CIV–ARC–CHINA v3.0).

---

## I. SOURCES CONSULTED

### MEM corpus (primary)
- MEM–CHINA–DYNASTY–YUAN (1271–1368): legitimacy thin; conquest and force; collapse and absorption; "元亡而中国复。" (The Yuan fell, and China returned.)
- MEM–CHINA–DYNASTY–MING (1368–1644): restorative–consolidation; "驱逐胡虏，恢复中华。" (Expel the barbarians and restore China.); expulsion of foreign rule and restoration of Han governance; "天命在我。"

### ARC-listed sources (CIV–ARC–CHINA v3.0)

| ARC-T        | Author / Work | Use in test |
|--------------|----------------|-------------|
| ARC-T-MODERN | **Cambridge History of China** (Fairbank general editor; Mote, Twitchett eds.) | Yuan end and Ming rise chapters (Mote, Dardess). |
| ARC-T-MODERN | **Frederick W. Mote** — *Imperial China 900–1800* (Harvard, 1999) | Part Four: "The Restoration of Native Rule Under the Ming"; 1368 as establishment after overthrowing Mongol rule. |
| ARC-T-MODERN | **Timothy Brook** — *The Troubled Empire: China in the Yuan and Ming Dynasties* (Harvard, 2010) | Yuan collapse within a century; Mongol values persisting in Ming institutions; ecological/stress framing. |

### Cambridge History of China (ARC; Mote, Dardess, Franke, Twitchett)

- **Mote**, "The rise of the Ming dynasty, 1330–1367" (CHoC Vol. 7, 1988): Yuan's "ability to govern … was eroding well before the middle of the fourteenth century"; Ming "spawned during a half-century of intensifying chaos"; "struggle among potent rivals to succeed the Mongol regime by imposing, through military force, a successor regime that could **claim the Mandate of Heaven**"; "the way the Yüan dynasty disintegrated and the Ming dynasty emerged is by no means typical of the dynastic changes that punctuate imperial Chinese history."
- **Dardess**, "Shun-ti and the end of Yüan rule in China" (CHoC, 1994): Toghōn Temür reigned "in China, or at least Ta-tu, until 1368. He died in Mongolia in 1370"; "Why did the Yüan dynasty fall as and when it did? … no simple answer"; "the whole quality of political life during his reign came to constitute a **powerful negative example** to the builders of the next dynasty, the Ming."

### Supplementary (scholarship citing ARC-type framing; not in ARC list)

- Zhu Yuanzhang's slogans "expel the barbarians" (驱逐胡虏/蛮夷) and "restore China" (恢复中华) as legitimation (JAS, ArOr, standard surveys).
- Ming founding as "restoration" narrative: only one legitimate dynasty with Heaven's mandate; Ming as restoring Han rule after Mongol occupation.
- Yuan collapse: famines, Red Turban (1351+), military/political breakdown, flight 1368 to Shangdu then Mongolia (Northern Yuan).

## II. RLL–CHINA–0003 APPLIED WITH ARC SOURCES

### 1. Activation trigger

RLL applies to "territorial cession, handover, SEZ as **reconstitution**, or humiliation/recovery geography." The 14th-century case is **reconstitution**: the realm (China proper) is lost by the Yuan and claimed by the Ming as "restored." No treaty cession; "return" is rhetorical and territorial (restoration of control). **ARC confirmation:** Mote (CHoC) frames the transition as rivals competing "to succeed the Mongol regime" and "claim the Mandate of Heaven"; Mote (*Imperial China*) titles Part Four "The **Restoration** of Native Rule Under the Ming." So the RLL’s reconstitution/return limb is explicitly supported by ARC.

### 2. Pattern: "Legitimacy turns on who lost, who regained, who overreached"

**Who lost (Yuan)**  
- **MEM:** Legitimacy thin (conquest, force); "上下离心"; "元亡而中国复."  
- **ARC (Cambridge):** Mote: Yuan's ability to govern was "eroding well before the middle of the fourteenth century"; Ming emerged from "intensifying chaos." Dardess: Shun-ti's reign was a "powerful **negative example**" for the Ming builders; Yuan fell with "no simple answer" despite "energetic effort … to save it."  
- **ARC (Brook):** Yuan "collapsed within a century"; stress and ecological factors.  
**Conclusion:** MEM and ARC agree: Yuan lost the realm; legitimacy and governance had already eroded; the last reign serves as negative template.

**Who regained (Ming)**  
- **MEM:** "恢复中华"; "天命在我"; expulsion of foreign rule and restoration of Han governance.  
- **ARC (Mote, CHoC):** Successor regime "could **claim the Mandate of Heaven**."  
- **ARC (Mote, *Imperial China*):** "**Restoration** of Native Rule Under the Ming."  
- **Supplementary:** Zhu’s slogans and orthodox framing of Ming as "restoring Han Chinese rule" after foreign occupation.  
**Conclusion:** MEM and ARC agree: Ming frames itself as restorer of the realm and holder of the mandate; legitimacy is restoration + mandate.

**Who overreached (Yuan)**  
- **MEM:** Conquest-based legitimacy; administrative continuity but legitimacy thin; "gain that proved unstable."  
- **ARC (Dardess):** Last reign as "powerful negative example" for Ming.  
- **ARC (Mote):** Transition "by no means typical"—underscoring Yuan’s distinctive failure.  
**Conclusion:** Yuan’s rule is encoded as overreach (conquest legitimacy that could not be sustained); ARC supports the RLL’s Mearsheimer derivation.

### 3. "One geography, multiple encodings"

Same realm (China proper, Central Plain and south):  
- **Yuan encoding:** Foreign rule that lost the mandate; "元亡而中国复"; negative example for the next dynasty.  
- **Ming encoding:** Restoration of native rule; "恢复中华"; Mandate of Heaven; expulsion of barbarians.  
**ARC:** Mote and Dardess explicitly contrast Yuan collapse with Ming founding and Ming’s use of Yuan’s reign as negative example; Mote’s "Restoration of Native Rule" frames the same space under a new encoding. No resolution of tension required; RLL satisfied.

### 4. Three derivations (with ARC)

- **Mercouris:** Legitimacy encoding; recovery as reconstitution; institutional continuity across loss and return. **ARC:** Mote (*Imperial China*) emphasizes "restoration" and Ming’s adoption of Yuan/Song administrative practices; Brook notes "Mongol values persisted in Ming institutions." Continuity across the break is affirmed in ARC.  
- **Mearsheimer:** Structural incentive to reclaim; gain can prove unstable when legitimacy gap follows. **ARC:** Cambridge History describes erosion of Yuan capacity and chaos preceding Ming; Dardess on "negative example" and failed efforts "to save it." Structural reading supported.  
- **Barnes:** Liability when return fails or is contested; irreversibility. **ARC:** Yuan bears the collapse; Shun-ti’s reign fixed as negative example; 1368 flight and Northern Yuan mark irreversible end of Mongol rule in China proper. Ming’s "return" is the decisive reconstitution.

### 5. MEM vs ARC: consistency and nuance

- **No contradiction:** MEM quotes ("元亡而中国复," "驱逐胡虏，恢复中华," "天命在我") align with ARC narrative and with standard scholarship on slogans and restoration.  
- **ARC adds:** (1) Mote’s "Mandate of Heaven" and "Restoration of Native Rule" as canonical phrasing; (2) Dardess’s "negative example" for Yuan’s last reign; (3) Brook’s ecological and persistence-of-Mongol-values angle; (4) Mote’s point that this transition was "by no means typical," sharpening the legitimacy/overreach reading.  
- **Scope:** ARC does not override MEM; it confirms and specifies. The RLL holds under both MEM-only and MEM+ARC.

## III. LIMIT OF TEST

The case does not exercise **treaty cession** or **handover**; it exercises **reconstitution** and **return-as-restoration**. The RLL’s "cession, return, **or** reconstitution" is explicitly satisfied on the reconstitution and return limbs. Cession limb remains tested by other cases (e.g. Hong Kong 1842, Alsace–Lorraine 1871).

---

## IV. VERDICT

**RLL–CHINA–0003 holds** when tested against the 14th-century example (Yuan fall, Ming founding 1368) **with the full ARC source base**. MEM and ARC-listed sources (Cambridge History of China—Mote, Dardess; Mote *Imperial China*; Brook *Troubled Empire*) agree on: (1) Yuan as loser and negative example, (2) Ming as restorer claiming the Mandate of Heaven, (3) legitimacy and reconstitution as the stakes, (4) one geography with two encodings. No ARC source contradicts the RLL; several supply canonical phrasing (restoration, mandate, negative example) that strengthens the test. The expanded test confirms that RLL–CHINA–0003 usefully applies to **reconstitution without treaty cession** when supported by both MEM and ARC.
