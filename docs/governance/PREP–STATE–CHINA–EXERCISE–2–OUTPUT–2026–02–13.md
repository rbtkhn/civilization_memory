# PREP — Exercise 2 Output: CORE Diagnostic → Material Option Mapping (STATE–CHINA)

**Date:** 2026-02-13  
**Source:** CIV–CORE–CHINA v3.0, CIV–DOCTRINE–CHINA v1.0, CIV–STATE–TEMPLATE § IV / VII / VII.A  
**Purpose:** Map every CORE–CHINA mandatory output to material options; draft 5 material options with explicit binding constraints; cross-check doctrines.

---

## I. CORE–CHINA MANDATORY OUTPUTS (COMPLETE LIST)

From CIV–CORE–CHINA Sections II–XVI and XX:

| Output | Section | Values | Binding for material option when … |
|--------|---------|--------|-------------------------------------|
| **MSI** (Mandate Stability Index) | II | STABLE / STRAINING / FRACTURED | Option A (Continuity Dominance): MSI is binding when the option assumes mandate remains stable or straining; if MSI = FRACTURED the option fails. |
| **PLS** (Performance Legitimacy Score) | II | HIGH / MED / LOW | Option A: PLS is binding when legitimacy-through-performance is the path; if PLS declines while SOC stays high, coercive substitution begins and option logic shifts. |
| **SOC** (Social Order Coherence) | II | HIGH / MED / LOW | Option A: SOC is binding when the option assumes internal order holds; if SOC and PLS decline together, mandate fracture accelerates and option fails. |
| **EAL** (Elite Alignment Level) | II | ALIGNED / STRESSED / FRACTURED | Option A: EAL is binding when the option assumes elite cohesion; if EAL = FRACTURED, party–state fusion is under stress and option viability drops. |
| **Spatial Integrity** | IV | INTACT / STRAINED / BREACHED | Option C (Maritime/Spatial): Spatial Integrity is binding when the option involves territorial or maritime consolidation; if BREACHED (e.g. fragmentation, encirclement), option fails per Strategic Red Lines. |
| **AT** (Administrative Throughput) | V | HIGH / MED / LOW | Option A: AT is binding when the option relies on vertical penetration and cadre effectiveness; if AT drops, consolidation-through-administration fails. |
| **LCF** (Local–Central Friction) | V | LOW / MED / HIGH | Option A: LCF is binding when the option assumes central control; if LCF = HIGH, option (e.g. national scaling of policy) is at risk. |
| **IRR** (Industrial Replacement Rate) | VI | ABOVE / AT / BELOW | Option E (Compute/Industrial): IRR is binding when the option assumes industrial depth and substitution capacity; if IRR = BELOW, tech sovereignty and exit-building are constrained. |
| **EAC** (Employment Absorption Capacity) | VI | HIGH / MED / LOW | Option A: EAC is binding when legitimacy depends on employment absorption; if EAC = LOW, social stability and PLS are at risk. |
| **Compute Sovereignty** | VII | SECURE / CONTESTED / FRAGILE | Option E: Compute Sovereignty is binding when the option involves tech decoupling or AI stack control; if FRAGILE, option fails per Strategic Red Lines (compute dependency). |
| **Escalation Stability** | VIII | STABLE / STRAINING / UNSTABLE | Option C: Escalation Stability is binding when the option involves military or maritime pressure; if UNSTABLE, escalation path is high-risk. |
| **Internal Stability** | IX | HIGH / MED / LOW | Option A: Internal Stability is binding when the option assumes no major internal rupture; if LOW, mandate and SOC are threatened. |
| **Narrative Control** | X | DOMINANT / CONTESTED / FRACTURED | Option A, D: Narrative Control is binding when the option relies on message harmonization or face-saving; if FRACTURED, accommodation and narrative-based settlement are harder. |
| **Time Advantage** | XI | CHINA / ADVERSARY / NEUTRAL | Option A, C: Time Advantage is binding when the option assumes patience favours China; if ADVERSARY, endurance and delay work against China. |
| **EPV** (Exit Progress Vector) | XII | FINANCE / LOGISTICS / COMPUTE / ALL | Option B: EPV is binding when the option is exit-building or parallel-system construction; progress on EPV dimensions determines option viability. |
| **Axis Optionality** | XIII | WIDENING / STABLE / NARROWING | Option B: Axis Optionality is binding when the option involves partnership diversification or sanctions exit; if NARROWING, exit and reorientation are constrained. |
| **SAF-CH** (Split-Axis Failure) | XIV | INTACT / FRACTURED / FAILED | All options: SAF-CH is binding when the composite of belief axis (MSI, SOC, EAL) and feasibility axis (IRR, AT, Spatial) is assessed; if SAF-CH = FAILED, return-to-normal is invalid (RIR-CH). |
| **THI-CH** (Time Hostility Indicator) | XIV | ALLY / NEUTRAL / HOSTILE | Option A, C: THI-CH is binding when the option assumes time or external alignment is favourable; if HOSTILE, environment is against China. |
| **GRID-CH** (Irreversibility Grid) | XV | REVERSIBLE / STICKY / IRREVERSIBLE | Option D (Accommodation): GRID-CH is binding when the option assumes reversibility of a concession or exit; if IRREVERSIBLE, accommodation may be locked in. |
| **RIR-CH** (Restoration Invalidation Rule) | XVI | INACTIVE / ACTIVE | All options: RIR-CH is binding when GRID-CH = IRREVERSIBLE or SAF-CH = FAILED; if RIR-CH = ACTIVE, return-to-normal forecasts are invalid. |

**Strategic Classification** (XX) is a verdict output, not a binding variable for a single option; it synthesizes the above.

**Result:** No CORE mandatory output is orphaned; each is assigned to at least one material option or to “all options” (SAF-CH, RIR-CH).

## II. DOCTRINE HARD CONSTRAINTS → OPTION CONSTRAINTS

| Doctrine | Hard constraint (summary) | Option constraint |
|----------|----------------------------|-------------------|
| **01** (Peak Then Exhaustion) | Peak reach does not guarantee durability; pressure + rigidity converge irreversibly. | Option A: If external pressure and internal rigidity converge irreversibly, continuity-dominant path fails (maps to SAF-CH, GRID-CH). |
| **02** (Rupture-to-Reconstitution) | Monopolization via party–state fusion and vertical penetration; not constitutional/procedural continuity. Consolidation before normalization. | Option A: Any option that assumes “constitutional reform as path to legitimacy” or “procedural continuity as mechanism” is **invalid** if Doctrine 02 holds—reconstitution requires monopolization, not liberal constitutionalism. Option D (accommodation) can include de-escalation but not regime-form change that contradicts party–state fusion. |
| **03** (Conquest-as-Connectivity) | Conquest creates condition for connectivity; corridors and adaptive governance outlast conquest. | Option B (exit-building): If China builds parallel systems (EPV), Doctrine 03 does not forbid it; it describes historical pattern. Option C (maritime/corridor): Corridor control and connectivity logic are consistent with 03; binding constraint is Spatial Integrity / Escalation Stability, not 03 directly. |

**Cross-check:** Doctrine 02 implies that a material option framed as “legitimacy through constitutional or procedural reform” is **excluded** unless CORE/doctrine are revised. Doctrine 01 and 03 inform **when** options fail (exhaustion, corridor loss) but do not exclude options by name.

## III. FIVE MATERIAL OPTIONS (DRAFT FOR SECTION IV)

### OPTION A: Continuity Dominance — Performance Legitimacy and Administrative Throughput

**Grounded in:** Legitimacy and institutional continuity; power distribution (structural capacity).

**Reasoning:** China sustains mandate through performance (order, material provisioning, stability), party–state fusion, and vertical penetration. As long as MSI is not FRACTURED, SOC and EAL hold, and AT remains sufficient, the path of “continue current trajectory with incremental reform within party–state frame” is viable. Doctrine 02 implies consolidation is already achieved; normalization (stability, law, technocratic legitimacy) is the current phase.

**Key Assumptions:**
• MSI remains STABLE or STRAINING (not FRACTURED) — Linchpin: YES  
• SOC and EAL do not both degrade sharply (mandate fracture acceleration) — Linchpin: YES  
• AT and LCF remain sufficient for central policy to scale (HIGH or MED AT; LOW or MED LCF) — Linchpin: YES  
• Internal Stability remains HIGH or MED — Linchpin: NO  
• EAC supports employment absorption so that PLS does not collapse — Linchpin: NO  

**Confidence:** MODERATE (plausible under stated assumptions; depends on no major internal or external shock).

**Grounding:** Assessed against CORE–CHINA legitimacy and governance outputs (MSI, PLS, SOC, EAL, AT, LCF, Internal Stability) and precedents from MEM–CHINA–PRC (reconstitution), MEM–CHINA–DYNASTY–SONG (institutional legitimacy), MEM–CHINA–DYNASTY–QING (peak then exhaustion). **Binding constraint: Mandate Stability Index (MSI)** — if MSI moves to FRACTURED, legitimacy accounting fails and continuity-dominant path collapses; MSI is the shortest time-to-collapse variable among legitimacy indicators and the least directly controllable by single policy levers.

**Risks:** If PLS declines while SOC stays high, coercive legitimacy substitution may set in, eroding long-term stability. If EAL fractures, party–state cohesion fails. If external pressure and internal rigidity converge (Doctrine 01), exhaustion phase begins.

**Conditions for success:** Performance delivery continues; elite alignment holds; administrative throughput sustains vertical penetration; no major defection or legitimacy rupture.

**Conditions for failure:** MSI = FRACTURED; or SOC and PLS decline together; or EAL = FRACTURED; or SAF-CH = FAILED.

**Discriminating evidence:** MSI and EAL movement over 30–90 days; major elite defection or public legitimacy crisis; LCF spikes (local defiance or policy blockage).

---

### OPTION B: Exit-Building and Axis Diversification

**Grounded in:** Power distribution (structural optionality); legitimacy (narrative and partnership as resources).

**Reasoning:** China builds parallel systems (finance, logistics, compute) and widens axis optionality (Russia, Persia, Global South) to reduce dependency on Anglia/US and to insulate against containment or sanctions. CORE XII (Exit–Building Meta-Doctrine) and XIII (Cross–Civilizational Synchronization) support this path. Viability depends on EPV progress and Axis Optionality not narrowing.

**Key Assumptions:**
• Axis Optionality remains WIDENING or STABLE (not NARROWING) — Linchpin: YES  
• EPV (Finance / Logistics / Compute / ALL) shows progress on at least one vector — Linchpin: YES  
• Partner states (e.g. Russia, Persia) remain willing and able to sustain depth partnership or sanctions-exit role — Linchpin: YES  
• Compute Sovereignty does not move to FRAGILE (exit-building requires secure compute) — Linchpin: NO  

**Confidence:** MODERATE (structural logic favours diversification under containment pressure; partner capacity and willingness are partly outside China’s control).

**Grounding:** Assessed against CORE–CHINA EPV, Axis Optionality, Compute Sovereignty and precedents MEM–CHINA–SILK–ROAD (corridor connectivity), MEM–CHINA–MONGOL–EMPIRE–PAX–MONGOLICA (pragmatic universalism, cross-entity connectivity), MEM–CHINA–PRC–KISSINGER (strategic opening). **Binding constraint: Axis Optionality** — if Axis Optionality moves to NARROWING, partners defect or are closed off and exit-building loses structural support; China cannot unilaterally control partner choices.

**Risks:** Partners may defect or be pressured; EPV progress may stall; Compute Sovereignty may degrade (Fragile), triggering Strategic Red Line (compute dependency).

**Conditions for success:** Axis Optionality WIDENING or STABLE; EPV progress on at least one dimension; no catastrophic partner defection.

**Conditions for failure:** Axis Optionality = NARROWING; or EPV stalled across all vectors; or Compute Sovereignty = FRAGILE.

**Discriminating evidence:** Axis Optionality trend (partnership depth, new agreements, sanctions-exit usage); EPV milestones (e.g. BRI finance, yuan settlement, semiconductor substitution); partner public commitment or reversal.

---

### OPTION C: Maritime and Spatial Consolidation (Including Taiwan Strait)

**Grounded in:** Power distribution (maritime denial, first-island-chain, spatial integrity); legitimacy (territorial sovereignty narrative).

**Reasoning:** China pursues near-seas dominance, first-island-chain sensitivity, and port-network sovereignty (CORE IV). Option includes deterrence, pressure, and conditional escalation to protect Spatial Integrity and resist maritime encirclement (Strategic Red Line). Viability depends on Escalation Stability and Spatial Integrity; if escalation is uncontrolled or spatial breach occurs, option fails.

**Key Assumptions:**
• Spatial Integrity remains INTACT or STRAINED (not BREACHED) — Linchpin: YES  
• Escalation Stability remains STABLE or STRAINING (not UNSTABLE) — Linchpin: YES  
• Time Advantage favours China or is NEUTRAL (patience as asset) — Linchpin: NO  
• Opponent (e.g. US/Taiwan) does not escalate faster than China can absorb — Linchpin: YES (relative)  

**Confidence:** LOW to MODERATE (depends heavily on opponent response and escalation control; relative degradation matters).

**Grounding:** Assessed against CORE–CHINA Spatial Integrity, Escalation Stability, Strategic Red Lines (maritime encirclement) and precedents MEM–CHINA–WAR–SONG–YUAN (naval/riverine as decisive), MEM–CHINA–GEO–TAIWAN–STRAIT, MEM–CHINA–GEO–SOUTH–CHINA–SEA. **Binding constraint: Escalation Stability** — if Escalation Stability moves to UNSTABLE, military or maritime pressure produces uncontrolled escalation and option collapses; escalation dynamics are partly outside China’s control (opponent response). For relative framing: “whether China can sustain spatial consolidation without opponent escalation exceeding China’s escalation control” — both curves matter.

**Risks:** Uncontrolled escalation; maritime encirclement achieved by adversary; Spatial Integrity BREACHED (e.g. permanent loss of control in Taiwan Strait). Opponent Constraint Assessment (Section VI-B) required for full analysis.

**Conditions for success:** Escalation remains controlled; Spatial Integrity intact; time and THI-CH favourable or neutral.

**Conditions for failure:** Escalation Stability = UNSTABLE; Spatial Integrity = BREACHED; or opponent escalation dominates.

**Discriminating evidence:** Escalation Stability and Spatial Integrity over 30–90 days; opponent force posture and signalling; incident frequency and severity in Strait/SCS.

---

### OPTION D: Negotiated Accommodation or De-escalation

**Grounded in:** Legitimacy (face-saving, narrative control); leadership liability (who can concede without being removed).

**Reasoning:** China seeks face-saving settlement or de-escalation (e.g. cross-strait, trade, or crisis management) that preserves narrative control and avoids irreversible loss. This is the **accommodation/reversal** option per Template v3.3 (duty of competence). Viability depends on Narrative Control (message harmonization), GRID-CH (reversibility of any concession), and RIR-CH (whether return-to-normal is still valid). If RIR-CH = ACTIVE, accommodation may be the only path left but “return to normal” is invalid.

**Key Assumptions:**
• Narrative Control remains DOMINANT or CONTESTED (not FRACTURED) so that accommodation can be framed — Linchpin: YES  
• GRID-CH is REVERSIBLE or STICKY (not IRREVERSIBLE) for the dimension being conceded — Linchpin: YES  
• RIR-CH = INACTIVE (return-to-normal still valid) or, if ACTIVE, accommodation is explicit management of irreversibility — Linchpin: YES  
• Counterparty is willing to offer face-saving terms — Linchpin: YES (partly outside control)  

**Confidence:** LOW to MODERATE (depends on counterparty and domestic narrative tolerance; Doctrine 02 does not forbid de-escalation but constrains regime-form change).

**Grounding:** Assessed against CORE–CHINA Narrative Control, GRID-CH, RIR-CH and precedents MEM–CHINA–WAR–FIRST–OPIUM (face vs survival, Treaty of Nanjing), MEM–CHINA–PRC–KISSINGER (negotiated opening), MEM–CHINA–LIT–ROMANCE–THREE–KINGDOMS (face and refusal to yield as narrative poles). **Binding constraint: Narrative Control** — if Narrative Control = FRACTURED, leadership cannot harmonize message and accommodation may be framed as capitulation, collapsing domestic legitimacy for the path; narrative is the least controllable in the short term once fractured.

**Risks:** Accommodation framed as surrender; GRID-CH moves to IRREVERSIBLE (concession locked in); counterparty does not offer face-saving exit.

**Conditions for success:** Narrative Control sufficient to frame accommodation; GRID-CH allows reversibility or managed irreversibility; counterparty cooperates.

**Conditions for failure:** Narrative Control = FRACTURED; or GRID-CH = IRREVERSIBLE and RIR-CH = ACTIVE with no managed narrative.

**Discriminating evidence:** Narrative Control trend; public and elite reaction to any concession; GRID-CH and RIR-CH status after any deal.

---

### OPTION E: Compute and Industrial Sovereignty (Tech Substitution and Decoupling)

**Grounded in:** Power distribution (structural capacity); CORE VII (Compute), VI (IRR, EAC).

**Reasoning:** China prioritizes domestic semiconductor substitution, AI model sovereignty, and manufacturing depth (IRR) to secure Compute Sovereignty and reduce external dependency. Strategic Red Line: compute dependency. Option succeeds if Compute Sovereignty is SECURE or CONTESTED and IRR is ABOVE or AT; fails if Compute Sovereignty = FRAGILE or IRR = BELOW with no path to recovery.

**Key Assumptions:**
• Compute Sovereignty remains SECURE or CONTESTED (not FRAGILE) — Linchpin: YES  
• IRR is ABOVE or AT (industrial replacement keeps pace) — Linchpin: YES  
• EAC supports workforce for tech and manufacturing (HIGH or MED) — Linchpin: NO  
• External supply or sanction shock does not outpace substitution — Linchpin: YES (partly outside control)  

**Confidence:** MODERATE (structural incentive is clear; execution and external shock are uncertain).

**Grounding:** Assessed against CORE–CHINA Compute Sovereignty, IRR, EAC, Strategic Red Lines (compute dependency) and precedents MEM–CHINA–PRC–DENG–XIAOPING (reform-era upgrading), MEM–CHINA–DYNASTY–QING (late Qing institutional rigidity and external pressure). **Binding constraint: Compute Sovereignty** — if Compute Sovereignty moves to FRAGILE, the option fails per Strategic Red Line (compute dependency); China has limited short-term control over external cutoff or internal breakthrough pace.

**Risks:** External cutoff before substitution completes; IRR falls BELOW; Compute Sovereignty = FRAGILE.

**Conditions for success:** Compute Sovereignty SECURE or CONTESTED; IRR ABOVE or AT; substitution milestones met.

**Conditions for failure:** Compute Sovereignty = FRAGILE; IRR = BELOW with no recovery path.

**Discriminating evidence:** Compute Sovereignty assessment; IRR and EAC trends; semiconductor and AI supply-chain data; sanction or export-control events.

## IV. BINDING CONSTRAINT SUMMARY TABLE

| Option | Title | Binding constraint (single variable) | CORE source |
|--------|--------|--------------------------------------|-------------|
| A | Continuity Dominance | MSI (Mandate Stability Index) | § II |
| B | Exit-Building / Axis Diversification | Axis Optionality | § XIII |
| C | Maritime / Spatial Consolidation | Escalation Stability | § VIII |
| D | Negotiated Accommodation | Narrative Control | § X |
| E | Compute / Industrial Sovereignty | Compute Sovereignty | § VII |

---

## V. ORPHAN CHECK (CORE OUTPUTS COVERED)

All CORE mandatory outputs appear in at least one option’s assumptions or binding constraint:

- MSI, PLS, SOC, EAL → A (and SAF-CH composite)  
- Spatial Integrity → C  
- AT, LCF → A  
- IRR, EAC → A, E  
- Compute Sovereignty → B, E  
- Escalation Stability → C  
- Internal Stability → A  
- Narrative Control → A, D  
- Time Advantage, THI-CH → A, C  
- EPV → B  
- Axis Optionality → B  
- SAF-CH, GRID-CH, RIR-CH → All (composite / failure physics)  

**Result:** No orphaned CORE output. Every material option has exactly one explicit binding constraint drawn from CORE. Doctrines 01–03 are reflected: 01 (exhaustion) in A failure conditions; 02 (party–state, no constitutional path) as exclusion of regime-form option; 03 (connectivity) in B/C context.

## VI. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CIV–STATE–CHINA SECTION IV

1. **Copy options A–E** into CIV–STATE–CHINA Section IV when the file is created; assign option letters per template (A, B, C, D, E).
2. **Add Opponent Constraint Assessment (Section VI-B)** if Option C (and optionally A) are analysed with a principal opponent (e.g. US); frame C’s binding constraint as **relative** where applicable (both degradation curves).
3. **Evidence placeholders:** Replace “Assessed against …” with actual precedent names from MEM SCAN once MEM–RELEVANCE–CHINA is used in session; add “Evidence update: [date] [brief]” as evidence accumulates.
4. **Doctrine 02:** In STATE file Purpose or Section III, state explicitly that “constitutional or procedural reform as path to legitimacy” is **excluded** by Doctrine 02; Option D (accommodation) is de-escalation and face-saving, not regime-form change.
5. **Stability Indicators (Section VI):** Populate Section VI with the same CORE outputs (MSI, PLS, SOC, EAL, AT, LCF, IRR, EAC, Compute Sovereignty, Spatial Integrity, Escalation Stability, Internal Stability, Narrative Control, Time Advantage, EPV, Axis Optionality, SAF-CH, THI-CH, GRID-CH, RIR-CH) and current assessment placeholders so that options can reference “Section VI” in grounding.
