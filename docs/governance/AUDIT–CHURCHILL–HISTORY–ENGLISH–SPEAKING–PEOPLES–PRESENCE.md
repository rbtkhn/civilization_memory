**Purpose:** Map presence in ARC, MEM, CORE, and index; flag attribution errors and citation gaps

---

## I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

| Category | Status |
|----------|--------|
| **ARC registration** | ANGLIA ✓ (Churchill listed with *A History of the English-Speaking Peoples*) |
| **Explicit title citations** | 2 MEMs cite the title; 1 attribution error (Roberts wrongly cited as author of this book) |
| **Churchill (any work) in Anglia MEMs** | 15+ MEMs reference Churchill; most do not cite *History of the English-Speaking Peoples* by title |
| **Other civilizations** | Churchill cited in FRANCIA, GERMANIA, RUSSIA — *The Second World War*, *The World Crisis*, speeches; not *History of the English-Speaking Peoples* |

**Summary:** Churchill is correctly registered in CIV–ARC–ANGLIA with *A History of the English-Speaking Peoples*. The work is **explicitly cited by title** in MEM–ANGLIA–BRITISH–EMPIRE (once correctly, once with an **attribution error**) and MEM–ANGLIA–VICTORIA (correctly, with verbatim quote). **Error:** MEM–ANGLIA–BRITISH–EMPIRE line 175 attributes a quote to "(*Roberts,* *The History of the English-Speaking Peoples*)"; *A History of the English-Speaking Peoples* is Churchill’s work, not Andrew Roberts’s. Roberts’s relevant titles are *Churchill: Walking with Destiny*, *The Storm of War*, etc. **Recommendation:** Correct the Roberts citation in MEM–ANGLIA–BRITISH–EMPIRE to the appropriate Roberts title. **DONE:** Citation changed to *Andrew Roberts, Churchill: Walking with Destiny* (2026-01-30).

## II. ARC REGISTRATION

| Civilization | ARC file | Churchill / *History of the English-Speaking Peoples* |
|--------------|----------|------------------------------------------------------|
| ANGLIA | CIV–ARC–ANGLIA | ✓ Winston Churchill (1874) — The Second World War; **A History of the English-Speaking Peoples**; The World Crisis |

No other civilization’s ARC lists *History of the English-Speaking Peoples*; Churchill appears in FRANCIA/GERMANIA/RUSSIA MEMs via *The Second World War*, *The World Crisis*, or speeches.

## III. MEM FILES — EXPLICIT CITATIONS OF *A HISTORY OF THE ENGLISH-SPEAKING PEOPLES*

| File | Location | Citation | Note |
|------|----------|----------|------|
| MEM–ANGLIA–BRITISH–EMPIRE | Lines 26–31 | Churchill, *History of the English-Speaking Peoples* | ✓ Correct. Verbatim-style quote on “habits of law, administration, and finance.” |
| MEM–ANGLIA–BRITISH–EMPIRE | Lines 171–175 | **(*Roberts,* *The History of the English-Speaking Peoples*)** | ✗ **ERROR.** Roberts did not write this book; it is Churchill’s. Quote (“Britain exited empire not because…”) is likely from Roberts (e.g. *Churchill: Walking with Destiny* or another Roberts title). Fix: change to correct Roberts title. |
| MEM–ANGLIA–VICTORIA | Lines 55–61 | Churchill, *A History of the English-Speaking Peoples* | ✓ Correct. Verbatim quote on Crown ceasing to govern and consenting to reign. |

## V. OTHER CIVILIZATIONS — CHURCHILL BUT NOT *HISTORY OF THE ENGLISH-SPEAKING PEOPLES*

| Civilization | MEMs | Churchill work(s) cited |
|--------------|------|--------------------------|
| FRANCIA | MEM–FRANCIA–GEO–MEUSE–RIVER | *The Second World War* |
| GERMANIA | MEM–GERMANIA–ENGLAND, MEM–GERMANIA–WAR–TIRPITZ, MEM–GERMANIA–GEO–NORTH–SEA, MEM–GERMANIA–GEO–ATLANTIC–OCEAN, MEM–GERMANIA–GEO–ODER–RIVER, MEM–GERMANIA–SLAVS, MEM–GERMANIA–AACHEN | *The World Crisis*, House of Commons speeches, *The Second World War* (1940) |
| RUSSIA | MEM–RUSSIA–WAR–GREAT–PATRIOTIC–YALTA, MEM–RUSSIA–WAR–GREAT–PATRIOTIC–TEHRAN | Churchill as actor; Feis *Churchill, Roosevelt, Stalin*; Miner *Between Churchill and Stalin* |

## VI. TITLE AND EDITION NOTE

Full title: *A History of the English-Speaking Peoples* (4 vols., 1956–1958).  
Some MEMs use “*History of the English-Speaking Peoples*” or “*A History of the English-Speaking Peoples*”; both are acceptable. No mandatory normalization.

## VII. RECOMMENDED FIXES

1. **MEM–ANGLIA–BRITISH–EMPIRE (lines 171–175):** Correct attribution. ~~Change (*Roberts,* *The History of the English-Speaking Peoples*) to appropriate Roberts title~~ **DONE.** Citation now: *Andrew Roberts, Churchill: Walking with Destiny*.

2. **Optional:** In Anglia MEMs that reference Churchill on English/British history without citing a title, add “(*A History of the English-Speaking Peoples*)” where the paraphrase or quote is in fact from that work, for ARC consistency and traceability.
