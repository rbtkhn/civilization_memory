# ROADMAP–CMC–3.3

**Status:** ACTIVE · EXECUTION  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Author:** CMC System  
**Date:** 2026-02-13  
**Governed by:** CMC 3.3

---

## I. OVERVIEW

CMC 3.3 activates the previously re-scoped integration program streams:

| Stream | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| Tiered Retrieval | MEM-first search with controlled web fallback |
| Living ARC | Source lifecycle, validation, and promotion tracking |
| MIND Navigation | Perspective-driven surfacing of connections/sources/concepts |
| CEP Residuals | Backward illumination and current-event learning not already absorbed by STATE |

---

## II. IMPLEMENTATION PHASES

### Phase A — Governance Activation (Complete)

**Goal:** Make 3.3 normative at governance layer.

Deliverables:
- VERSION–MANIFEST, CMC–BOOTSTRAP, CIV–MEM–CORE updated to CMC 3.3
- CHANGELOG release entry and roadmap migration complete
- Program streams moved from pending/re-scoped wording to active wording

Exit criteria:
- Binding declaration references CMC 3.3
- Normative core documents cross-reference ROADMAP–CMC–3.3

---

### Phase B — Rule/Template Synchronization (In Progress)

**Goal:** Align active cursor rules and templates with 3.3 semantics.

Deliverables:
- Active rules reference 3.3 protocol status where relevant
- No contradictory 3.2 pending-language in active enforcement paths
- Backward-compatible aliases retained (e.g., relay/harvest)

Exit criteria:
- Rule-to-template references pass consistency checks
- No drift findings in governance checks for upgraded paths

---

### Phase C — Tooling Integration Baseline (Planned)

**Goal:** Operationalize 3.3 streams with lightweight automation.

Deliverables:
- Tiered retrieval usage logs integrated into operational workflow
- Living ARC source metrics capture integrated into console schema path
- CEP residual outputs mapped to SCHOLAR integration points

Exit criteria:
- At least one reproducible run for each stream in tools workflow
- Validation and traceability artifacts recorded in governance docs

---

### Phase D — Cross-Stream Hardening (Planned)

**Goal:** Ensure streams interact coherently at scale.

Deliverables:
- Shared source/citation patterns across civilizations surfaced
- MIND affinity behavior validated against traversal outputs
- CEP backward illumination mapped to concrete SCHOLAR update pathways

Exit criteria:
- Cross-stream contradictions documented and resolved at governance layer
- Quarterly drift checklist includes 3.3 stream checks

---

## III. VALIDATION CHECKPOINTS

- `tools/cmc-governance-checks.sh .`
- `python3 tools/cmc-validate-corpus.py --changed-only`
- Changelog entry for normative governance changes
- Version-manifest consistency (binding declaration + major version table)

---

## IV. NON-GOALS FOR 3.3 PREP

- No broad rewrite of historical audit archives
- No forced migration of legacy-compatible content headers
- No change to content-version decoupling policy
