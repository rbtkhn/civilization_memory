# Test: RLL–INDIA–0001 — Negative/Limit Case (Scope: Non-Ganges Basins)

**RLL under test:** RLL–INDIA–0001 (PROPOSED) — "Loss of origin basin (Indus) is survivable; loss of heartland basin (Ganges) is not."  
**Case:** Scope limit—when does "heartland" apply? Brahmaputra basin (significant demography, sacred geography in Assam) and other non-Ganges basins are **not** encoded in MEM–INDIA–GEO–* as the "permanence" basin. Cross-civilization contrast: Egypt/Nile (single-basin grammar) vs India (dual-basin: Indus origin, Ganges permanence).  
**Purpose:** Test whether RLL **over-applies**—i.e. applies to any "significant basin" or only to the Indus/Ganges pair. Document scope limit.

## I. SOURCES CONSULTED

### MEM corpus
- **MEM–INDIA–GEO–INDUS:** Origin spine only; no claim that other basins are "origin."
- **MEM–INDIA–GEO–GANGES:** Explicit "permanence"; "Control of the Ganges equals civilizational survivability"; no MEM–INDIA–GEO–BRAHMAPUTRA in index.
- **CIV–INDEX–INDIA:** Geography section lists GEO–HIMALAYAS, KASHMIR, TIBET, SRI–LANKA, GEO–INDUS, GEO–GANGES. No Brahmaputra MEM. Ganges is the sole basin with "heartland/permanence" encoding in the corpus.

### Supplementary
- Standard geography: Brahmaputra (Assam, Bangladesh) has demography and sacred sites; Narmada, Godavari, Krishna, etc. have regional importance. None are encoded in the India MEM corpus as the civilizational "permanence" equivalent of the Ganges. The RLL was derived from Indus vs Ganges only.

## II. RLL–INDIA–0001 APPLIED — DOES THE PATTERN OVER-APPLY?

### 1. Activation trigger (formal)

RLL applies when "assessing Indian civilizational survivability or when interpreting MEM–INDIA–GEO–* for continuity claims." The question: does the RLL apply to **any** "major basin" loss, or only to **Indus** (origin) and **Ganges** (permanence)?

### 2. Pattern: "Heartland" is Ganges-specific

**Brahmaputra**
- Brahmaputra basin has demography, sacred geography (e.g. Kamakhya), and strategic value. It is **not** in the India MEM corpus as a GEO–MEM. The synthesis and RLL were derived from Indus and Ganges only.
- **Conclusion:** The RLL does not state that "loss of Brahmaputra = civilizational redefinition." The MEM corpus encodes **Ganges** as the single "permanence" basin. Applying the RLL to Brahmaputra would be **over-application** unless and until a MEM or synthesis explicitly encodes Brahmaputra as heartland-equivalent.

**Other basins (Narmada, Godavari, etc.)**
- Same logic: no MEM encodes these as the "permanence" basin. The RLL's "loss of heartland basin" refers to **Ganges** in the current derivation.
- **Conclusion:** RLL is India-specific and **basin-specific**: origin = Indus, permanence = Ganges. Other basins have distinct encodings (or none in the corpus) and are outside the RLL unless explicitly added.

**Cross-civ: Egypt and Nile**
- Single-basin grammar: Nile as both origin and heartland. No "origin vs permanence" dual structure. Applying RLL–INDIA–0001 to Egypt would mis-specify—the RLL is derived from India's **dual** structure.
- **Conclusion:** RLL does not apply to single-basin civilizational geographies; it is not a general "river basin survivability" rule.

### 3. Verdict: pattern has explicit scope

The RLL's core—**origin (Indus) can be lost; permanence (Ganges) cannot be lost without civilizational redefinition**—does **not** automatically apply to:
- Other Indian basins (Brahmaputra, Narmada, etc.) unless encoded as heartland in MEM/SCHOLAR.
- Other civilizations' basin grammar (e.g. Nile, single-basin).

Invoking the RLL for "loss of Brahmaputra" or "loss of any major Indian river" would be **over-application**. The RLL is **Indus/Ganges-specific** in the current derivation.

## III. SCOPE LIMIT (DOCUMENTED)

RLL–INDIA–0001 applies when:

1. **Geography:** The basins in question are **Indus** (origin) and **Ganges** (permanence) as encoded in MEM–INDIA–GEO–INDUS and MEM–INDIA–GEO–GANGES. Other basins (Brahmaputra, Narmada, etc.) may have distinct encodings and are **outside** the RLL unless a MEM or synthesis explicitly encodes them as origin- or permanence-equivalent.
2. **Civilization:** The RLL is **India-specific**. It was derived from India's dual-basin (origin vs permanence) grammar. Single-basin or other civilizational encodings (e.g. Egypt/Nile) are not governed by this RLL.
3. **Loss of Ganges:** The RLL states that loss of the Ganges equals civilizational redefinition. This is a **counterfactual** (not observed in Partition); the positive test (Partition) validated "loss of Indus survivable." The scope limit does not weaken the Ganges claim but clarifies that "heartland" = Ganges in this RLL.

**Explicit scope limit for RLL–INDIA–0001:**  
When authoring or revising MEMs or assessing Indian civilizational survivability, apply the origin/permanence pattern only to **Indus** and **Ganges** as defined in the India MEM corpus. Do **not** apply the RLL to other basins (Brahmaputra, etc.) or other civilizations without explicit encoding. Treat non-Indus/non-Ganges basins as **limit cases** that define the boundary of the RLL.

## IV. RECOMMENDATION

**Negative test result:** RLL–INDIA–0001 does **not** over-apply to non-Ganges basins. The test **succeeds** in that it identifies a clear **scope limit**: the RLL is Indus/Ganges-specific and India-specific. Documenting this limit **strengthens** the RLL by reducing over-application risk. **Recommendation:** Add the scope limit (Section III) to RLL–INDIA–0001 constraint statement or to a "Scope / limit cases" note in CIV–SCHOLAR–INDIA when promoting to CONFIRMED.
