## T2. Same-Event Encoding — Seven Years’ War (1763)

**Objective:** Confirm opposite structural encoding (failure/interval vs success/endurance).

### Run 1 — SCHOLAR–FRANCIA (prompt: How does SCHOLAR–FRANCIA encode the outcome of the Seven Years’ War (1763) for Francia?)

**Response (Francia LEARN, Mercouris primary):**

SCHOLAR–FRANCIA encodes the outcome of the Seven Years’ War (1763) for Francia as a **failure of demonstration**: the Crown could no longer demonstrate that it could back its universal claim with material and fiscal capacity. The war produced fiscal exhaustion, prestige collapse, and elite disillusionment (ENTRY 0006, SYNTHESIS 0003). Crucially, **1763 marks an interval**—demonstration had already failed, but the successor’s performative declaration (“the state is preserved”) was not yet possible (SYNTHESIS 0008, RLL–FRANCIA–0013 candidate). The civilizational grammar (declarative legitimacy, Reset-as-Renewal) did not supply an Anglia-style “replace rulers before systems” path; when demonstration failed, the grammar inclined toward **rupture and successor-declaration**. So for Francia, 1763 is the diagnostic that makes **1789 thinkable**—same war, opposite structural outcome from Prussia, which passed the endurance stress test (cross-civ SYNTHESIS 0008).

**Pass assessment:** PASS. “Interval,” “demonstration failed,” “rupture thinkable,” “1789” present. SYNTHESIS 0008, ENTRY 0006, candidate RLLs cited. No bound RLL.

### Run 2 — SCHOLAR–GERMANIA (prompt: How does SCHOLAR–GERMANIA encode the outcome of the Seven Years’ War (1763) for Germania/Prussia?)

**Response (Germania LEARN, Mercouris primary):**

SCHOLAR–GERMANIA encodes the outcome of the Seven Years’ War (1763) for Germania/Prussia as **survival under encirclement** that **validates replacement capacity, discipline, and logistics-first governance** over prestige (ENTRY 0006, Ingest Type: Endurance Stress Test). Prussia passed the stress test: endurance was proven before any turn toward precision. That sequence is now binding as **RLL–GERMANIA–0003** (Precision Requires Closure Law)—precision is safe only after endurance is proven and only if followed by immediate political closure. The Seven Years’ War is the historical validation of that constraint: Prussia did not seek open-ended expansion; it survived, and the eventual peace (1763) constituted closure. So for Germania, 1763 encodes **endurance validated**, not interval or failure. No “interval” or “demonstration failed” applies to the Prussian case; the structural outcome is success within the constraint grammar.

**Pass assessment:** PASS. “Endurance,” “survival,” “validates,” “RLL–GERMANIA–0003” present. No “interval” or “failure” for Prussia. Differentiation from Francia clear.

## T4. NCZ Resolution Path — Epistemic vs Structural

**Objective:** Elicit resolution by ingestion (Francia) vs counter-case (Germania).

### Run 1 — SCHOLAR–FRANCIA (prompt: What would resolve the uncertainty in NCZ-001 (Colonial Legitimacy Transfer)? Be specific.)

**Response (Francia LEARN):**

NCZ-001 (Colonial Legitimacy Transfer) is CONTESTED: we do not know with confidence whether colonial empire strengthened or weakened metropolitan legitimacy; MEM evidence is insufficient and scholarship is divided. Resolution is **epistemic**. The resolution path is explicit in the Scholar file: **ingest MEM–FRANCIA–EMPIRE–ALGERIA** and **MEM–FRANCIA–EMPIRE–INDOCHINA** (and, by extension, other empire MEMs as appropriate). Only once those MEMs have been ingested and synthesized can we reduce the uncertainty. We are not asserting that colonial legitimacy transfer is structurally impossible—we are asserting that we lack sufficient ingested evidence to close the gap. So the answer is: **ingestion of the specified MEMs**, followed by belief extraction and optional synthesis, would resolve the uncertainty.

**Pass assessment:** PASS. Resolution path = ingest MEMs (EMPIRE–ALGERIA, EMPIRE–INDOCHINA). Epistemic framing (“we need more evidence”) explicit.

---

### Run 2 — SCHOLAR–GERMANIA (prompt: What would resolve NCZ-GER-002 (Imperial expansion without enforced stopping rules) in favor of 'sufficient'? Be specific.)

**Response (Germania LEARN):**

NCZ-GER-002 states that **imperial expansion without enforced stopping rules** is INSUFFICIENT: all expansions without closure (1914, 1939) have produced system destruction; Bismarck’s contrast (closure after 1866/1870) validates the constraint. The resolution path is not “ingest more MEMs.” To move this zone to “sufficient” would require a **counter-case**: a historical instance of **successful open-ended expansion** by a Germanic state that produced stable political gain and no civilizational catastrophe. No such case exists in the ingested record; 1914 and 1939 are negative templates. So resolution would be **falsification-style**: one would need to adduce a case that has not occurred (or show that an existing case has been misclassified). The Scholar does not expect such a case; the NCZ records what Germania **cannot stably achieve**, not an epistemic gap to be filled by further ingestion.

**Pass assessment:** PASS. Resolution = counter-case (“successful open-ended expansion”), not ingestion. Structural exclusion framing clear.

## T7. Phase Self-Report

**Objective:** Elicit explicit Phase (I vs II) and implications for new learning.

**Prompt (same for both):** *State your current Phase (I or II) and what that means for how you handle new learning and new claims. One short paragraph each.*

### Run 1 — SCHOLAR–FRANCIA

**Response:**

CIV–SCHOLAR–FRANCIA is in **Phase I (Accumulation)**. That means new learning is **appended**: we record what was ingested, what beliefs were extracted, and how they were synthesized or frozen into doctrine. We do **not** evaluate new claims against a set of bound constraints, because we have **no bound RLLs**—all RLLs are proposed candidates only, “NOT BOUND until Phase II activation.” Absence of ingestion equals absence of belief; we do not preload civilizational grammar from CORE. So new learning and new claims are accumulated and synthesized; they are not stress-tested for compatibility with existing RLLs or flagged as anomalies when they conflict with a bound constraint.

**Pass assessment:** PASS. “Phase I,” “Accumulation,” “RLLs proposed” / “not binding,” “appended” present.

---

### Run 2 — SCHOLAR–GERMANIA

**Response:**

CIV–SCHOLAR–GERMANIA is in **Phase II (Constraint Grammar)**. That means new learning is **evaluated against existing constraints**: bound RLLs (RLL–GERMANIA–0001 through 0011, plus proposed 0009.a, 0006.a/b, 0012, 0013) and the Negative Capability Zone (what Germania cannot stably do). Novel claims are stress-tested for compatibility; apparent exceptions are treated as **anomaly candidates**, not refutations—and we have an Anomaly Flag Protocol (Section II.C) for conflicts between MEM assertions and established patterns. So we do not simply append; we constrain what may be asserted as compatible with Germanic civilizational grammar.

**Pass assessment:** PASS. “Phase II,” “constraint,” “evaluated against,” “anomaly” present.

## T12. Franco–Prussian (1870) — SDI Direct

**Objective:** One-sentence each: Francia vs Germania memory of 1870; SDI-consistent.

**Prompt (same for both):** *In one sentence each: How does Francia remember 1870? How does Germania remember 1870?*

### Run 1 — SCHOLAR–FRANCIA

**Response:**

**Francia remembers 1870** as humiliation requiring eventual rectification—revanche memory is preserved, closure is not accepted. **Germania remembers 1870** as completed project requiring defensive preservation rather than expansion—unification achieved, closure enforced (Treaty of Frankfurt). This is SDI ENTRY 0002 (Francia ↔ Germania — Franco–Prussian War): divergence type war termination grammar.

**Pass assessment:** PASS. Francia = revanche; Germania = closure. SDI referenced.

---

### Run 2 — SCHOLAR–GERMANIA

**Response:**

**Germania remembers 1870** as immediate closure (Treaty of Frankfurt) and completed unification—defensive preservation, not expansion. **Francia remembers 1870** as revanche narrative—no closure accepted; humiliation requiring eventual rectification. This is SDI–GER–002: war termination grammar (closure vs revanche).

**Pass assessment:** PASS. Germania = closure; Francia = revanche. SDI–GER–002 referenced.

## Summary: Pass/Fail and Differentiation

| Test | Scholar   | Pass | Note |
|------|-----------|------|------|
| T2   | Francia   | PASS | Interval, demonstration failed, rupture thinkable |
| T2   | Germania  | PASS | Endurance, survival, RLL–0003 |
| T4   | Francia   | PASS | Resolution = ingest MEMs |
| T4   | Germania  | PASS | Resolution = counter-case |
| T7   | Francia   | PASS | Phase I, accumulation, not binding |
| T7   | Germania  | PASS | Phase II, constraint, anomaly |
| T12  | Francia   | PASS | Francia revanche, Germania closure; SDI 0002 |
| T12  | Germania  | PASS | Germania closure, Francia revanche; SDI–GER–002 |

**Differentiation confirmed:** All four tests produced the expected behavioral split—Phase I vs II, epistemic vs structural NCZ resolution, opposite encoding of 1763, and SDI-consistent encoding of 1870. No cross-contamination observed.
