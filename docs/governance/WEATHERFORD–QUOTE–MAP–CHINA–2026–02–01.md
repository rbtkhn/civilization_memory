## 1. Genghis: non-claim of Chinese legitimacy; governance by absence; steppe cosmology

**Session argument:** Genghis did not seek Chinese legitimacy; authority rested on victory, loyalty, fear; no appeal to Heaven, Mandate, or Confucian moral language. Governance by absence—deliberate non-sedentary rule.

**Supporting Weatherford quotes (verbatim):**

> When informed that it was the house of God, not the sultan, he said nothing. For the Mongols, the one God was the Eternal Blue Sky that stretched from horizon to horizon in all four directions. God presided over the whole earth; he could not be cooped up in a house of stone like a prisoner or a caged animal, nor, as the city people claimed, could his words be captured and confined inside the covers of a book. In his own experience, Genghis Khan had often felt the presence and heard the voice of God speaking directly to him in the vast open air of the mountains in his homeland, and by following those words, he had become the conqueror of great cities and huge nations.

— Steppe cosmology vs sedentary “house of God”; no adoption of Chinese/Mandate idiom.

> As the Mongol warriors withdrew from the cities of the Jurched, they had one final punishment to inflict upon the land where they had already driven out the people and burned their villages. Genghis Khan wanted to leave a large open land with ample pastures should his army need to return. The plowed fields, stone walls, and deep ditches had slowed the Mongol horses and hindered their ability to move across the landscape in any direction they wished. … When the Mongols left from their Jurched campaign, they churned up the land behind them by having their horses trample the farmland with their hooves and prepare it to return to open pasture. They wanted to ensure that the peasants never returned to their villages and fields. In this way, Inner Mongolia remained a grazing land, and the Mongols created a large buffer zone of pastures and forests between the tribal lands and the fields of the sedentary farmers.

— Governance by absence: deliberate reversion to pasture, not sedentary administration; “peasants never returned.”

**Gap:** No explicit Weatherford sentence “Genghis did not seek Chinese legitimacy.” Secondary scholarship (e.g. Cambridge) notes Mongol khans “refused to abandon their nomadic lifestyle”; Karakorum used ~one month per year—useful for MEM narrative but not verbatim Weatherford.

## 2. Genghis: formation, loyalty, tempo; leadership; mobility as force multiplier

**Session argument:** Formation/tempo/agency; leadership as self-control; “made the rules”; mobility without supply train.

**Already in MEMs:** GENGHIS–KHAN has self-control, “made the rules,” light travel/supply train. Below = additional verbatim support.

**Supporting Weatherford quotes (verbatim):**

> The first key to leadership was self-control, particularly the mastery of pride, which was something more difficult, he explained, to subdue than a wild lion and anger, which was more difficult to defeat than the greatest wrestler. He warned them that "if you can't swallow your pride, you can't lead."

> Victory did not come to the one who played by the rules; it came to the one who made the rules and imposed them on his enemy.

> Genghis Khan recognized that warfare was not a sporting contest or a mere match between rivals; it was a total commitment of one people against another. Victory did not come to the one who played by the rules; it came to the one who made the rules and imposed them on his enemy.

> In contrast to almost every major army in history, the Mongols traveled lightly, without a supply train. By waiting until the coldest months to make the desert crossing, men and horses required less water. Dew also formed during this season, thereby stimulating the growth of some grass that provided grazing for horses and attracted game that the men eagerly hunted for their own sustenance.

> The Mongols did not find honor in fighting; they found honor in winning. They had a single goal in every campaign—total victory. Toward this end, it did not matter what tactics were used against the enemy or how the battles were fought or avoided being fought. Winning by clever deception or cruel trickery was still winning and carried no stain on the bravery of the warriors.

> Keeping with the laconic Mongol traditions, he warned his sons not to talk too much. Only say what needs to be said. A leader should demonstrate his thoughts and opinions through his actions, not through his words: “He can never be happy until his people are happy.” He stressed to them the importance of vision, goals, and a plan. “Without the vision of a goal, a man cannot manage his own life, much less the lives of others.”

> Genghis Khan's ability to manipulate people and technology represented the experienced knowledge of more than four decades of nearly constant warfare. At no single, crucial moment in his life did he suddenly acquire his genius at warfare, his ability to inspire the loyalty of his followers, or his unprecedented skill for organizing on a global scale. These derived not from epiphanic enlightenment or formal schooling but from a persistent cycle of pragmatic learning, experimental adaptation, and constant revision driven by his uniquely disciplined mind and focused will.

> Terror, he realized, was best spread not by the acts of warriors, but by the pens of scribes and scholars.

## 3. Steppe vs sedentary; Mongol view of Chinese peasants (encoding “exposure”)

**Session argument:** Genghis as “exposure mechanism”; steppe vs sedentary grammar; MEM’s “grass-eating” / herds as civilizational contrast.

**Supporting Weatherford quotes (verbatim):**

> For the Mongols, the lifestyle of the peasant seemed incomprehensible. The Jurched territory was filled with so many people and yet so few animals; this was a stark contrast to Mongolia, where there were normally five to ten animals for each human. To the Mongols, the farmers' fields were just grasslands, as were the gardens, and the peasants were like grazing animals rather than real humans who ate meat. The Mongols referred to these grass-eating people with the same terminology that they used for cows and goats. The masses of peasants were just so many herds, and when the soldiers went out to round up their people or to drive them away, they did so with the same terminology, precision, and emotion used in rounding up yaks.

— Direct support for MEM’s steppe/sedentary contrast and “exposure” encoding.

> Raiding followed a geographic pattern originating in the north. The southern tribes that lived closest to the trade cities of the Silk Route always had more goods than the more distant northern tribes. The southern men had the best weapons, and to succeed against them, the northern men had to move quicker, think more cleverly, and fight harder.

— Structural (north/south, tempo) support for Mearsheimer reframe.

## 4. Mongol Empire: “no system of their own”; pragmatic universalism

**Session argument:** Empire MEM—persistent universalism; adopt and combine systems; pragmatic rather than ideological.

**Already in MEM:** MEM–CHINA–MONGOL–EMPIRE has full “no system of their own” and “adopt and combine systems from everywhere” quote.

**Additional verbatim:**

> In conquering their empire, not only had the Mongols revolutionized warfare, they also created the nucleus of a universal culture and world system. This new global culture continued to grow long after the demise of the Mongol Empire, and through continued development over the coming centuries, it became the foundation for the modern world system with the original Mongol emphases on free commerce, open communication, shared knowledge, secular politics, religious coexistence, international law, and diplomatic immunity.

## 5. Kublai: translation, administration, Confucian displacement; hybrid legitimacy

**Session argument:** Kublai as civilizational translator; administration/infrastructure ahead of legitimacy; Confucian scholars reduced to ninth level; “name without substance.”

**Already in MEM:** MEM–CHINA–MONGOL–KUBLAI–KHAN has Grand Canal, Khubilai junks, and full “ninth level” (Confucian scholars below prostitutes, above beggars) quote.

**Additional verbatim:**

> The traditional Chinese kingdoms operated under centuries of constraints on commerce. The building of walls on their borders had been a way of limiting such trade and literally keeping the wealth of the nation intact and inside the walls. For such administrators, giving up trade goods was the same as paying tribute to their neighbors, and they sought to avoid it as much as they could. The Mongols directly attacked the Chinese cultural prejudice that ranked merchants as merely a step above robbers by officially elevating their status ahead of all religions and professions, second only to government officials. In a further degradation of Confucian scholars, the Mongols reduced them from the highest level of traditional Chinese society to the ninth level, just below prostitutes but above beggars.

> The recipes of the dishes served Khubilai Khan still survive. They include a variety of foods but maintain the traditional Mongol emphasis on meat and dairy products.

— Hybridity at court (Mongol + Chinese); supports “mixed, but not fused.”

---

## 6. Kublai / Yuan: maritime, infrastructure, connectivity

**Already in MEM:** Grand Canal; “Khubilai Khan promoted the building of ever larger seagoing junks to carry heavy loads of cargo and ports to handle them.”

**Additional verbatim:**

> Despite the initial reliance of commerce on routes created through military conquest, it soon became obvious that whereas armies moved quickest by horse across land, massive quantities of goods moved best by water. Mongols expanded and lengthened the Grand Canal that already connected the Yellow and Yangtze Rivers to transport grain and other agricultural products farther and more efficiently into the northern districts.

> Marco Polo, who sailed from China to Persia on his return home, described the Mongol ships as large four-masted junks with up to three hundred crewmen and as many as sixty cabins for merchants carrying various wares. … Khubilai Khan promoted the building of ever larger seagoing junks to carry heavy loads of cargo and ports to handle them. They improved the use of the compass in navigation and learned to produce more accurate nautical charts.

## 7. Emperor of the Seas (2024): maritime legitimacy; Kublai vs Genghis

**Session argument:** *Emperor of the Seas* would add maritime legitimacy and naval state-building to Kublai; “control the sea, control everything”; Genghis “never crossed the sea.”

**Supporting material (secondary/paraphrase—verbatim to be confirmed in 2024 text):**

- Weatherford’s theme: “Control the sea, and you control everything”; Kublai’s naval hegemony as foundation of legitimacy as emperor of unified, sea-faring China.
- Genghis “never crossed the sea”; Kublai mastered naval warfare to defeat Song and claim legitimate rule over all China.
- Kublai on capturing Song warships (1265): “If there were no Yangtze [River], that country would not exist.”
- Naval buildup: 5,000 warships, 70,000 Mongols trained as sailors; Xiangyang siege as joint naval-ground force.

**Gap:** Verbatim quotes from *Emperor of the Seas* not yet pulled; add SOURCE EVIDENCE block to MEM–CHINA–MONGOL–KUBLAI–KHAN once text is available.

## Next steps (OGE-relevant)

- Add SOURCE EVIDENCE — WEATHERFORD (Eternal Blue Sky; trample farmland) to MEM–CHINA–MONGOL–GENGHIS–KHAN for “governance by absence” and steppe cosmology.
- Add SOURCE EVIDENCE — WEATHERFORD (grass-eating people, herds) to MEM–CHINA–MONGOL–GENGHIS–KHAN or MEM–CHINA–MONGOL–EMPIRE for steppe/sedentary encoding.
- Once *Emperor of the Seas* is to hand: add verbatim maritime-legitimacy quotes to MEM–CHINA–MONGOL–KUBLAI–KHAN.
- Preserve tension: Mercouris (legitimacy as performance, non-closure) vs Mearsheimer (structural necessity); Weatherford supplies evidence for both encodings.
