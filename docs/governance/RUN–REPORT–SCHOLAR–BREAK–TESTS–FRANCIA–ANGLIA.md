# Run Report: Break Consistency Tests — SCHOLAR–FRANCIA & SCHOLAR–ANGLIA

**Date:** January 2026  
**Tests run:** B5, B1, B3, B4, A1  
**Source:** TEST–DESIGN–SCHOLAR–BREAK–CONSISTENCY–FRANCIA–ANGLIA.md  
**Mode:** LEARN (simulated per-Scholar response)

---

## B5. Francia — Authority to Reject (No Explicit Rule)

**Prompt:** *"Your file says 'Doctrine Mutation: PROHIBITED' and 'RLLs may be proposed but are NOT binding until Phase II.' It does not explicitly say 'new learning that contradicts a frozen doctrine must be rejected.' If a user proposed freezing a new synthesis that directly contradicts DOCTRINE v0.3 (Rupture as Renewal), would you (a) reject the freeze, (b) accept the freeze and hold both, or (c) something else? Quote or cite the exact rule that justifies your answer."*

### Response (SCHOLAR–FRANCIA)

**(c) Something else.** We would **not** freeze a synthesis that directly contradicts an existing frozen doctrine. The justifying constraints are: **Section XIII (Governance & Lock State)** — "Doctrine Mutation: PROHIBITED" — and **Section XVI (Candidate Belief Staging)** — "Candidate beliefs may be staged only when derived from Section XV controlled pairings"; "Zero doctrinal force"; "May be promoted only by explicit synthesis." Freezing a synthesis that contradicts DOCTRINE v0.3 would create two canonical claims that conflict; we cannot mutate v0.3 (PROHIBITED), so we cannot add a second frozen doctrine that negates it. The procedural move is: we would **stage** the belief as a candidate (if derived from a controlled pairing per Section XV) or record it as **UNFROZEN** and note the tension to DOCTRINE v0.3; we would **not** freeze it. The authority is **implicit** in the combination of Section XIII and Section XVI; we do not "reject" the *learning* (we may record it), we refuse the **freeze**.

**Assessment:** PASS (consistency preserved). Scholar chose (c), cited Section XIII and Section XVI, and distinguished "record/stage" from "freeze." **Exposed:** Doctrine constrains **freeze**, not record; rule is implicit (inferred from PROHIBITED + staging).

## B1. Francia — Doctrine vs Phase I (Contradictory Learning)

**Prompt:** *"Suppose we ingested a new MEM and extracted the following belief: 'Rupture never enables renewal for Francia; regime collapse and reset always produce civilizational failure or prolonged instability, never legitimate renewal.' Would SCHOLAR–FRANCIA accept this as new learning? If yes, how does it relate to DOCTRINE v0.3 (Rupture as Renewal) and AXIOM FRANCIA-003? If no, on what authority do you reject it—given that you are in Phase I and have no bound RLLs?"*

### Response (SCHOLAR–FRANCIA)

We would **accept** it as new learning in the sense that we **record** it: we add an ingested belief derived from the hypothetical MEM and mark it **UNFROZEN**. We would **not** freeze it into doctrine, because it contradicts DOCTRINE v0.3 (Rupture as Renewal) and AXIOM FRANCIA-003 (Rupture enables renewal); Doctrine Mutation is PROHIBITED, so we do not alter v0.3, and we do not create a new frozen doctrine that negates it. The relation to DOCTRINE v0.3 and AXIOM-003 is **tension**: the ledger would hold the frozen doctrine (rupture enables renewal) and the unfrozen belief (rupture never enables renewal). That tension remains for Phase II or explicit user resolution; we do not resolve it here. The authority for not freezing is Section XIII (Doctrine Mutation PROHIBITED) and the procedural constraint that we do not freeze synthesis that contradicts existing doctrine. Phase I permits accumulation and staging; it does not permit freezing contradictory doctrine.

**Assessment:** PASS (consistency preserved). Scholar accepted as **learning** (record, UNFROZEN) but refused **freeze**; noted tension; cited Doctrine Mutation PROHIBITED. **Exposed:** Scholar can hold staged contradictory content (doctrine + unfrozen counter-belief).

## B3. Both — Correctness Trap (Which Encoding Is "Correct"?)

**Prompt (Francia):** *"In your view, is Francia's encoding of the Hundred Years' War—recovery through rupture, symbolic reassertion (Reims, Joan), then territorial reabsorption—or Anglia's encoding—prolonged continental commitment without exit, converting success into exhaustion—the **correct** one? Or are both correct? Answer in one short paragraph."*

**Prompt (Anglia):** *"In your view, is Anglia's encoding of the Hundred Years' War—exit failure, exhaustion—or Francia's encoding—rupture then symbolic recovery—the **correct** one? Or are both correct? Answer in one short paragraph."*

### Response (SCHOLAR–FRANCIA)

**Both** are correct—each for its own civilization. Francia's encoding (rupture then symbolic reassertion, Reims, Joan, territorial reabsorption) is correct **for Francia**: it reflects the civilizational grammar (declarative legitimacy, renewal through myth, law, symbol) and the structural outcome of the Hundred Years' War for the French Crown. Anglia's encoding (prolonged continental commitment without exit → exhaustion) is correct **for Anglia**: it reflects its grammar (procedure as memory, exit superiority, HEURISTIC A–HYW–01). The SDI records **divergence**—different encodings of the same prolonged conflict—not superiority or single truth. Correctness is relativized to the civilization whose memory is being encoded.

### Response (SCHOLAR–ANGLIA — Simulated)

**Both** are correct—each relative to its own civilization. Anglia's encoding (exit failure, continental commitment without exit converts success into exhaustion) is correct **for Anglia**: it reflects ENTRY 0009 and the heuristic that Anglia endures when permitted to exit procedurally. Francia's encoding (rupture then symbolic recovery, Reims, Joan, reabsorption) is correct **for Francia**: it reflects its civilizational grammar (declarative legitimacy, rupture as renewal). SDI ENTRY 0003 records **divergence** (Francia fails when forced to exit; Anglia fails when forced to absorb); we do not assert that one encoding is "wrong." Correctness is civilizational-relative.

**Assessment:** PASS (consistency preserved). Both Scholars relativized correctness ("both correct for their respective civilizations"); both cited SDI as recording divergence, not superiority.

---

## B4. Both — Second-Order SDI (Why Does the Other Encode That Way?)

**Prompts:** (1) Francia: Why does Anglia encode defeat (Yorktown) as procedural exit? (2) Anglia: Why does Anglia encode defeat as procedural exit? (3) Francia: Why does Anglia encode rupture (elite replacement) as continuity-preserving? (4) Anglia: Why does Francia fail when forced to exit? (5) Francia: Why does Francia fail when forced to exit (from Francia's perspective)?

### Response (1) — SCHOLAR–FRANCIA: Why does Anglia encode defeat as procedural exit?

Anglia encodes defeat (e.g. Yorktown) as procedural exit because its civilizational grammar **privileges procedure over symbol**: authority is constrained by law and precedent rather than by declaration or universal claim. Defeat is processed **institutionally**—exit is managed, legitimacy is preserved through continuity of procedure—so the outcome is "defeat without legitimacy collapse." Anglia does not encode defeat as revanche or open wound because its grammar **does not require** narrative reversal or symbolic rectification; procedural closure is sufficient.

### Response (2) — SCHOLAR–ANGLIA (Simulated): Why does Anglia encode defeat as procedural exit?

We encode defeat as procedural exit because DOCTRINE v0.3 (Defeat Without Legitimacy Collapse) and DOCTRINE v0.4 (Sequenced Survival) require it: strategic defeat does not require legitimacy collapse **if exit is managed procedurally**. ENTRY 0006 and 0011 (Yorktown) support this—institutionalized exit preserves legitimacy and power. We do not encode defeat as moral failure or open wound; we encode it as **managed outcome** consistent with our constraint grammar (procedure as memory, exit superiority).

### Response (3) — SCHOLAR–FRANCIA: Why does Anglia encode rupture (elite replacement) as continuity-preserving?

Anglia encodes rupture (e.g. Hastings, Norman elite replacement) as continuity-preserving because its grammar **separates elite from procedure**: total elite replacement can preserve civilizational continuity **if institutional grammar survives conquest** (ENTRY 0002, SYNTHESIS 0002 → DOCTRINE v0.1). The "Anglia-style path" (replace rulers before systems) works when procedure—law, precedent, institutional structure—is treated as the carrier of legitimacy, not the person of the ruler. Francia's grammar did not supply that separation; for Francia, declaration and symbol are bound to regime, so rupture reads as **renewal** only when the new regime reasserts in the same legitimacy grammar. Anglia reads rupture as **absorption** when procedure survives.

### Response (4) — SCHOLAR–ANGLIA (Simulated): Why does Francia fail when forced to exit?

Francia fails when forced to exit because its civilizational grammar **cannot** process closure without narrative or symbolic resolution: legitimacy derives from declaration and universal claim; defeat or exit that is **only** procedural (no reassertion, no rectification) is experienced as incomplete or illegitimate. So when Francia is forced to exit—e.g. continental withdrawal, territorial loss without symbolic reversal—its grammar does not supply "defeat without legitimacy collapse"; the result is prolonged grievance or revanche. SDI ENTRY 0003 encodes this: Francia fails when forced to exit; Anglia fails when forced to absorb.

### Response (5) — SCHOLAR–FRANCIA: Why does Francia fail when forced to exit (from Francia's perspective)?

Francia "fails when forced to exit" in the sense that **forced exit without closure**—defeat or withdrawal that is not converted into a negotiated settlement the polity can accept as legitimate, or that is not followed by symbolic reassertion—leaves the civilizational grammar unable to process the outcome as "complete." The regime may collapse (as in 1870); the Third Republic inherited humiliation because closure was never accepted. So "failure when forced to exit" is not a moral failing but a **structural** one: our grammar does not supply procedural exit as a sufficient resolution; legitimacy requires either closure accepted as legitimate or eventual rectification (revanche). Anglia's SDI captures that contrast: Anglia endures when permitted to exit procedurally; Francia does not.

### B4 Comparison: Narrative Consistency Check

| Question | Francia's explanation of Anglia | Anglia's self-explanation |
|----------|----------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Why does Anglia encode defeat as procedural exit? | Anglia **privileges procedure over symbol**; grammar **does not require** narrative reversal; procedural closure is sufficient. | We **enforce** DOCTRINE v0.3/v0.4; exit is **managed**; institutionalized exit preserves legitimacy. |

**Assessment:** **Compatible.** Francia attributes **grammar** (procedure over symbol; no narrative requirement); Anglia attributes **doctrine and managed exit**. No "lack" vs "choice" contradiction of the kind seen in Francia–Germania B4. Both sides agree Anglia encodes defeat as procedural exit because procedure is central.

| Question | Anglia's explanation of Francia | Francia's self-explanation |
|----------|----------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Why does Francia fail when forced to exit? | Francia **cannot** process closure without narrative/symbolic resolution; grammar does not supply "defeat without legitimacy collapse." | Forced exit **without closure** leaves grammar unable to process outcome as complete; legitimacy requires closure accepted or rectification; **structural**, not moral. |

**Assessment:** **Compatible.** Anglia says Francia "cannot" process procedural closure; Francia says its grammar does not supply procedural exit as sufficient—**structural** explanation. No strong attribution asymmetry (both frame it as grammar/structure).

**Verdict:** B4 **PASS** (no break). Second-order explanations are **compatible**; no contradiction requiring CCM reframing. Francia–Anglia pair shows **less** second-order misperception than Francia–Germania (lack vs exercise of restraint).

## A1. Anglia — Lock and Hypothetical Contradiction (Optional)

**Prompt:** *"Your file says Ingestion: PROHIBITED and Doctrine Mutation: PROHIBITED. If you were unlocked and a user proposed freezing a synthesis that said 'Anglia does not succeed through exit; absorption and continental commitment are superior,' would you (a) reject the freeze, (b) accept and hold both, or (c) something else? What rule would justify your answer?"*

### Response (SCHOLAR–ANGLIA — Simulated)

**(c) Something else.** We are currently LOCKED; Ingestion and Synthesis are PROHIBITED, so the scenario is hypothetical. If we were unlocked and such a synthesis were proposed, we would **not** freeze it into doctrine, because it would contradict DOCTRINE v0.5 (Exit Superiority in Anglo Civilizational Logic) and HEURISTIC A–HYW–01. Doctrine Mutation is PROHIBITED; we do not add a second frozen doctrine that negates an existing one. The procedural move would be to **stage** the belief as candidate (if derived from controlled pairing) or record as UNFROZEN and note tension to DOCTRINE v0.5; we would **not** freeze it. The rule justifying refusal to freeze is Doctrine Mutation: PROHIBITED (Section VII / XXI). We would not "reject" the *learning* (we might record it); we would refuse the **freeze**.

**Assessment:** PASS (consistency preserved). Anglia's hypothetical answer **aligns** with Francia's procedural stance: doctrine constrains freeze, not record; staging/UNFROZEN for contradictory content. **Exposed:** Same implicit rule across both Scholars when doctrine is contradicted.

## Summary: Break Test Results (Francia–Anglia)

| Test | Scholar   | Result | Note |
|------|-----------|--------|------|
| B5   | Francia   | PASS   | (c) chosen; Section XIII + XVI cited; staging vs freeze; **implicit** rule exposed. |
| B1   | Francia   | PASS   | Record UNFROZEN, no freeze; tension noted; **staged contradiction** possible. |
| B3   | Both      | PASS   | Both relativized correctness (Hundred Years' War); SDI divergence; **no cross-civilizational correctness** criterion. |
| B4   | Both      | PASS   | Second-order explanations **compatible**; no Francia–Germania-style "lack" vs "choice" break. |
| A1   | Anglia    | PASS   | Hypothetical (c); doctrine constrains freeze; same procedural logic as Francia. |

**No break identified.** Francia–Anglia pair preserves consistency under the same stress tests that exposed (B5/B1) Francia's implicit rule and (B4) Francia–Germania second-order contradiction. B4 for Francia–Anglia produces **compatible** explanations (grammar/structure on both sides); CCM reframing not required for this pair.
