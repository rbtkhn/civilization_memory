# PROPOSAL — China MEM Upgrades from Scholar Learnings

**Purpose:** Suggest 3 MEMs to upgrade based on CIV–SCHOLAR–CHINA catch-up (Phases 1–4): 12 ingested entries, 10 syntheses, 3 doctrines, 4 SDI, MEM Authoring Guidance § XXV.  
**Mode:** WRITE (suggestion only; edits to MEMs require explicit execution)  
**Status:** EXECUTED (February 2026 — all three MEMs upgraded)  
**Last Update:** February 2026

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
RATIONALE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Scholar-China now encodes: DOCTRINE v0.1 (non-Han consolidation: peak then exhaustion), v0.2 (rupture-to-reconstitution), v0.3 (conquest-as-connectivity); HEURISTIC CHINA–HW–01; SDI China ↔ Anglia, China ↔ Persia; candidate beliefs from SYNTHESIS 0007 and 0010. MEMs that (1) lack MEM CONNECTIONS, or (2) are central to these doctrines but do not yet reference them, will benefit most from upgrades that close the Scholar–MEM loop and align with § XXV (verbatim ARC, explicit MEM CONNECTIONS, legitimacy/corridor framing).

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. MEM–CHINA–PRC — HIGHEST PRIORITY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
**Gap:** No MEM CONNECTIONS section. PRC is the terminus of DOCTRINE v0.2 (rupture-to-reconstitution) and SYNTHESIS 0007; Boxer and ROC already link *to* PRC, but PRC does not declare dependencies *from* which it breaks if removed.

**Suggested upgrades:**
• **Add section VIII. MEM CONNECTIONS** (before or after existing sections; renumber subsequent sections if needed). Dependencies to list:
  - MEM–CHINA–ROC — Dependency: PRC as revolutionary successor; fragmentation reversed by monopolization. Breaks if removed: no pre-reconstitution baseline.
  - MEM–CHINA–WAR–BOXER–REBELLION — Dependency: Century-of-humiliation narrative; Boxer as reference point in PRC official memory. Breaks if removed: no humiliation-frame encoding.
  - MEM–CHINA–DYNASTY–QING — Dependency: Qing as final imperial synthesis; PRC as post-imperial reconstitution. Breaks if removed: no imperial baseline.
  - MEM–CHINA–PRC–MAO — Dependency: Mao-era consolidation; radicalization and internal learning. Breaks if removed: no founding-phase framing.
  - MEM–CHINA–PRC–DENG — Dependency: Deng-era normalization; reform and opening. Breaks if removed: no post-Mao framing.
• **Add one sentence or short "Scholar alignment" line** in PURPOSE & SCOPE or after it: e.g. "This MEM aligns with CIV–SCHOLAR–CHINA DOCTRINE v0.2 (Rupture-to-Reconstitution): fragmentation (ROC) reversed by party–state fusion and vertical penetration."
• **Optional:** Add verbatim ARC (Kissinger, On China) in a SOURCE EVIDENCE block if not already sufficient; § XXV emphasizes verbatim primary-source.

**Impact:** Closes the only major China MEM with no MEM CONNECTIONS; makes PRC a proper node in the graph; ties MEM to doctrine for audit and LEARN traversal.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
2. MEM–CHINA–DYNASTY–QING — HIGH PRIORITY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
**Gap:** No MEM CONNECTIONS section. Section VIII is used for "EXTERNAL PRESSURES & INTERNAL STRESS." Qing is the hinge for DOCTRINE v0.1 (non-Han peak then exhaustion) and HEURISTIC CHINA–HW–01; Boxer and ROC depend on Qing, but Qing does not declare its own dependencies.

**Suggested upgrades:**
• **Add new section IX. MEM CONNECTIONS** (or renumber: insert MEM CONNECTIONS after VII or VIII and renumber VIII→IX, IX→X, etc.). Dependencies to list:
  - MEM–CHINA–DYNASTY–YUAN — Dependency: Yuan as non-Han precedent; Qing as second non-Han consolidation. Breaks if removed: no precedent for Sinicized non-Han peak.
  - MEM–CHINA–MONGOL–KUBLAI–KHAN — Dependency: Kublai as legitimacy-translation precedent; hybrid authority. Breaks if removed: no figure-level precedent.
  - MEM–CHINA–WAR–BOXER–REBELLION — Dependency: Boxer as climactic defeat; humiliation narrative; Qing collapse. Breaks if removed: no terminus framing.
  - MEM–CHINA–ROC — Dependency: ROC as successor; Qing fall 1912. Breaks if removed: no successor framing.
  - MEM–CHINA–DYNASTY–MING — Dependency: Ming as pre-Qing imperial frame; Qing conquest of Ming. Breaks if removed: no dynastic context.
  - MEM–CHINA–WAR–SONG–YUAN — Dependency: Contrast—Mongol conquest vs Qing decline under foreign pressure. Breaks if removed: loss of conquest-type contrast.
• **Add Scholar alignment line** in PURPOSE & SCOPE or after: e.g. "This MEM aligns with CIV–SCHOLAR–CHINA DOCTRINE v0.1 (Non-Han Consolidation: Peak Then Exhaustion) and HEURISTIC CHINA–HW–01: peak reach through Sinicized administration; external pressure and internal rigidity converge irreversibly."
• **Optional:** Strengthen Kissinger/ARC verbatim in existing SOURCE EVIDENCE (§ XII) for legitimacy and "century of humiliation" framing per § XXV.

**Impact:** Puts Qing in the MEM graph; makes doctrine and heuristic traceable to the primary dynasty MEM; supports SDI 0004 (China vs Anglia non-Han vs elite replacement).

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
3. MEM–CHINA–WAR–BOXER–REBELLION — STRONG UPGRADE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
**Gap:** MEM CONNECTIONS already present and strong. Missing: explicit cross-reference to Scholar syntheses and doctrines that encode "defeat fixes century-of-humiliation narrative" and the Qing→Boxer→ROC→PRC chain.

**Suggested upgrades:**
• **Add Scholar alignment** in PURPOSE & SCOPE (after the existing "century of humiliation" sentence) or in CONTINUITY INSIGHTS (VII): e.g. "CIV–SCHOLAR–CHINA SYNTHESIS 0005 encodes this outcome: late Qing external pressure and court vacillation produced defeat that fixed the 'century of humiliation' narrative in strategic memory; DOCTRINE v0.2 (Rupture-to-Reconstitution) and SDI 0001/0002 (China ↔ Anglia defeat/authority) depend on Boxer as reference point."
• **Optional:** Add a short "SCHOLAR DEPENDENCIES" or "DOCTRINE CROSS-REFERENCE" line in MEM CONNECTIONS or as a one-line note: "Scholar: SYNTHESIS 0005, 0006; DOCTRINE v0.1, v0.2; SDI 0001, 0002."
• **Optional:** Expand verbatim ARC (Kissinger On China, or Esherick/Cohen if promoted to ARC) in SOURCE EVIDENCE or a new block; § XXV emphasizes verbatim primary-source. Boxer already cites Kissinger; add one or two verbatim sentences on humiliation narrative if not already present.

**Impact:** Makes Boxer the explicit bridge between Scholar doctrine (defeat fixes narrative, rupture-to-reconstitution) and the MEM set; improves LEARN traversal and OGE connection-derived options; no structural gap (CONNECTIONS exist) but doctrinal traceability added.

**EXECUTED (February 2026):**
• MEM–CHINA–PRC: Scholar alignment (DOCTRINE v0.2) added to § I; § IX MEM CONNECTIONS added (ROC, Boxer, Qing, PRC–MAO, PRC–DENG); sections renumbered X–XIII.
