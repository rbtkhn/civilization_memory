# Cognitive-Linguistic Authenticity Audit: MIND–MERCOURIS

**Classification:** SYSTEM mode audit  
**Date:** 2026-02-12  
**Source:** Full clean transcript of Alexander Mercouris program, Thursday 12 February 2026 (Middle East/Iran, Ukraine, Epstein, oil/Hormuz)  
**Reference:** cmc-mercouris-voice.mdc, CIV–MIND–MERCOURIS  

---

## I. Purpose

To compare the **actual linguistic and cognitive patterns** in Mercouris's real-world program transcript against the MIND–MERCOURIS profile and cursor rule (cmc-mercouris-voice.mdc), and to identify: (a) markers that are authenticated by this transcript; (b) markers present in the transcript but missing or underweighted in the rule; (c) cognitive patterns (legitimacy, attribution, scope) as enacted in program mode.

## II. Transcript-Derived Linguistic Inventory

### A. Opening / Framing (Actual in Transcript)

- **Date/topic opener:** "Good day. Today is Thursday, February 12, 2026, and the situation connected to the Middle East is intensifying." (Rule does not list date/topic as canonical opener; rule favours "It seems to me" or "Well, as we start today...".)
- **Difficulty/precision immediately:** "It's very difficult, or almost impossible, to distinguish fact from rumor because..."
- **"But let me repeat again that..."** — recursive, returning to prior claim.
- **"Anyway, this informant told me..."** — transition + attribution. "Anyway" appears **very frequently** (20+ times) as transition and scope reset.
- **"So this activity does seem to be taking place."** — hedged assertion after evidence.
- **"And well, as a number of people—Yves Smith at Naked Capitalism—have been pointing out..."** — attribution to named source.

**Verdict:** Rule's "Well, as we start today, there are...—in fact, no, not [X], [Y]—..." is a good fit for self-correction; transcript uses date + topic then **difficulty/precision** ("very difficult to distinguish"). Add: **date/topic then difficulty** as valid program opener.

### B. Epistemic Hedging (Heavy in Transcript)

Repeated throughout:

- "It's very difficult to say exactly what the case is"
- "it does seem as if this time some of these reports are true"
- "I believe, by the way, these are air defense troops"
- "I've seen no evidence that this is the case"
- "I think it is more likely that..."
- "it is likely that this launch has provided..."
- "perhaps and better capable"
- "So I assume that the United States is aware..."
- "it could be that..."
- "I believe—I may be wrong—but I believe that..."
- "I'm not an expert on this but I presume..."
- "To my mind, an extreme demand"
- "I don't believe that the Iranians are ever going to agree"
- "I think that they will almost certainly fight"
- "as far as I'm aware"
- "I can come up with no other explanation than that..."
- "That it seems to me is the only explanation"
- "We—I am not sure." / "I'm not sure whether..." / "I am not sure that any final decision..."
- "It may also be that..."
- "I get the impression"
- "It may be that..."
- "I'm going to make a guess that..."
- "I of course do not know"
- "I would have thought that..."
- "Perhaps some of us would say that it is even plausible"
- "I would absolutely not be surprised"
- "it seems to me that the Russians are still testing..."
- "I find the explanations Pam Bondi gave completely incredible"
- "to me that sounds absolutely bizarre to the point of being extraordinary"
- "Personally, I think it is highly likely that..."

**Verdict:** Rule's epistemic hedging list is **authenticated**. Transcript adds: **"I believe—I may be wrong—but I believe that..."**, **"To my mind,"**, **"I get the impression,"**, **"I would have thought that..."**, **"to me that sounds..."**, **"I find ... completely incredible"**. These should be added to the rule as transcript-derived.

### C. Scope Limitation / Deferral (Heavy in Transcript)

- "I'm not going to get into the details of that"
- "that's another story. I'm not going to get into the details of that"
- "I'm not going to get into a discussion about the success of this counteroffensive or otherwise"
- "I'm not going to discuss in any detail on this program"
- "I have only skimmed through some of the document dump"
- "I'm not going to anticipate what they are. I don't know what they are but I am sure that they're coming"

**Verdict:** Rule already has "I'm not going to get into the details of this now" and "Now I am not going to explore in this program why...". Transcript **confirms** and adds **"I'm not going to discuss in any detail on this program"** and **"that's another story. I'm not going to get into..."**.

### D. Phrases in Transcript NOT in Rule (Gaps)

| Phrase / pattern | Frequency in transcript | Suggested rule addition |
|------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|
| **"Just saying."** | Multiple (scope limiter, modest claim) | Add under Deferral/scope: "Just saying." (dismisses or limits claim without elaborating) |
| **"For the record,"** | Multiple | Add under Precision/scope: "For the record," (narrow or correct a claim) |
| **"By the way,"** | Very frequent | Already in rule as transition; transcript confirms central role |
| **"I have to say" / "I have to add"** | Several | Add under Qualified acknowledgment or Precision: "I have to say that..."; "I would just however add that..." |
| **"My key point is, however, that..."** | Once (replaces "The crucial point, surely, is" in this program) | Add as variant of "The crucial point, surely, is" for program voice |
| **"To repeat again,"** | Multiple | Add under Recursive/returning |
| **Self-correction mid-sentence** | e.g. "Huliaipole is about to fall—no, wait, Huliaipole is already taken; I meant another village..." | Rule has "in fact, no, not [X], [Y]"; transcript confirms and extends to full self-correction clause |
| **"I find [X] completely incredible" / "I find this article ... totally absurd"** | Strong hedged assessment | Add under Hedged puzzlement: "I find [claim] completely incredible" / "totally absurd" (first-person assessment, not rhetorical assault) |

---

### E. Attribution (Heavy in Transcript)

- Private source: "this informant told me," "the same person who regularly provides me with...", "this source has informed me," "The latest information—which does not come from this source, by the way"
- Named analysts: "Yves Smith at Naked Capitalism," "Larry Johnson at Sonar21," "Eli Lake and by Jennifer Kavanagh in Responsible Statecraft," "Raidovka," "Yves Smith... in which he discusses..."
- Prior programs: "as I discussed in my program yesterday," "I discussed this in an earlier program," "I've discussed this in previous programs"
- Documents/reports: "report in Bloomberg," "articles... in the New York Times," "document dump"

**Verdict:** Rule's attribution section is **authenticated**. Transcript shows **tiered attribution** (private source vs named analyst vs prior program vs document). Add: **"which does not come from this source, by the way"** (source qualification) and **"as I discussed in my program yesterday"** (already in rule).

---

### F. Non-Closure / Conclusion

- "Anyway, we shall see"
- "We'll see what comes of these talks"
- "we shall see what the decisions are"
- "I am not saying that the Iranians should rely upon it"
- "We have to be careful when discussing all of this"
- "we can't be sure that we aren't seeing... exactly the same thing"
- "I may be wrong. I hope I am, but..."

**Verdict:** Rule's non-closure list is **authenticated**. Transcript adds: **"We have to be careful when discussing all of this"** and **"we can't be sure that we aren't seeing..."** (explicit epistemic caution).

---

### G. Recursive / Returning

- "to repeat again"
- "Now I come back to the information I got from the source"
- "I go back to those articles that I discussed in my program yesterday"
- "returning to this topic"
- "So anyway, that is Zelensky"
- "What I do want to turn attention to is..."
- "So I just wanted to set it all out in one further place"

**Verdict:** Rule's recursive markers are **authenticated**. Add: **"To repeat again,"**, **"I go back to..."**, **"What I do want to turn attention to is..."**, **"So I just wanted to set it all out..."**.

---

## III. Cognitive Patterns in Transcript

- **Legitimacy / institutional continuity:** Present but not dominant. Negotiation vs attack, Trump's preference for negotiations, Lavrov's complaints about American backtracking on Anchorage, documents withheld—all touch on **procedure, commitments, and institutional behavior**. Not framed explicitly as "legitimacy density"; more "what was promised, what was done, who is reneging."
- **Attribution as primary move:** The program is **source-heavy**: private informant, Larry Johnson, Yves Smith, Jennifer Kavanagh, Eli Lake, Raidovka, Lavrov, NYT, Bloomberg. He repeatedly **limits claim to source** ("which does not come from this source, by the way," "I've seen no evidence").
- **Precision / self-correction:** "Perhaps I should be more precise and say that the cupboard of Patriot air defense missiles appears to be bare"; "which by the way I understand as it happens is not one of the rare earths"; mid-sentence correction on Huliaipole. **Strong** match to rule's self-correction/precision.
- **Scope:** Heavy use of "I'm not going to...," "Just saying," "For the record," "that's another story." **Strong** match.
- **Hedged puzzlement / assessment:** "I find the explanations Pam Bondi gave completely incredible"; "to me that sounds absolutely bizarre"; "Jared Kushner's presence... is a complete puzzle to me." Uses **first-person** assessment, not "How could anybody...?" — **correct** per rule.
- **Non-closure:** "Anyway, we shall see"; "I am not saying that the Iranians should rely upon it"; "We can't be sure that we aren't seeing... exactly the same thing." **Strong** match.

**Verdict:** In **program/breaking-news** mode, Mercouris leads with **attribution + difficulty + precision** and **scope limits**; legitimacy and institutional continuity appear **through** the material (negotiations, documents, who keeps promises) rather than as an opening frame. The rule's **academic prose** (LEARN/WRITE) may lead with "The crucial point, surely, is legitimacy..." — that is appropriate for MEM/SCHOLAR. For **IMAGINE / spoken program** mode, the rule should explicitly endorse **date/topic + difficulty** and **attribution-first** as equally authentic openings.

## IV. Rule vs Transcript — Summary Table

| Rule element | In transcript? | Note |
|--------------|----------------|------|
| "It seems to me..." | Yes, frequent | Authenticated |
| "The crucial point, surely, is" | No (uses "My key point is, however") | Add variant |
| "Anyway,..." | Yes, very frequent | Authenticated |
| "I'm not going to speculate / get into..." | Yes | Authenticated |
| "as I discussed in my program yesterday" | Yes | Authenticated |
| Attribution (Larry Johnson, Jennifer Kavanagh, etc.) | Yes, heavy | Authenticated |
| "Anyway, we shall see" | Yes | Authenticated |
| "I find it difficult to understand why" / "it bewilders me" | Partial ("complete puzzle to me," "I find ... incredible") | Add "I find ... completely incredible"; "is a complete puzzle to me" |
| "Just saying" | Yes, multiple | **Missing from rule — add** |
| "For the record" | Yes, multiple | **Missing from rule — add** |
| "I believe—I may be wrong—but I believe that..." | Yes | **Add to rule** |
| "To repeat again" | Yes | **Add to rule** |
| "I have to say" / "I would just however add that..." | Yes | **Add to rule** |
| Date/topic opener | Yes (Good day. Today is [date]...) | **Add for IMAGINE/program mode** |
| Self-correction mid-sentence | Yes (Huliaipole—no, wait...) | Extend rule example |

## V. Recommendations

1. **Add to cmc-mercouris-voice.mdc (Transcript-Derived Markers or new subsection):**
   - **Scope/dismiss:** "Just saying." (limits or dismisses claim without elaboration)
   - **Precision:** "For the record," (narrow or correct claim)
   - **Qualified claim:** "I believe—I may be wrong—but I believe that..."
   - **Returning:** "To repeat again,"; "I go back to..."; "What I do want to turn attention to is..."; "So I just wanted to set it all out..."
   - **Hedged assessment:** "I find [X] completely incredible"; "to me that sounds absolutely bizarre"; "[X] is a complete puzzle to me"
   - **Precision/emphasis:** "I have to say that..."; "I would just however add that..."; "My key point is, however, that..."
   - **Epistemic caution:** "We have to be careful when discussing all of this"; "we can't be sure that we aren't seeing..."
   - **Program opener (IMAGINE/spoken):** "Good day. Today is [date], and [topic]. It's very difficult to [distinguish/ say exactly]..." (date/topic then difficulty)

2. **Mode note:** In LEARN/WRITE use academic prose and may lead with legitimacy. In **IMAGINE** (spoken program) use **program-style** opener (date/topic, difficulty, attribution) and the full transcript-derived list above. Rule already says LEARN/WRITE = academic prose; IMAGINE = spoken (program-style). This audit **confirms** that program-style is attribution-heavy, scope-heavy, and "Just saying" / "For the record" are authentic.

3. **Self-check:** Add optional bullet: "In IMAGINE/program mode: date/topic opener or attribution opener? Scope limit ('Just saying,' 'For the record,' 'I'm not going to...')?"

4. **No change** to civilizational grammar or contrast with Mearsheimer/Barnes; transcript does not use "The fact is..." as opener or "Who in the heck...?" — **compliant**.

---

## VI. Conclusion

The transcript **strongly authenticates** the existing Mercouris rule (hedging, attribution, scope, non-closure, recursive return, hedged puzzlement). It also surfaces **gaps**: "Just saying," "For the record," "I believe—I may be wrong—but I believe that...", "To repeat again," "I find ... completely incredible," "My key point is, however, that...", and program opener (date/topic + difficulty). Adding these to the rule will improve **cognitive-linguistic authenticity** for IMAGINE and for any spoken or program-style Mercouris output.
