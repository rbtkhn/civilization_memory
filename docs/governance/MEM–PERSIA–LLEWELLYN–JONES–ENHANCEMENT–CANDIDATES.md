# MEM–PERSIA Enhancement Candidates — Llewellyn-Jones Verbatim Quotes

**STATUS: INTEGRATED (February 2026)** — All HIGH and MEDIUM priority MEMs upgraded to v1.1 with Llewellyn-Jones FiveBooks interview quotes. See VERSION–MANIFEST.

**NEW MEMs (February 2026)** — Six MEMs created from Llewellyn-Jones *Persians* chapter structure; several already include Llewellyn-Jones quotes (Darius I, Xerxes, Persepolis, Egypt). Future enhancement: extract verbatim book quotes for Darius I "When bureaucrats ruled the world," Xerxes "The truth and the lie," Persepolis "Constructing majesty," Medes "The Medes and the Persians," Egypt "The sceptre of Egypt," Darius III "Some talk of Alexander."

**Source:** Lloyd Llewellyn-Jones, *Persians: The Age of the Great Kings* (2022) — CIV–ARC–PERSIA v1.2 (ARC-T-MODERN)  
**Purpose:** Identify existing MEM–PERSIA files that could be enhanced by adding Llewellyn-Jones verbatim quotes  
**Note:** Verbatim book quotes require extraction from *Persians* (2022). FiveBooks interview (2020) provides attributed interview quotes below.

## HIGH-PRIORITY CANDIDATES

### 1. MEM–PERSIA–CYRUS–I

**Thematic fit:** Cyrus as integrative conqueror; propaganda/liberation; Cyrus Cylinder; Babylonian conquest; tolerance rhetoric; tribal confederacy.

**Suggested placement:** Section III (Imperial Expansion) or IV (Sovereignty & Legitimacy)

**Interview quote (FiveBooks, 2020) — usable with ARC–DISCOVERY or if interview is admissible:**
> "Cyrus played very carefully to different audiences and I think that propaganda is one of the real successes of the Persian Empire. It was built on this idea of liberation, even though it really wasn't. I always think of George Bush, when he first went into Iraq in the first Gulf War. He called it 'Operation Iraqi Freedom'. I think we can call Cyrus's Babylon campaign 'Operation Babylonian Freedom' in the same kind of way."

**Book quote target:** *Persians* ch. on Babylon conquest, Cyrus Cylinder—liberation rhetoric, Marduk blessing. Extract verbatim from text.

**Enhancement rationale:** MEM–PERSIA–CYRUS–I currently has no modern ARC quote; Llewellyn-Jones supplies "Persian version" framing for integrative conquest and propaganda.

---

### 2. MEM–PERSIA–DYNASTY–ACHAEMENID

**Thematic fit:** Satrapal administration; *laisser-faire* governance; local systems preserved; tribute over homogenization; Persian vs Roman/British imperial model.

**Suggested placement:** Section III (Territorial Scale & Satrapal Design) or V (Military & Logistical Foundations — cavalry)

**Interview quote (FiveBooks, 2020):**
> "The Persians never did that. They adopted a more *laisser-faire* attitude and, as long as the tribute and the taxes came in, then they did not interfere with local systems. In fact, they encouraged the Persian satraps to work with local dynasts to keep the preexisting systems going."

**Cavalry quote (Interview):**
> "On Darius the Great's tomb inscription it says: 'I am as great a bowman as a spearman; I'm as great a spearman as a horseman; I am a great horseman.' It's those three things that set the Persians apart. You might have heard of the so-called 'Parthian shot'..."

**Book quote target:** *Persians* Part II "Being Persian" — bureaucracy, satraps; Part I — imperial administration. Extract verbatim.

**Enhancement rationale:** MEM–PERSIA–DYNASTY–ACHAEMENID has no verbatim modern quotes; Llewellyn-Jones reinforces "modular governance" and Persian distinctiveness.

---

### 3. MEM–PERSIA–WAR–ALEXANDER

**Thematic fit:** Alexander as system exploit; Greek/Persian encoding divergence; Marathon as minor to Persians; "Persian version" of conquest.

**Suggested placement:** Section I (Memory Purpose) or II (Achaemenid Baseline) — framing Greek-centric vs Persian encoding.

**Interview quote (FiveBooks, 2020):**
> "I've managed to write the Battle of Marathon in a sentence and a half, for instance. It was of very little consequence to the Persians."

**Book quote target:** *Persians* "Some talk of Alexander" — Persian perspective on conquest; empire in decline question (Llewellyn-Jones: answer was 'no'). Extract verbatim.

**Enhancement rationale:** MEM–PERSIA–WAR–ALEXANDER emphasizes Persian encoding; Llewellyn-Jones provides explicit "decolonizing" / anti-Eurocentric framing.

---

### 4. MEM–PERSIA–WAR–CARRHAE

**Thematic fit:** Parthian cavalry; Persian horsemanship tradition; "Parthian shot" — continuity from Achaemenid to Parthian.

**Suggested placement:** Section III (Parthian Warfare — Mobility as Doctrine)

**Interview quote (FiveBooks, 2020) — Darius tomb, applies to Persian military tradition:**
> "It's those three things that set the Persians apart. You might have heard of the so-called 'Parthian shot', for instance, where a rider could turn at 90 degrees and fire arrows behind him so he could circle his enemies. It was the tactics of the cavalry more than anything else that won the Persians their victories."

**Book quote target:** *Persians* — any passage on Persian cavalry, equestrian tradition, or continuity to Parthian period. Extract verbatim.

**Enhancement rationale:** MEM–PERSIA–WAR–CARRHAE has Strabo, Herodotus, Plutarch; Llewellyn-Jones adds modern synthesis of cavalry as Persian constant.

---

### 5. MEM–PERSIA–ZOROASTER

**Thematic fit:** "Also sprach Zarathustra" chapter in *Persians*; Zoroastrianism and court ideology; Truth/Lie (Asha/Druj); Persian historical memory via oral tradition.

**Suggested placement:** Section II (Cosmic Dualism) or V (Institutional Transmission)

**Interview quote (FiveBooks, 2020) — on Persian historical memory:**
> "They just remembered it differently. And I think the way in which they used, or activated their history, was through poetry, through song, what Parry and Lord identified as 'the oral tradition'. So, I think that, if we were to look for a Persian history, it would be more akin to a Homeric epic, than an 'inquiry' in the Herodotean style."

**Book quote target:** *Persians* ch. "Also sprach Zarathustra" — Zoroastrianism and kingship. Extract verbatim.

**Enhancement rationale:** MEM–PERSIA–ZOROASTER has no modern ARC quote; Llewellyn-Jones addresses Zoroaster's place in court culture.

---

## MEDIUM-PRIORITY CANDIDATES

### 6. MEM–PERSIA–WAR–ROME

**Thematic fit:** Persian vs Roman encoding; "sophisticated and cultured" vs orientalist stereotype; endurance doctrine.

**Interview quote (FiveBooks, 2020):**
> "We have to right that wrong. We have to show that the Persians and other easterners were sophisticated and cultured, embracing, thoughtful and scientific—all the things that a harmful brand of Orientalism says that they're not."

**Enhancement rationale:** Civilizational contrast; reinforces MEM's "parity war" and encoding divergence.

---

### 7. MEM–PERSIA–EMPIRE–ARDASHIR–I

**Thematic fit:** Achaemenid restoration ideology; Persian continuity; "Persian version" of dynastic overthrow.

**Book quote target:** *Persians* Epilogue "Persian past; Iranian present" — reception of pre-Islamic past; Cyrus in modern Iran. Ardashir invokes Achaemenid restoration.

**Enhancement rationale:** Llewellyn-Jones on reception and restoration narrative could support Ardashir's ideological claims.
