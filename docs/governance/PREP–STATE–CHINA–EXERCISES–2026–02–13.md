# PREP — Exercises and Challenges for Generating CIV–STATE–CHINA

**Date:** 2026-02-13  
**Purpose:** Prepare the system and operator to generate CIV–STATE–CHINA from CIV–CORE–CHINA, CIV–SCHOLAR–CHINA, CIV–DOCTRINE–CHINA, and the MEM–CHINA corpus.  
**Authority:** CIV–STATE–TEMPLATE v3.3, cmc-state-mem-grounding, CIV–MEM–CORE

---

## I. PREREQUISITE GAP

**MEM–RELEVANCE–CHINA does not exist.**  
STATE mode MEM SCAN requires dimension-based lookup via MEM–RELEVANCE–[CIV].md. Without it, Decision Points, Stability Watch, and Scenario Tree cannot perform the mandatory MEM SCAN step (or must rely only on Section VII fallback and connection discovery from a small seed set). **Creating MEM–RELEVANCE–CHINA is a blocking prerequisite** for full STATE–CHINA operation.

---

## II. EXERCISES (DO IN ORDER)

### Exercise 1 — Create MEM–RELEVANCE–CHINA

**Objective:** Build the dimension index that maps STATE-relevant analytical dimensions to MEM–CHINA files.

**Steps:**
1. List the **analytical dimensions** that will recur in STATE–CHINA. Derive them from:
   - CIV–CORE–CHINA mandatory outputs (MSI, PLS, SOC, EAL, AT, LCF, IRR, EAC, Compute Sovereignty, Spatial Integrity, Escalation Stability, EPV, Time Advantage, Axis Optionality, SAF-CH, GRID-CH, RIR-CH)
   - CIV–DOCTRINE–CHINA (01 Non-Han peak/exhaustion, 02 Rupture-to-reconstitution, 03 Conquest-as-connectivity)
   - Recurring decision spaces (e.g. Taiwan, tech sovereignty, internal stability, cross-strait, alliance vs exit)
2. For each dimension, assign **primary** and **secondary** MEMs from CIV–INDEX–CHINA (69 files). Use MEM CONNECTIONS and subject matter (dynasty, war, GEO, regime, figure) to rank relevance.
3. Follow the structure of MEM–RELEVANCE–RUSSIA or MEM–RELEVANCE–AMERICA: Purpose, How to Use, then sections I, II, III, … per dimension, with one-line relevance and optional concept tags per MEM.

**Suggested dimensions (to be refined):**  
Legitimacy / Mandate Stability • Fiscal / Industrial Pressure • Internal Order / Elite Alignment • Maritime / Spatial Integrity • Settlement Precedent / Diplomatic Negotiation • Conquest / Connectivity (Mongol, corridor) • Rupture / Reconstitution (ROC–PRC) • Opponent Constraint (if principal opponent is defined) • Cross-Entity (e.g. US–China, China–Russia).

**Success criterion:** Every STATE session activity that runs a MEM SCAN can use MEM–RELEVANCE–CHINA to load at least 2 primary MEMs per relevant dimension and 1 from each additional dimension.

---

### Exercise 2 — CORE Diagnostic → Material Option Mapping

**Objective:** Ensure each CORE–CHINA diagnostic (and doctrine) can be tied to at least one material option or stability indicator.

**Steps:**
1. Read CIV–CORE–CHINA Sections I–XX. List every **MANDATORY OUTPUT** (MSI, PLS, SOC, EAL, AT, LCF, IRR, EAC, Compute Sovereignty, Spatial Integrity, Escalation Stability, Internal Stability, Narrative Control, Time Advantage, EPV, Axis Optionality, SAF-CH, THI-CH, GRID-CH, RIR-CH).
2. For each, write one sentence: “This indicator is **binding** for material option X when [condition].”
3. Draft 3–5 **Material Options** (Section IV style) for China. For each option, assign the single **binding constraint** from CORE that would make that option invalid or non-viable if violated. Use CIV–STATE–TEMPLATE § IV structure (option label, summary, assumptions, binding constraint, evidence placeholder).
4. Cross-check: do CIV–DOCTRINE–CHINA 01–03 imply any **hard constraints** that should appear as binding constraints on options (e.g. “Doctrine 02: reconstitution requires monopolization; option ‘Constitutional reform as path to legitimacy’ is invalid if party–state fusion is non-negotiable”)?

**Success criterion:** No CORE mandatory output is orphaned; every material option has an explicit binding constraint; doctrines are reflected where they constrain options.

---

### Exercise 3 — MEM-Grounded Parallel (Read, Don’t Label)

**Objective:** Practice the MEM SCAN discipline: **read** MEM files and **extract specific details** (dates, mechanisms, actors, outcomes); avoid citing MEMs by name only (“label”).

**Steps:**
1. Pick a decision space (e.g. “cross-strait escalation” or “internal stability under economic stress”).
2. From MEM–RELEVANCE–CHINA (once it exists) or from CIV–INDEX–CHINA, choose 2 MEMs that are clearly relevant (e.g. MEM–CHINA–WAR–SONG–YUAN, MEM–CHINA–PRC).
3. **Read** both MEMs in full. Note: exact dates, named actors, mechanisms (e.g. “naval and riverine capacity as condition for conquest”), sequences (“X then Y then Z”), and outcomes.
4. Write a **single paragraph** of “Decision-Relevant History” that uses **only** details you extracted from those two MEMs. No general knowledge. No MEM name as decoration—the reader should learn what happened and why it matters for the decision space.
5. Repeat for a second decision space and two different MEMs.

**Success criterion:** A reviewer cannot tell which MEMs you used without your footnote; the paragraph is analytically useful (mechanism + sequence + outcome), not a label.

---

### Exercise 4 — Three Perspectives in Professional Register

**Objective:** Produce one short analytical block (e.g. “Strategic position for China re: Taiwan”) in **three paragraphs**, one per perspective, using **only** content-based names and **no** system-internal terms.

**Steps:**
1. Write **Paragraph A:** Legitimacy and institutional continuity. Focus: mandate stability, narrative control, institutional continuity, legitimacy encoding. No “Mercouris,” “MIND,” “hedging.”
2. Write **Paragraph B:** Power distribution and structural constraint. Focus: force ratio, geography, alliance structure, incentive structure, relative degradation. No “Mearsheimer,” “MIND.”
3. Write **Paragraph C:** Leadership liability and mechanism. Focus: who is exposed, defection incentives, irreversibility, jurisdiction. No “Barnes,” “MIND.”
4. Self-check: Could a reader who has never seen CMC governance understand and use the three paragraphs? Are tensions between them **preserved** (not resolved)?

**Success criterion:** Register matches CIV–STATE–TEMPLATE Section XI (Translation Table); no MIND names; tensions visible.

---

### Exercise 5 — Decision Point with Accommodation/Reversal Option

**Objective:** Build a single Decision Point (X-B) option set that includes **at least one option at the accommodation/reversal end** when the decision involves a commitment.

**Steps:**
1. Define a **decision**: e.g. “Sustain vs reduce military/diplomatic commitment in the Taiwan Strait.”
2. List 5–8 **options** along a spectrum from “double down” to “exit/reverse.”
3. **Verify:** Is at least one option clearly at the **accommodation/reversal** end (e.g. de-escalation, withdrawal of presence, negotiation-first, one-China accommodation)? If not, add it and label the binding constraint and assumptions.
4. For each option, in one line each: **binding constraint** (from CORE), **key assumption**, **evidence placeholder** (what would confirm or disconfirm).

**Success criterion:** Option set passes the “commitment-weighted default” check (Template v3.3); duty of competence satisfied; Doctrine 03 (exit/retrenchment as strategic option) reflected where applicable.

---

### Exercise 6 — ARC Source Coverage (STATE Evidence)

**Objective:** When citing current-event or institutional evidence for China, use **at least two ARC source categories** and **surface contradictions** if sources disagree.

**Steps:**
1. Choose a **factual claim** relevant to STATE–CHINA (e.g. “PLA naval readiness” or “domestic consumption growth”).
2. Consult CIV–ARC–CHINA § IX-B (ARC-T-INSTITUTIONAL): pick one OFFICIAL, one RESEARCH or NEWS, and optionally one SPECIALIST source.
3. For each source, write one sentence of **claim + attribution**: “(Source: [name], ARC–CHINA–T-INSTITUTIONAL/[type]; Editorial note: [from ARC].)"
4. If two sources conflict, write **both** claims with attribution; do not silently prefer one. Add one line: “Contradiction: [A] says X; [B] says Y; decision-maker resolves.”

**Success criterion:** No single-category evidence; entity’s own official/institutional source included; contradictions visible (per cmc-arc-source-coverage).

---

### Exercise 7 — Section VII: Decision-Relevant History from SCHOLAR

**Objective:** Populate a minimal **Decision-Relevant History** (Section VII) for STATE–CHINA using patterns already in CIV–SCHOLAR–CHINA (syntheses, doctrines, SDI).

**Steps:**
1. From CIV–SCHOLAR–CHINA, list: the 3 doctrines (01–03), the 4 SDI entries (China–Anglia, China–Persia), and 2–3 unfrozen syntheses that are decision-relevant (e.g. humiliation narrative, rupture-reconstitution, conquest-connectivity).
2. For each, write one **pattern** in Section VII format: label, one-sentence summary, MEM/precedent reference, activation level (ACTIVE / STALE / WEAKENED), and “Relevance: [when this pattern applies to current decision].”
3. Ensure at least one pattern is **failure** or **reversal** (e.g. peak then exhaustion; defeat fixing humiliation narrative) so that positive and negative precedents are both present.

**Success criterion:** Section VII has 6–10 patterns; each traceable to SCHOLAR or MEM; activation levels and relevance stated.

## III. CHALLENGES (STRESS TESTS)

### Challenge 1 — Opponent Constraint (Section VI-B)

If STATE–CHINA material options depend on a **principal opponent** (e.g. United States or Taiwan), the template requires **Section VI-B: Opponent Constraint Assessment**.  
**Task:** Draft VI-B for one opponent. Include: opponent’s binding constraints, degradation trajectory, and relative position vs China’s constraints. Use ARC–CHINA and, if applicable, the opponent’s ARC for evidence. Check that **binding constraints** for material options are framed **relatively** where relevant (e.g. “does opponent degrade faster than China?”).

### Challenge 2 — Cross-Entity Link (Section VIII)

If STATE–CHINA routinely analyses US–China or China–Russia (or another pair), define at least one **Cross-Entity Link** (Section VIII): relationship type, recent dynamics, and how it affects material options. Use MEM–CHINA and, if available, the other entity’s MEM/STATE for historical depth. Optionally run a **Cross-Entity Pressure Test** (X-G) in a dry run.

### Challenge 3 — Pattern Audit Dry Run (X-H)

Before going live, run a **Pattern Audit** (X-H) on the draft Section VII: extract all patterns, check each against **current** evidence (from ARC–CHINA institutional sources), and propose activation updates (STALE / WEAKENED / ACTIVE). Ensures the framework does not silently degrade.

### Challenge 4 — Sync and Relay Readiness

**Sync:** STATE reads from CORE, SCHOLAR, DOCTRINE, MEMs. Run the **Sync Protocol** (CIV–STATE–TEMPLATE § XIV) once CIV–STATE–CHINA v0.1 exists: compare STATE to CORE–CHINA, SCHOLAR–CHINA, DOCTRINE–CHINA, and MEM–RELEVANCE–CHINA; list substantive changes; propose STATE file updates.  
**Relay:** Only “relay to scholar” transfers STATE output into SCHOLAR. Confirm you know how to **relay** a session (what to propose for CIV–SCHOLAR–CHINA and how to record the relay in the STATE file State Log).
