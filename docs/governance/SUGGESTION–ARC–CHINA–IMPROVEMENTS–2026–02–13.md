# Suggestions: Further Improvements to CIV–ARC–CHINA

**Date:** 2026-02-13  
**Context:** After v3.2 (Encyclopedia of China, Chinese-language institutional). Below are additional improvements that would strengthen accuracy, credibility, and balance.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. FIX REFERENCE VERSION IN DEPENDENTS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

**Issue:** Section VIII (Mirroring / Reference) still says CIV–CORE–CHINA and CIV–SCHOLAR–CHINA reference "CIV–ARC–CHINA v3.0". ARC is now v3.2.

**Action:** When CORE–CHINA or SCHOLAR–CHINA are next edited, update their ARC reference to v3.2. Optionally add a line in ARC Section VIII: "Dependents should reference current ARC version (as of 2026-02: v3.2)."

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
2. PRC WHITE PAPERS / STATE COUNCIL INFORMATION OFFICE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

**Issue:** Major PRC policy documents (white papers on Taiwan, human rights, defense, Xinjiang, etc.) are published by the State Council Information Office and hosted on gov.cn or dedicated sites. They are primary official statements but not explicitly called out in ARC.

**Suggestion:** Add to ARC-T-INSTITUTIONAL (OFFICIAL):
• State Council Information Office (国务院新闻办公室) / White Papers — e.g. www.scio.gov.cn or via www.gov.cn
  Authoritative For: White papers on Taiwan, human rights, defense, ethnic policy, territorial claims
  Editorial Note: PRC official policy documents; treat as official position; Chinese and English versions often both published

**Benefit:** STATE and MEMs can cite white papers explicitly when analyzing policy claims or territorial narrative.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
3. ONE MORE CHINESE-LANGUAGE RESEARCH BODY (CICIR OR SIIS)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

**Issue:** We have CASS and CIIS. The eval also mentioned CICIR (China Institute of Contemporary International Relations) and SIIS (Shanghai Institutes for International Studies) as important Chinese-language, policy-relevant research sources. Adding one would thicken coverage without clutter.

**Suggestion:** Add **one** of:
• **SIIS (Shanghai Institutes for International Studies)** — siis.org.cn. Authoritative For: Foreign policy, regional security, Shanghai perspective. Editorial Note: Shanghai-based; Chinese-primary; policy-oriented.
**or**
• **CICIR (China Institute of Contemporary International Relations)** — cicir.ac.cn. Authoritative For: Strategic and international relations research; close to security establishment. Editorial Note: Chinese-primary; signals establishment research; not always openly available.

**Benefit:** Broader Chinese-language research coverage for STATE and for MEMs that cite contemporary PRC strategic framing.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
4. ADMISSIBILITY OF MAJOR DYNASTIC HISTORIES AS NAMED WORKS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

**Issue:** MEMs (e.g. Mongol–Jin, Song–Yuan) list 《元史》《金史》《宋史》 in their Primary sections, but ARC-III lists *authors* (e.g. Tuotuo for Songshi, Liao Shi, Jin Shi). The Yuan and Jin official histories (元史, 金史) are compiled works; 元史 is attributed to Song Lian et al. under Ming. So they are already implicitly covered by the medieval list (Tuotuo = 脱脱 for Song/Liao/Jin). For 元史 (Ming compilation), no named author is in ARC.

**Suggestion:** Add to ARC-T-MEDIEVAL (or a short "Compiled works" note) an explicit line:
• Yuan Shi (元史), Jin Shi (金史), Song Shi (宋史), Liao Shi (辽史) — Standard dynastic histories; may be cited by work name when MEM uses them as primary reference. Prefer Encyclopedia of China or scholarly translation when quoting; cite edition.

**Benefit:** Clarifies that MEMs can name and cite these histories without a separate "author" for each; supports accuracy when MEMs ground narrative in Chinese primary historiography.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
5. MEM AUTHORING GUIDANCE (CHINESE-LANGUAGE BALANCE)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

**Issue:** The session audit showed MEMs rely heavily on English secondary sources and do not quote or cite Chinese-language sources. ARC governs *who* may be quoted; it does not tell authors to *prefer* Chinese when available.

**Suggestion:** Add a short **MEM authoring note** (in ARC or in CIV–MEM–TEMPLATE): "When a MEM–CHINA thematises a topic for which an authoritative Chinese-language source exists (Encyclopedia of China, official document, or listed institutional source), prefer including at least one citation or verbatim quote from that Chinese-language source where it would materially improve accuracy or credibility."

**Benefit:** Encourages balance without mandating a fixed quota; aligns with the goal of improving credibility via Chinese-language grounding.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
6. OPTIONAL: 20TH-C. CHINESE HISTORIANS WRITING IN CHINESE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

**Issue:** ARC-T-MODERN is dominated by Western scholars and by Chinese scholars who wrote in English (e.g. Ray Huang, Chen Jian). There is no 20th- or 21st-century *Chinese* historian who wrote primarily in *Chinese* and is admissible for quotation (e.g. 钱穆 Qian Mu, 吕思勉 Lü Simian, 陈寅恪 Chen Yinke). Adding one or two would signal that Chinese-language historiography is part of the canon.

**Suggestion (optional):** Add to ARC-T-MODERN one or two figures, e.g.:
• 钱穆 Qian Mu (1895–1990) — 国史大纲 (Outline of National History); 国学概论. Chinese-language historiography; traditional narrative and cultural continuity. Applicable when MEM addresses dynastic narrative or cultural identity from a Chinese scholarly perspective.
**or**
• 吕思勉 Lü Simian (1884–1957) — 中国通史 (General History of China); multiple dynastic histories. Chinese-language synthesis; broad coverage.

**Benefit:** MEMs could quote Chinese scholarly historiography in translation or cite it; improves balance and credibility. **Cost:** Requires maintenance (which works, which editions, translation availability).

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
7. SHORT CHANGELOG / VERSION HISTORY IN ARC
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

**Issue:** Upgrades are noted in the header (Supersedes, Upgrade Type) but there is no in-file changelog. Future editors may want to see v3.0 → v3.1 → v3.2 at a glance.

**Suggestion:** Add a brief **IX-C. CHANGELOG** (or under IX. VERSIONING):
• v3.2 (2026-02-13): Encyclopedia of China (中国大百科全书) added to ARC-T-MODERN and ARC-T-INSTITUTIONAL (RESEARCH).
• v3.1 (2026-02-13): Chinese-language institutional sources; language note; State Council www.gov.cn; People's Daily; CIIS; Caixin Chinese.
• v3.0: Baseline; CORE consolidation.

**Benefit:** Traceability; easier audits.
