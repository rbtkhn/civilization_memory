# DIB Package: Doctrine 03 Refinement (Scope / Contemporary Application)

**Date:** 2026-02-13  
**Source:** SYNTHESIS 0013 (CIV–SCHOLAR–CHINA); STATE–CHINA doctrine audit addendum (30-day)  
**Purpose:** Proposed refinement to CIV–DOCTRINE–CHINA Doctrine 03 for DIB–CHINA acceptance.  
**Governance:** Doctrine change requires explicit user acceptance (DIB–CHINA). Apply to CIV–DOCTRINE–CHINA only after approval.

## I. RATIONALE

Doctrine 03 (Conquest-as-Connectivity Condition) encodes a **historical** pattern (Mongol/Yuan): conquest creates the condition for connectivity; connectivity does not routinely precede or exist independently of conquest in that pattern. A 30-day search (STATE–CHINA doctrine audit addendum) found that **current official strategy** (BRI) characterises connectivity as voluntary, non-coercive, and independent of coercion. That self-description tensions with the doctrine’s Operational Meaning phrase. Refinement **narrows scope** to the historical pattern and **adds** a contemporary-application note so that doctrine reflects actual behaviour (official rhetoric) without invalidating the historical claim.

---

## II. PROPOSED ADDITION TO CIV–DOCTRINE–CHINA

**Location:** Doctrine 03, after "Operational Meaning" bullets and before "Hard Constraints."

**New subsection to insert:**

```
Scope and Contemporary Application:
• The pattern above describes pre-modern, steppe-driven cases (Mongol
  Empire, Yuan) from which the doctrine was derived. Contemporary
  connectivity initiatives (e.g. Belt and Road) may be officially
  characterised as voluntary, non-coercive, and independent of
  conquest or coercion; that characterisation does not invalidate the
  historical pattern. Structural incentives (corridor security, route
  control) may persist regardless of official rhetoric; the doctrine
  remains applicable to historical analysis and to structural
  assessment of corridor logic where appropriate.
```

**Effect:** Doctrine 03 retains its full Definition, Operational Meaning, and Hard Constraints. The new subsection clarifies that (a) the "connectivity does not routinely exist independently of conquest" claim applies to the **historical** pattern, and (b) contemporary official presentation of connectivity as voluntary and independent of coercion is **in scope**—not a contradiction—so that doctrine and observed behaviour align.

## III. EXACT TEXT FOR CIV–DOCTRINE–CHINA (COPY-READY)

Insert the following after the third Operational Meaning bullet ("Route security and corridor control are structural incentives, not primarily ideological choices.") and before "Hard Constraints:":

Scope and Contemporary Application:

  Empire, Yuan) from which the doctrine was derived. Contemporary
  connectivity initiatives (e.g. Belt and Road) may be officially
  characterised as voluntary, non-coercive, and independent of
  conquest or coercion; that characterisation does not invalidate the

## IV. POST-ACCEPTANCE STEPS

If the user accepts this refinement (DIB–CHINA):

1. **CIV–DOCTRINE–CHINA:** Insert the "Scope and Contemporary Application" subsection into Doctrine 03 as in Section III. Increment version to v1.1 (content change per cmc-version-upgrade-on-edit).
2. **CIV–SCHOLAR–CHINA:** Update SYNTHESIS 0013 status from "CANDIDATE FOR DOCTRINE REFINEMENT — Pending DIB–CHINA acceptance" to "FROZEN → Doctrine 03 refinement (v1.1)." Update Doctrine Registry note for Doctrine v0.3 to "Refinement: SYNTHESIS 0013 accepted (DIB–CHINA); CIV–DOCTRINE–CHINA v1.1."
3. **CIV–CORE–CHINA:** Per mirroring (CIV–MEM–CORE § XVII), CORE may cite doctrine; if CORE currently quotes Doctrine 03, add a pointer to the new scope line or leave mirroring to next CORE revision.
4. **State Log (optional):** Record in CIV–STATE–CHINA that Doctrine 03 was refined (SYNTHESIS 0013, DIB–CHINA) to reflect scope and contemporary application.

---

## V. USER ACCEPTANCE

**To accept (DIB–CHINA):** User replies with explicit acceptance (e.g. "Accept DIB," "DIB accepted," "Approve Doctrine 03 refinement"). The system then applies Section IV steps.

**To reject or defer:** User may reject or request changes; SYNTHESIS 0013 remains CANDIDATE; no edit to CIV–DOCTRINE–CHINA.
