# RESEARCH — John Keegan *The Mask of Command*: Alexander in India (Command-as-Performance Framing)

**Date:** 2026-02-01  
**Scope:** John Keegan (1934–2012) — *The Mask of Command* (1987)  
**Purpose:** Command-as-performance framing for MEM–INDIA–WAR–ALEXANDER; no ARC–INDIA addition  
**Anchor:** SCHOLAR LEARN (Goldsworthy, Everitt, Keegan research); MEM–INDIA–WAR–ALEXANDER; CIV–SCHOLAR–ISLAM (Keegan corpus as civilization-contrast)

**Decision:** Keegan is **not** added to ARC–INDIA. He is documented here for **methodological / civilization-contrast** use: when MEM–INDIA–WAR–ALEXANDER (or related India war MEMs) document command, conquest, or the limit of Alexander’s campaign, Keegan’s framing can be cited for **command-as-performance** and **heroic leadership as cultural construction**—illuminating why the Indian terminus (mutiny at Hyphasis, withdrawal) can be read as the limit of that style of leadership, not only as “depth resistance” or “first failed universalist intrusion.”

## I. SOURCE

| Work | Year | Relevance to Alexander in India |
|------|------|----------------------------------|
| *The Mask of Command* | 1987 | Alexander as one of four exemplars of generalship; command as performance, “mask of command,” heroic leadership as cultural construction; generalship as “cultural enterprise.” India/Hydaspes not treated in detail; Alexander’s arc (including eastern limit) fits the thesis. |

## II. KEEGAN’S FRAMING (SUMMARY)

- **Alexander** is presented as “a supreme hero” and “archetypal hero” whose being and performance merged in his person.
- **Generalship** is “a cultural enterprise” shaped by the political imperatives and ethos of each era and society.
- **Command** is theatrical: the general as “accomplished actor” who reveals only what followers require, concealing the rest behind a “mask of command.”
- **Use for India:** Alexander’s Indian campaign—victory at Hydaspes, then mutiny at Hyphasis and withdrawal—can be read as the point where heroic, personal command met **institutional and geographic limit**: the army refused to go on. Keegan’s lens helps encode that moment as **limit of the mask** (soldier experience, exhaustion, refusal) rather than only as “Indian depth resistance” or “first failed universalist intrusion.”

## III. SUGGESTED USE IN MEM–INDIA–WAR–ALEXANDER

- **Where:** In or near sections on “depth resistance,” mutiny at Hyphasis, or “Alexander marks the first failed universalist intrusion.”
- **How:** One or two sentences framing Alexander’s command style (heroic, performative) and the Indian campaign as the theatre where that style met its practical limit (mutiny, withdrawal). Citation as **civilization-contrast or methodological** (e.g. “Keegan, *The Mask of Command* — command as performance; limit at Hyphasis”). Not verbatim ARC–INDIA; optional short paraphrase or attributed gloss.
- **ARC status:** Keegan remains **outside** ARC–INDIA. No verbatim minimum; no ERC/ARC-T designation for India. If cited, use explicit note: “Keegan (not in ARC–INDIA); command-as-performance framing.”

## IV. CROSS-REFERENCE

- **CIV–SCHOLAR–ISLAM:** Keegan corpus (e.g. *A History of Warfare*, *The Face of Battle*, *The Mask of Command*) already referenced for institutional restraint, command philosophy, soldier experience; citation for civilization-contrast when Islam MEMs document war/command. Same logic applies for India: Keegan as **contrast framing** for how Alexander’s style of command meets its limit in India.
- **MEM–INDIA–WAR–ALEXANDER:** Currently encodes Herodotus (ARC–PERSIA-T-ANCIENT) for pre-Alexander northwest India; Arrian and other ancients implied. Keegan adds a **modern**, **command-theoretic** layer without requiring ARC–INDIA listing.

## V. STATUS

Documented February 2026. No ARC–INDIA change. Use in MEM–INDIA–WAR–ALEXANDER is **optional**; if used, cite as methodological/civilization-contrast framing per above.
