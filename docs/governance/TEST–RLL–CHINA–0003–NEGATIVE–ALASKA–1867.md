# Test: RLL–CHINA–0003 — Negative/Limit Case (Alaska 1867)

**RLL under test:** RLL–CHINA–0003 (CANDIDATE) — cession–return–legitimacy pattern.  
**Case:** Alaska (1867)—transfer of Russian possessions in North America to the United States by treaty. Formally a "cession" (Treaty concerning the Cession of the Russian Possessions in North America); substantively a **purchase** ($7.2 million) negotiated between Russia and the U.S. Russia initiated the sale; no war, no defeat, no humiliation framing.  
**Purpose:** Test whether the RLL **over-applies**—i.e. applies when the cession–return–legitimacy grammar is **not** the dominant encoding. Document scope limit.

## I. SOURCES CONSULTED

### MEM corpus
- **MEM–AMERICA–DIPLOMACY–SEWARD:** Alaska purchase (1867) from Russia; $7.2 million; Russia willing to sell (territory distant, costly to defend; Crimean War had shown vulnerability); Seward saw Alaska as strategic (Pacific access, removal of European power from continent); "expansion as legitimacy"—U.S. right to extend perimeter; purchase and treaty as preferred instruments. No framing of Russian "loss" or legitimacy crisis; no "return" (no party recovering lost territory).

### Supplementary (scholarship / official)
- U.S. Department of State (history.state.gov): Russia offered to sell (1859); Crimean War "crippling loss" prompted reconsideration of North American holdings; Russia lacked resources for settlements/military; treaty signed 30 March 1867; Senate approved; transfer 18 October 1867.
- Standard historiography: Voluntary sale; no defeat or imposed terms; both parties sovereign; "cession" in treaty title denotes transfer of sovereignty, not humiliation.

## II. RLL–CHINA–0003 APPLIED — DOES THE PATTERN FIT?

### 1. Activation trigger (formal)

RLL applies to "territorial **cession**, handover, SEZ as reconstitution, or humiliation/recovery geography." Alaska 1867 is **formally** a cession (treaty of cession). So the RLL could be invoked. The question is whether the **pattern** (legitimacy turns on who lost, who regained, who overreached) actually holds.

### 2. Pattern: "Legitimacy turns on who lost, who regained, who overreached"

**Who lost?**  
- **Russia** transferred territory. But Russia **chose** to sell—it was not defeated; it did not experience the transfer as humiliation or legitimacy crisis. MEM (Seward): "Russia was willing to sell: the territory was distant, costly to defend, and the Crimean War had shown Russian vulnerability." The driver was fiscal/strategic, not loss of mandate or face.  
- **Conclusion:** There is a "transferor," but the transfer was not encoded as **loss** in the legitimacy sense. No defeat, no imposed treaty, no century-of-humiliation narrative for Russia.

**Who regained?**  
- **No one.** The United States **acquired** territory it had never held. There is no "return"—no party recovering territory previously lost. The RLL's "return" is central to the legitimacy grammar (reconstitution, recovery). Here there is only acquisition.  
- **Conclusion:** The "who regained" slot is empty. The pattern assumes a loser and a regainer (or an overreacher whose gain is reversed). Alaska has a seller and a buyer, not a loser and a regainer.

**Who overreached?**  
- Neither party framed the other as overreaching. Russia was shedding a burden; the U.S. was expanding. No annexation against resistance; no legitimacy gap that later reversed.  
- **Conclusion:** Overreach does not apply in the sense the RLL intends (gain that proves unstable or that creates grievance and eventual return).

### 3. "One geography, multiple encodings"

- **Russian encoding:** Voluntary divestment; strategic and fiscal rationalization; no humiliation.  
- **U.S. encoding:** Purchase; expansion; "Seward's Folly" (scepticism) then strategic and resource value.  
- There is no **competing legitimacy claim** over the same territory—no "we lost it, we must recover it" vs "we hold it." The encodings are seller/buyer, not loser/regainer.  
- **Conclusion:** The "one geography, multiple encodings" that the RLL expects (loss vs return, or overreach vs rollback) is absent. The geography changed hands without a legitimacy contest.

### 4. Three derivations

- **Mercouris:** Legitimacy encoding; recovery as reconstitution. **Fit:** Weak or none. Russian legitimacy did not depend on retaining Alaska; U.S. legitimacy did not depend on "recovering" it. No institutional continuity of loss-and-return.  
- **Mearsheimer:** Structural incentive to reclaim; gain can prove unstable. **Fit:** Weak. U.S. had incentive to acquire; Russia had incentive to sell. No structural incentive for Russia to "reclaim" Alaska—no legitimacy stake.  
- **Barnes:** Liability when return fails; irreversibility. **Fit:** Weak. No liability for "losing" territory (Russia sold); no irreversibility of a legitimacy wound (Russia did not frame it as wound).

### 5. Verdict: pattern does NOT fit

The RLL's core—**legitimacy turns on who lost, who regained, who overreached**—does **not** hold for Alaska 1867. The transfer was:
- **Voluntary** (seller-initiated),
- **Compensated** (purchase),
- **Without defeat or imposition** for the transferor,
- **Without "return"** (no party recovering previously lost territory).

So the RLL **should not be applied** to this case. Invoking it here would be over-application.

## III. SCOPE LIMIT (DOCUMENTED)

RLL–CHINA–0003 applies when:

1. **Legitimacy is at stake** for at least one party through the transfer—typically the transferor experiences the transfer as **loss** (defeat, humiliation, imposed cession) and/or a party experiences **return** (recovery, reconstitution) as legitimacy-affirming.
2. **"Cession" in the RLL sense** includes not only any formal treaty of cession, but **imposed or defeat-related cession** (e.g. Treaty of Nanjing, Frankfurt) or **reconstitution of authority** (e.g. Xianzong, Yuan/Ming). Voluntary **sale** of territory, where the seller does not frame the transfer as loss or legitimacy crisis, is **outside** the pattern.
3. **"Return"** implies a party **recovering** territory or authority previously lost. Mere **acquisition** of territory never held (e.g. U.S. acquiring Alaska) is not "return" and does not activate the return limb.

**Explicit scope limit for RLL–CHINA–0003:**  
When authoring or revising MEMs that treat **territorial transfer**, apply the cession–return–legitimacy pattern only when **legitimacy is materially at stake** through loss (defeat, humiliation, imposed terms) and/or return (recovery, reconstitution). Do **not** apply the pattern to voluntary, compensated transfers (e.g. purchase/sale) where neither party encodes the transfer as legitimacy crisis or recovery. Treat Alaska 1867 (and analogous cases) as **limit cases** that define the boundary of the RLL.

## IV. RECOMMENDATION

**Negative test result:** RLL–CHINA–0003 does **not** fit Alaska 1867. The test **succeeds** in that it identifies a clear **scope limit**: the RLL is not a general "territory changed hands" constraint but a **legitimacy-through-loss-and-return** constraint. Documenting this limit **strengthens** the RLL by reducing over-application risk. **Recommendation:** Add the scope limit (Section III) to the RLL's constraint statement or to a "Scope / limit cases" note in CIV–SCHOLAR–CHINA when promoting RLL–CHINA–0003 to CONFIRMED.
