# Test: RLL–INDIA–0002 — Negative/Limit Case (Decisive Field Victory Encoding)

**RLL under test:** RLL–INDIA–0002 (PROPOSED) — Two modes of limit via mechanism failure (invader's or defender's); who was exposed when the mechanism failed.  
**Case:** Limit case—when does the RLL **not** apply? Anglo-Sikh Wars (1845–1849): hard fighting (Ferozeshah, Sobraon); British tactical superiority and battlefield victory cited in historiography alongside fragmentation (post–Ranjit Singh).  
**Purpose:** Test whether RLL **over-applies** to cases where **decisive field victory** is the dominant encoding, not mechanism failure. Document scope limit.

## I. SOURCES CONSULTED

### MEM corpus
- No MEM–INDIA–WAR–ANGLO–SIKH in CIV–INDEX–INDIA. Anglo-Sikh Wars referenced in RESEARCH–INDIA–MILITARY–HISTORY–DEFECTION–THEORY as supporting **fragmentation** (defender elite defection/splits) but with note: "Anglo-Sikh Wars involved hard fighting (e.g. Ferozeshah 'close to defeat' for British). So fragmentation enabled entry and reduced cohesion, but **battlefield outcome was not purely political**."

### RESEARCH
- **RESEARCH–INDIA–MILITARY–HISTORY–DEFECTION–THEORY:** Anglo-Sikh Wars "Support theory: fragmentation and internal defection preceded British military success." Tension: "fragmentation is a **condition** that makes defender vulnerable; it does not require that every victory be bloodless."

### Supplementary
- Standard historiography: Anglo-Sikh Wars—battles at Ferozeshah (1845), Sobraon (1846), Chillianwala (1849), Gujarat (1849); British and East India Company forces won in the field; Sikh state dissolved. Fragmentation (post–Ranjit Singh succession, factional conflict) is part of the narrative but **decisive field victory** is also prominently encoded.

## II. RLL–INDIA–0002 APPLIED — DOES THE PATTERN OVER-APPLY?

### 1. Activation trigger (formal)

RLL applies when "assessing India WAR MEMs or when interpreting 'who was exposed when the mechanism failed.'" The question: in cases where **decisive military victory** (pitched battle, tactical superiority) is the **dominant** encoding, should the RLL be invoked?

### 2. Pattern: Mechanism failure vs decisive field victory

**Anglo-Sikh Wars**
- **Fragmentation:** Post–Ranjit Singh (1839), Sikh kingdom experienced factional conflict; British exploited divisions. RESEARCH supports "fragmentation and internal defection preceded British military success."
- **But:** Battles (Ferozeshah, Sobraon, etc.) involved heavy fighting; British came "close to defeat" at Ferozeshah. Historiography encodes **battlefield victory** as causally significant, not only political collapse.
- **Conclusion:** The case is **mixed**. Mechanism failure (fragmentation) is present, but decisive field victory is also a major part of the narrative. If the RLL were applied here, it would **compete** with the "decisive victory" encoding rather than clearly dominating it.

**Scope distinction**
- **Alexander, Clive:** Limit is encoded **primarily** as mechanism failure (army refusal; elite defection, political fragmentation). Decisive field victory is **not** the dominant encoding in the MEMs or in the RLL derivation.
- **Anglo-Sikh (and analogous cases):** Where **decisive field victory** is the **dominant** encoding—i.e. the outcome is explained primarily as "we beat them in battle"—the RLL's "who was exposed when the mechanism failed" may be **secondary** or inapplicable.
- **Conclusion:** RLL applies when limit/outcome is encoded via **mechanism failure** (who was exposed). When **decisive field victory** dominates the narrative, the RLL should not be **primary**; such cases define the boundary of the RLL.

### 3. Verdict: pattern has explicit scope

The RLL's core—**limit encodes via mechanism failure (invader's or defender's); same question, opposite answers**—does **not** require that every Indian war be interpreted through mechanism failure. When:
- The outcome is **primarily** explained as decisive military victory in the field (tactical superiority, battlefield defeat of the enemy), and
- Mechanism failure (defection, refusal, political collapse) is **not** the dominant encoding in the sources,

then the RLL **should not be applied as the primary lens**. Invoking it would be **over-application**. The RLL is **mechanism-failure-dominant** in scope.

## III. SCOPE LIMIT (DOCUMENTED)

RLL–INDIA–0002 applies when:

1. **Encoding:** The **limit or outcome** of the conflict is encoded **primarily** as **mechanism failure**—i.e. who was exposed when the invader's instrument failed (e.g. army refusal) or when the defender's cohesion failed (e.g. elite defection, political fragmentation). The same question ("who was exposed when the mechanism failed") must be answerable with opposite locus (invader vs defender) for the two-mode structure.
2. **Decisive field victory:** When the outcome is **primarily** encoded as **decisive military victory** (pitched battle, tactical superiority, enemy army defeated in the field) and mechanism failure is secondary or absent, the RLL is **not** the primary interpretive lens. Such cases (e.g. Anglo-Sikh Wars where hard fighting is central) are **limit cases**.
3. **Civilizational endurance:** The RLL also requires that civilizational endurance be preserved (intact or delayed). Cases where the outcome is "civilization erased" or "polity destroyed without continuity" may fall outside the RLL's scope.

**Explicit scope limit for RLL–INDIA–0002:**  
When authoring or revising MEMs or assessing India WAR narratives, apply the mechanism-failure (two-mode, who was exposed) pattern when the **dominant** encoding is mechanism failure, not decisive field victory. Do **not** apply the RLL as the primary lens when decisive battlefield victory dominates the narrative. Treat Anglo-Sikh Wars and analogous "hard fighting + victory" cases as **limit cases** that define the boundary of the RLL.

## IV. RECOMMENDATION

**Negative test result:** RLL–INDIA–0002 does **not** over-apply to decisive-field-victory-dominant cases. The test **succeeds** in that it identifies a clear **scope limit**: the RLL is mechanism-failure-dominant. Documenting this limit **strengthens** the RLL. **Recommendation:** Add the scope limit (Section III) to RLL–INDIA–0002 or to a "Scope / limit cases" note in CIV–SCHOLAR–INDIA when promoting to CONFIRMED.
