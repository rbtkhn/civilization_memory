**Mode:** LEARN  
**Civilization:** CHINA (中华文明)  
**Subject:** Consumption of Niall Ferguson sources relevant to China civilizational memory  
**Date:** February 2026

I. SCOPE OF INGESTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

**Ferguson works consumed (external/web + ARC–CHINA listing):**

| Work | Year | ARC–CHINA status | Relevance to China MEMs |
|------|------|------------------|--------------------------|
| *Civilization: The West and the Rest* | 2011 | Listed (ARC–CHINA) | Civilizational comparison; Ming China as counterpoint; "six killer apps"; West vs China overtake; "two civilizations switched places 1368–1842" |
| *China: Triumph and Turmoil* | 2012 | Listed (ARC–CHINA) | TV series; Emperors, Maostalgia, Superpower; unity vs contradictions; communist system + capitalist economy; Mao legacy; China's global rise |
| *Kissinger, 1923–1968: The Idealist* | 2015 | Listed (ARC–CHINA) | Kissinger biography; strategic context; China opening (tangential to late Qing / Opium Wars) |
| *Empire: How Britain Made the Modern World* | 2003 | **Not** in ARC–CHINA | British Empire as "midwife to modernity"; Opium Wars context (trade imbalance, Treaty of Nanjing); Britain–China interaction. **In ARC–ANGLIA, ARC–INDIA.** |

**Note:** *Empire* is integrated in Anglia and India MEMs (verbatim SOURCE EVIDENCE). For China MEMs to cite *Empire* on British–China / Opium Wars, cross-ARC citation (ARC–ANGLIA per CIV–ARC–TEMPLATE § V-A) or ARC–DISCOVERY would be required unless ARC–CHINA is updated to include *Empire*.

II. SYNTHESIS — WHAT FERGUSON ADDS FOR CHINA
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

**Civilization (West and the Rest):**  
It seems to me that Ferguson supplies a **comparative civilizational frame** that existing China MEMs do not yet encode explicitly: Ming China as the polity that might have led the world six hundred years ago, and the claim that "two civilizations switched places" between 1368 and 1842. That interval brackets Ming and Qing; the endpoint (1842) is the Treaty of Nanjing after the First Opium War. The "six killer applications" (competition, science, rule of law, consumerism, medicine, work ethic) are offered as why the West overtook China; the Rest—including China—having since "downloaded" those apps underpins his reading of China's resurgence. This fits **MEM–CHINA–DYNASTY–QING** (external pressures, failure to modernize, 内忧外患) and **MEM–CHINA–WAR–BOXER–REBELLION** (climactic collision with the West, century of humiliation) as a **secondary interpretive layer**: not primary evidence for events, but a named comparative thesis (West vs Rest, killer apps) that can be cited where MEMs discuss Qing decline, encroachment, or legitimacy stress.

**China: Triumph and Turmoil:**  
The 2012 series addresses **unity despite contradictions**—communist polity plus capitalist economy—and the persistence of Mao in official memory alongside China's rise. That is contemporary and PRC-focused; it connects to continuity insights (Qing fall, republican and Maoist rupture, reform-era re-stabilization) but is not yet encoded in a dedicated PRC or Mao MEM in the China index. The series is useful for **strategic and economic history** and **China in global power dynamics** (per ARC–CHINA line 89); it does not replace Lovell (*The Opium War*) or Kissinger (*On China*) for late Qing or Boxer.

**Empire (British Empire):**  
*Empire* treats British expansion as "midwife to modernity" and includes British–China interaction (Opium Wars, treaty ports, trade). The work is **not** currently in ARC–CHINA; it is in ARC–ANGLIA and ARC–INDIA and is used verbatim in India and Anglia MEMs. For China, *Empire* would support: (1) **MEM–CHINA–DYNASTY–QING** — Opium Wars, unequal treaties, Western encroachment; (2) a **future MEM–CHINA–WAR–OPIUM** (or equivalent) if created; (3) **MEM–CHINA–WAR–BOXER–REBELLION** — as successor phase of Western imposition. Use in China MEMs would require **cross-ARC citation** (e.g. Ferguson *Empire* [ARC–ANGLIA–T–MODERN]) per CIV–ARC–TEMPLATE § V-A, or an ARC–CHINA upgrade adding *Empire* to Ferguson's topical scope.

III. CONNECTIONS TO EXISTING CHINA MEMs
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

| MEM | Current SOURCE / ARC | Ferguson connection (post-ingestion) |
|-----|----------------------|--------------------------------------|
| MEM–CHINA–DYNASTY–QING | Kissinger (*On China*) | *Civilization*: Ming/Qing as Rest overtaken by West; killer apps; 1368–1842. *Empire* (if cross-ARC): Opium Wars, Treaty of Nanjing, British encroachment. |
| MEM–CHINA–WAR–BOXER–REBELLION | Kissinger; Lovell (*Opium War*) in bibliography | *Civilization*: West vs Rest, imposition. *Empire* (if cross-ARC): late imperial coercion, treaty-port logic. *China: Triumph and Turmoil*: Mao legacy, unity vs contradictions (thematic, not event-specific). |
| MEM–CHINA–WAR–OPIUM | **Does not exist** | Would be natural host for Ferguson *Empire* (and Lovell *Opium War*) on First/Second Opium War, Nanjing, Tientsin, British–Qing structural clash. |

IV. LEARN OUTPUT — NO WRITE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

This ingestion **does not** create or edit MEMs. It summarizes Ferguson's China-relevant content and maps it to existing MEMs and ARC rules. Proposed next steps (if any) belong in WRITE mode or governance (e.g. ARC–CHINA scope change, cross-ARC citation guideline, or MEM–CHINA–WAR–OPIUM proposal).

**Verbatim:** No Ferguson verbatim was added to China MEMs in this LEARN step. India/Anglia Ferguson *Empire* verbatim pattern (SOURCE EVIDENCE block, translation/edition, one-line framing) could be replicated for China if ARC permits and WRITE mode is used.
