# AUDIT — SCHOLAR–CHINA vs DOCTRINE–CHINA (Alignment, Contradictions, Tensions)

**Date:** 2026-02-13  
**Scope:** CIV–SCHOLAR–CHINA (content/civilizations/CHINA/CIV–SCHOLAR–CHINA.md); CIV–DOCTRINE–CHINA (absent)  
**Authority:** CIV–MEM–CORE § XVII (Doctrine Mirroring), § XVIII (Doctrine Formation Law)  
**Purpose:** Audit alignment between Scholar and Doctrine for China; surface contradictions or tensions.

---

## I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

| Finding | Result |
|---------|--------|
| CIV–DOCTRINE–CHINA exists? | **NO** — file not present |
| Sole doctrine locus | CIV–SCHOLAR–CHINA § XVIII (Doctrine Registry) |
| Internal contradictions (within SCHOLAR doctrines) | **NONE** |
| Tensions (preserved, non-resolving) | **TWO** — documented below; both are sequencing/complementarity, not logical conflict |
| Readiness for future CIV–DOCTRINE–CHINA | SCHOLAR is **source-ready**; three frozen doctrines available to mirror |

**Verdict:** No contradictions between SCHOLAR–CHINA and DOCTRINE–CHINA because DOCTRINE–CHINA does not exist. SCHOLAR–CHINA’s three frozen doctrines are internally consistent. Two intentional tensions (peak/exhaustion vs reconstitution; conquest-as-connectivity vs non-Han peak-then-exhaustion) are sequencing/complementarity across time and domain; no governance violation. When CIV–DOCTRINE–CHINA is created, it must derive from this registry and mirror per CIV–MEM–CORE § XVII.

---

## II. ABSENCE OF CIV–DOCTRINE–CHINA

**Governance (CIV–MEM–CORE § XVII):**
- Each civilization **MAY** define a CIV–DOCTRINE–[CIV] file.
- CIV–DOCTRINE–[CIV] contains only ACCEPTED, FROZEN doctrines; is a registry; may not originate doctrines (must derive from SCHOLAR synthesis).
- When it exists, CIV–DOCTRINE–[CIV] **MUST** be mirrored verbatim into CIV–CORE–[CIV] and CIV–SCHOLAR–[CIV].

**Current state:** CIV–DOCTRINE–CHINA is **not present** in the repository. CIV–INDEX–CHINA states: "CIV–DOCTRINE–CHINA: Not present."

**Implication:** There is no second document to compare. All frozen doctrine for China lives in CIV–SCHOLAR–CHINA § XVIII (Doctrine Registry). Alignment audit therefore evaluates (1) internal consistency of SCHOLAR’s doctrine set, and (2) any tensions between those doctrines and other SCHOLAR content (syntheses, SDI, heuristics, candidate beliefs).

---

## III. SCHOLAR–CHINA DOCTRINE REGISTRY (SOURCE OF TRUTH)

Three doctrines are frozen in CIV–SCHOLAR–CHINA:

| ID | Label | Source synthesis | One-line content |
|----|--------|------------------|------------------|
| v0.1 | NON-HAN CONSOLIDATION: PEAK THEN EXHAUSTION | SYNTHESIS 0004 | Non-Han dynasties (e.g. Qing) can achieve peak imperial reach via Sinicized admin and multi-ethnic framework; peak and then exhaustion when external pressure and internal rigidity converge irreversibly. |
| v0.2 | RUPTURE-TO-RECONSTITUTION | SYNTHESIS 0007 | Fragmentation (ROC) reversed by revolutionary monopolization of coercive, administrative, and symbolic authority through PRC party–state fusion and vertical penetration. |
| v0.3 | CONQUEST-AS-CONNECTIVITY CONDITION | SYNTHESIS 0010 | Steppe conquest (Mongol) creates the structural condition for connectivity; secure corridors and adaptive multi-ethnic governance outlast conquest and produce lasting institutional legacies. |

All three carry Assumptions Boxes and TIER 2 Confidence per Template § XIV. Traceability: SYNTHESIS 0004 ← ENTRIES 0004–0005 (Yuan, Qing); SYNTHESIS 0007 ← 0007–0008 (ROC, PRC); SYNTHESIS 0010 ← 0011–0012 (Pax Mongolica, Mongol Empire).

---

## IV. INTERNAL CONSISTENCY (DOCTRINES v0.1, v0.2, v0.3)

**v0.1 vs v0.2 (peak/exhaustion vs rupture/reconstitution):**
- v0.1 describes **Qing** trajectory: non-Han peak, then exhaustion (external pressure + internal rigidity).
- v0.2 describes **ROC → PRC** trajectory: fragmentation then revolutionary reconstitution.
- **Relationship:** Sequential in time (Qing exhaustion → ROC rupture → PRC reconstitution). SCHOLAR’s SYNTHESIS 0005–0007 chain makes this sequence explicit. No contradiction; v0.1 and v0.2 apply to different phases.

**v0.1 vs v0.3 (non-Han peak/exhaustion vs conquest-as-connectivity):**
- v0.1: non-Han consolidation can reach peak then exhaust (Yuan → Qing pattern).
- v0.3: conquest (Mongol) creates condition for connectivity; corridors and adaptive governance outlast conquest.
- **Relationship:** v0.3 focuses on **Mongol** conquest and Pax Mongolica; v0.1 focuses on **Qing** peak and exhaustion. Yuan is the first non-Han precedent in v0.1; v0.3 explains how that conquest phase produced connectivity. Complementary, not conflicting.

**v0.2 vs v0.3:** Different domains (PRC reconstitution vs Mongol connectivity). No overlap that would generate contradiction.

**Conclusion:** No logical contradictions among the three doctrines.

---

## V. TENSIONS (PRESERVED, NON-RESOLVING)

**Tension 1 — Peak vs reconstitution (same civilization, different phases):**  
"Peak then exhaustion" (v0.1) and "rupture then reconstitution" (v0.2) describe different stages of the same civilizational sequence. The tension is **temporal**: one phase ends in exhaustion; a later phase restarts via reconstitution. SCHOLAR does not resolve whether reconstitution "reverses" exhaustion in a normative sense; it records both patterns. **Governance:** Preserving this tension is permitted (non-synthesis rule; constraint-oriented synthesis only).

**Tension 2 — Conquest as condition vs conquest as precedent for peak-then-exhaustion:**  
v0.3 says conquest can create connectivity and institutional legacies; v0.1 says the next non-Han dynasty (Qing) can peak then exhaust. So conquest (Yuan) both enables connectivity (v0.3) and establishes a precedent for a later peak-and-exhaustion (Qing, v0.1). The tension is **complementarity**: same historical material (Yuan/Mongol, Qing) encoded in two patterns. No resolution required; both are retained.

## VI. SCHOLAR INTERNAL ALIGNMENT (DOCTRINES vs REST OF SCHOLAR)

| SCHOLAR element | Relationship to doctrines | Contradiction? |
|-----------------|----------------------------|-----------------|
| HEURISTIC CHINA–HW–01 | Explicitly derived from DOCTRINE v0.1 (SYNTHESIS 0004). Restates "peak then exhaustion." | No |
| CANDIDATE BELIEF 0001 | Derived from SYNTHESIS 0007 (doctrine v0.2). Consolidation before normalization. | No |
| CANDIDATE BELIEF 0002 | Derived from SYNTHESIS 0010 (doctrine v0.3). Conquest/connectivity/legacies. | No |
| SDI 0001, 0002, 0004 | Reference legitimacy shift, defeat, rupture, reconstitution, non-Han peak/exhaustion. Align with v0.1, v0.2. | No |
| SDI 0003 | China: Mongol conquest, Yuan/Qing consolidation, conquest-as-connectivity. Aligns with v0.1, v0.3. | No |
| Unfrozen syntheses (0001–0003, 0005–0009) | Build toward or sit alongside the frozen three; no statement contradicts v0.1–v0.3. | No |

No internal contradictions between the Doctrine Registry and other SCHOLAR content.

## VII. CIV–CORE–CHINA AND DOCTRINE

CIV–CORE–CHINA does **not** reference CIV–DOCTRINE–CHINA or list mirrored doctrines. It uses "doctrine" only for its own structural sections (e.g. Centralized Absorption Doctrine, Economic–Industrial Doctrine).  

**Governance (CIV–MEM–CORE § XVII):** When CIV–DOCTRINE–[CIV] exists, it **MUST** be mirrored verbatim into CIV–CORE–[CIV] and CIV–SCHOLAR–[CIV]. So when CIV–DOCTRINE–CHINA is created, CIV–CORE–CHINA will need a mechanism (e.g. a "Mirrored doctrines" or "Doctrine registry" subsection) to hold the mirror. Today there is nothing to mirror; no alignment failure.

---

## VIII. RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **No change required for alignment.** With DOCTRINE–CHINA absent, SCHOLAR–CHINA is the single source of frozen doctrine; it is consistent and tension-documented.
2. **If creating CIV–DOCTRINE–CHINA:**  
   - Populate it only with doctrines derived from SCHOLAR–CHINA § XVIII (v0.1, v0.2, v0.3).  
   - Do not add doctrines that do not derive from a frozen synthesis in SCHOLAR.  
   - After creation, mirror CIV–DOCTRINE–CHINA verbatim into CIV–CORE–CHINA and CIV–SCHOLAR–CHINA per § XVII; add a mirroring/mirrored-doctrine section to CORE if the template does not already provide one.
3. **Optional:** In CIV–INDEX–CHINA or CIV–SCHOLAR–CHINA § II, keep the note that CIV–DOCTRINE–CHINA is not present and that the Doctrine Registry in SCHOLAR is the current authority for China doctrines.

---

## IX. VERDICT

**Alignment:** N/A for a second file (CIV–DOCTRINE–CHINA absent).  
**Contradictions:** None among SCHOLAR–CHINA’s three doctrines or between them and the rest of SCHOLAR.  
**Tensions:** Two; both are sequencing/complementarity and are preserved intentionally; no governance violation.  
**Readiness:** SCHOLAR–CHINA is source-ready for any future CIV–DOCTRINE–CHINA; creation and mirroring must follow CIV–MEM–CORE § XVII–XVIII.
