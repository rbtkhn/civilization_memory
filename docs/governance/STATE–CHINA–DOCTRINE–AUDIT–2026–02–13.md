# STATE–CHINA Doctrine Audit: CIV–DOCTRINE–CHINA vs Current Chinese Foreign Policy

**Date:** 2026-02-13  
**Mode:** STATE (entity: China)  
**Sources:** CIV–DOCTRINE–CHINA v1.0; CIV–CORE–CHINA v3.0; CIV–STATE–CHINA v1.0  
**Evidence window:** Past 7 days (approx. 6–13 February 2026)  
**ARC coverage:** Chinese official (FMPRC) + Western/Taiwan reporting (Reuters, NBC, Focus Taiwan, Taipei Times). Per ARC Source Coverage Rule: at least two categories; entity official included. Contradictions surfaced below.

## I. EVIDENCE SUMMARY (ATTRIBUTED)

**Chinese official (ARC–CHINA–T-INSTITUTIONAL/OFFICIAL):**
- FMPRC Spokesperson Lin Jian (6 Feb, 9 Feb): Taiwan as core interest; call for Lithuania to “redress mistakes” on Taiwan office; Japan urged to retract “erroneous remarks” on Taiwan and avoid militarism. (Source: FMPRC, ARC–CHINA–T-INSTITUTIONAL/OFFICIAL; Editorial note: PRC state; primary authority on policy intent.)
- Xi Jinping–Trump phone call (5 Feb): Xi urged “prudence” on US arms sales to Taiwan; Taiwan described as “the most important issue in China–US relations.” (Source: China.org.cn, Xinhua-derived; ARC–CHINA–T-INSTITUTIONAL/OFFICIAL.)
- Xi Jinping–Putin virtual meeting (4 Feb): Readiness to “chart a new blueprint” for bilateral ties; call to uphold UN-centered system and global strategic stability. (Source: China.org.cn; ARC–CHINA–T-INSTITUTIONAL/OFFICIAL.)
- Wang Yi, MFA New Year Reception (Feb 2026): Broad foreign-policy framing; “open door” to communication with Lithuania conditional on correcting Taiwan-related “mistakes.”

**Western / Taiwan reporting (cross-entity; not in ARC–CHINA):**
- US–Taiwan trade deal finalised (12–13 Feb): Reciprocal deal; Taiwan to buy ~$85 bn US goods over four years; US tariff on Taiwanese imports at 15%; Lai: Taiwan–US relations “rock solid.” (Source: Reuters, NBC, CNBC, Taipei Times; Editorial note: Western/Taiwan outlets; pro-Taiwan framing in places.)
- Lai Ching-te: Taiwan–US ties “rock solid”; White House: Washington’s Taiwan and cross-strait policies “unaltered.” (Source: Taipei Times, NBC; Taiwan/US official framing.)
- Europe–China: “Issues-based cooperation,” leaders visiting Beijing; China framed as “source of stability”; Trump visit to China planned April. (Source: Foreign Policy, CCTV English; mixed editorial.)

**Contradiction (surfaced, not resolved):** Chinese official framing presents Taiwan as the “most important” China–US issue and demands “prudence” on arms sales and correction of “mistakes” (Lithuania, Japan). US and Taiwan official framing presents Taiwan–US relations as “rock solid” and policies “unaltered,” with a major trade deal concluded. The decision-maker weighs which narrative and which commitments hold; the system preserves both.

## II. AUDIT BY DOCTRINE

### Doctrine 01 — Non-Han Consolidation: Peak Then Exhaustion

**Definition (summary):** Peak imperial reach does not guarantee durability; external pressure and internal rigidity can converge irreversibly and produce systemic exhaustion.

**Relevance to current foreign policy:** 01 is a historical (Yuan–Qing) pattern. It does not prescribe current policy; it implies that if the polity is at or near “peak reach,” durability is not guaranteed and the combination of external pressure and internal rigidity is the exhaustion signal.

**Current behaviour (7-day evidence):** Diplomatic surge (multiple leaders to Beijing, Xi–Putin, Xi–Trump); reinforcement of Russia partnership; Europe framed as moving “beyond blocs”; Taiwan asserted as “most important” China–US issue; MFA warnings to Japan and Lithuania on Taiwan. No sign of retrenchment or public hedging on 01 grounds.

**Assessment:** **Neutral / Observational.** No violation. 01 is descriptive. Current policy extends diplomatic and strategic reach (Russia, Europe, Taiwan narrative). Doctrine would flag that external pressure (US, Taiwan, tech containment) and internal rigidity (party–state, narrative control) could converge; 7-day news does not show exhaustion signals, nor does it show leadership explicitly tempering expansion with 01-style risk. Option B (exit-building, axis diversification) in STATE–CHINA is consistent with hedging against 01-type exhaustion; recent Russia and Europe outreach is consistent with axis optionality.

---

### Doctrine 02 — Rupture-to-Reconstitution

**Definition (summary):** Fragmentation is reversed by revolutionary monopolization (party–state fusion, vertical penetration); not constitutional or procedural continuity. Consolidation precedes normalisation.

**Relevance to current foreign policy:** 02 governs the *mechanism* of authority (party–state, vertical penetration) and excludes legitimacy through liberal constitutionalism or procedural continuity. It does not forbid de-escalation or negotiation; it forbids regime-form change.

**Current behaviour (7-day evidence):** All reported foreign policy is conducted through party–state institutions: Xi–Putin and Xi–Trump at leader level; MFA (Lin Jian, Wang Yi) for statements; Taiwan, Japan, Lithuania framed through one-China and “mistakes”/“erroneous remarks.” No move toward constitutional or procedural legitimacy in foreign policy; no delegation to non-party institutions for core strategic narrative.

**Assessment:** **Aligned.** Current Chinese foreign policy is consistent with Doctrine 02. Authority is monopolized; messaging is centralized; no procedural or constitutional alternative is on offer. Taiwan is framed as sovereignty and legitimacy issue, not as a question of liberal procedure. Option D (Negotiated Accommodation) in STATE–CHINA is de-escalation and face-saving within party–state frame—allowed by 02; regime-form change would not be.

---

### Doctrine 03 — Conquest-as-Connectivity Condition

**Definition (summary):** Conquest (or system-breaking) creates the structural condition for connectivity; secure corridors and adaptive governance can outlast conquest. Corridor security and route control are structural incentives.

**Relevance to current foreign policy:** 03 is a historical (Mongol/Pax Mongolica) pattern. Applied analogically: corridor security, route control, and connectivity (BRI, maritime, partnerships) as rational responses to scale and dependency. No literal “conquest” in 7-day news.

**Current behaviour (7-day evidence):** Russia partnership (“new blueprint,” strategic stability) supports corridor and sanctions-exit logic. Europe “beyond blocs” and issue-based cooperation fit connectivity and diversification. Taiwan Strait and maritime sovereignty remain central (MFA on Japan, Taiwan); no new corridor announcements in the 7-day window.

**Assessment:** **Consistent.** 03’s structural logic (corridor security, route control, connectivity as structural incentive) is consistent with continued emphasis on strategic partnerships, BRI, and maritime sovereignty. No contradiction. Option B (exit-building) and Option C (maritime/spatial consolidation) in STATE–CHINA are consistent with 03-type logic.

## III. SYNTHESIS

| Doctrine | Verdict | Note |
|----------|---------|------|
| 01 (Peak Then Exhaustion) | Neutral | No violation. Current reach-extension consistent with “peak” phase; doctrine flags exhaustion risk (pressure + rigidity); no evidence of exhaustion or explicit 01-based caution. |
| 02 (Rupture-to-Reconstitution) | Aligned | Foreign policy conducted through party–state monopoly; no constitutional/procedural legitimacy in play. |
| 03 (Conquest-as-Connectivity) | Consistent | Corridor/connectivity and partnership logic consistent with 03; no contradiction. |

**CORE diagnostics:** No doctrine audit override of CIV–CORE–CHINA mandatory outputs. MSI, Narrative Control, Escalation Stability, Axis Optionality, and other STATE–CHINA indicators remain the binding variables for material options; this audit does not change option logic.

**Recommendation:** Record this audit in CIV–STATE–CHINA Section X (State Log) and, if desired, in Section VII (Decision-Relevant History) under “Doctrine audit & session outputs” with a one-line summary and this file path.

## IV. SOURCE ATTRIBUTION (ARC COMPLIANCE)

- Chinese official: FMPRC (fmprc.gov.cn), China.org.cn (Xinhua-derived) — ARC–CHINA–T-INSTITUTIONAL/OFFICIAL.
- Western/Taiwan: Reuters, NBC, CNBC, Taipei Times, Focus Taiwan, Foreign Policy, CCTV English — used for US/Taiwan/Europe framing; not in ARC–CHINA; cross-entity or general news.
- Contradiction surfaced: Chinese “most important issue” / “prudence” / “mistakes” vs US–Taiwan “rock solid” / “unaltered” / trade deal. Decision-maker resolves; system preserves both.
