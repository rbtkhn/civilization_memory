# PROPOSAL — Three New China MEMs from Scholar Learnings

**Purpose:** Suggest 3 new MEM–CHINA files to create based on CIV–SCHOLAR–CHINA catch-up (Phases 1–4), doctrines, syntheses, and SDI.  
**Governed by:** CIV–MEM–CORE, CIV–INDEX–CHINA, CIV–SCHOLAR–CHINA § XXV (MEM Authoring Guidance)  
**Status:** Proposal (creation in WRITE mode with explicit authorization)  
**Last Update:** February 2026

RATIONALE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Scholar-China now encodes: DOCTRINE v0.1 (non-Han peak then exhaustion), v0.2 (rupture-to-reconstitution), v0.3 (conquest-as-connectivity); SYNTHESIS 0005 (defeat fixes "century of humiliation"), 0006 (defeat/indemnity precede rupture), 0007 (fragmentation reversed by monopolization); SDI China ↔ Anglia (defeat/authority, legitimacy encoding). The current MEM set has no dedicated MEM for (1) the Opium Wars (structural opener of "century of humiliation"), (2) the 1911 Revolution (rupture event: Qing fall, ROC founding), or (3) the Grand Canal as a GEO corridor (conquest-as-connectivity, War Song–Yuan, Kublai). Creating these three MEMs would close gaps in the Scholar–MEM graph and give LEARN/OGE strong connection-derived options.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. MEM–CHINA–WAR–OPIUM
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
**Subject:** Opium Wars — First Opium War (1839–1842), Second Opium War (1856–1860); Treaty of Nanjing; Treaty of Tianjin; Summer Palace (1860).  
**Class:** MEM (Civilizational Memory) — WAR  
**Proposed placement:** CIV–INDEX–CHINA § VII (Wars & Conflicts)

**Rationale from Scholar learnings:**
• **SYNTHESIS 0005, SDI 0001/0002:** Defeat and indemnity fix "century of humiliation" in strategic memory; Opium Wars are the **structural opener** of that narrative (treaty ports, indemnity, unequal treaties) before Boxer. Boxer MEM already references "century of humiliation" and Qing collapse; adding Opium Wars gives the full arc: Opium → Boxer → ROC → PRC.
• **DOCTRINE v0.1, HEURISTIC CHINA–HW–01:** Qing peak then exhaustion; external pressure (Opium Wars, then Boxer) and internal rigidity converge. Opium Wars MEM would make "external pressure" explicit at the start of late Qing decline.
• **MEM CONNECTIONS (proposed):** MEM–CHINA–DYNASTY–QING (Qing as polity; late Qing under pressure), MEM–CHINA–WAR–BOXER–REBELLION (Boxer as climactic humiliation; Opium as precedent), MEM–CHINA–ROC (Republican inheritance of humiliation narrative), MEM–CHINA–PRC (PRC encoding of century of humiliation), MEM–CHINA–DYNASTY–MING (contrast: tribute system precedent).

**Structure suggestion:** Single MEM with internal phases (Phase 1: 1839–1842, Nanjing; Phase 2: 1856–1860, Tianjin, Summer Palace 1860) per existing multi-phase war MEMs (e.g. MEM–CHINA–WAR–SONG–YUAN). GEO/corridor angle: treaty ports as nodes; maritime imposition. ARC: Ferguson *Empire* (cross-ARC if not in ARC–CHINA), Kissinger *On China*; verbatim per § XXV.

**Index:** Register in CIV–INDEX–CHINA § VII after MEM–CHINA–WAR–BOXER–REBELLION (chronological: Opium before Boxer).

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
2. MEM–CHINA–REVOLUTION–1911
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
**Subject:** Xinhai Revolution / 1911 Revolution — fall of Qing (1912), founding of Republic of China; rupture event; Sun Yat-sen, Yuan Shikai; legitimacy transfer failure.  
**Class:** MEM (Civilizational Memory) — INST or WAR/rupture (register in § VII or new category per Index convention)  
**Proposed placement:** CIV–INDEX–CHINA § VII (Wars & Conflicts) or § IV (Dynasties & Regimes) adjacent to ROC

**Rationale from Scholar learnings:**
• **SYNTHESIS 0006, DOCTRINE v0.2:** "Defeat and indemnity (Boxer Protocol) preceded revolutionary rupture; the ROC ended dynastic rule without resolving the problem of national authority." The **1911 Revolution** is the named rupture event: Qing fall, ROC founding. Creating a dedicated MEM makes the rupture explicit and gives ROC a direct "Breaks if removed" dependency.
• **SDI 0001, 0002:** China vs Anglia defeat/authority: China's rupture (1911) did not resolve national authority; Anglia's defeats were absorbed procedurally. A 1911 MEM sharpens the contrast (rupture without procedural absorption).
• **MEM CONNECTIONS (proposed):** MEM–CHINA–DYNASTY–QING (Qing as polity that fell), MEM–CHINA–ROC (ROC as successor; 1911 as founding), MEM–CHINA–WAR–BOXER–REBELLION (Boxer accelerated legitimacy loss; Protocol preceded rupture), MEM–CHINA–PRC (PRC as later reconstitution of authority).

**Structure suggestion:** Rupture/revolution MEM: PURPOSE & SCOPE (rupture event, legitimacy transfer failure); key actors and chronology; structural outcome (dynasty ended, authority unresolved); MEM CONNECTIONS; SOURCE EVIDENCE (ARC–CHINA where applicable). Non-closure: 1911 as necessary but insufficient for national consolidation.

**Index:** Register in CIV–INDEX–CHINA § VII (if as conflict/rupture) or § IV (if as regime-founding event). Recommend § VII for consistency with other "war/conflict" MEMs.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
3. MEM–CHINA–GEO–GRAND–CANAL
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
**Subject:** Grand Canal (大运河) — corridor linking Yellow River and Yangtze; bulk logistics; Yuan extension under Kublai; structural condition for Song–Yuan conquest and post-conquest connectivity.  
**Class:** GEO–MEM (Civilizational Memory) — Geography & Spatial Control  
**Proposed placement:** CIV–INDEX–CHINA § VIII (Geography & Spatial Control)

**Rationale from Scholar learnings:**
• **DOCTRINE v0.3 (Conquest-as-Connectivity), SYNTHESIS 0002, 0010:** "Conquest (Mongol Empire) created the structural condition for connectivity; secure corridors and adaptive governance outlasted conquest." "Conquest of a commercial-maritime polity (Song) required naval and riverine capacity... Grand Canal, junks, Yangtze." The Grand Canal is the **named corridor** in War Song–Yuan and Pax Mongolica; a dedicated GEO–MEM makes chokepoint/corridor logic explicit and supports Mearsheimer strategic cognition (~2/3) per GEO–MEM blend.
• **ENTRY 0003, SYNTHESIS 0002:** Land for speed, water for bulk; Yuan extended Grand Canal for military supply and grain; naval/riverine pivot was condition for Yuan victory. Grand Canal MEM would be the GEO node that War Song–Yuan, Kublai, Pax Mongolica, and Silk Road all reference.
• **MEM CONNECTIONS (proposed):** MEM–CHINA–WAR–SONG–YUAN (Canal extension for siege/logistics), MEM–CHINA–MONGOL–KUBLAI–KHAN (Kublai's canal policy), MEM–CHINA–DYNASTY–YUAN (Yuan administration of Canal), MEM–CHINA–MONGOL–EMPIRE–PAX–MONGOLICA (bulk goods by water; Yam + Canal), MEM–CHINA–SILK–ROAD (river/canal links for bulk), MEM–CHINA–DYNASTY–SONG (Song commercial/maritime context; Canal as pre-Yuan asset).

**Structure suggestion:** GEO–MEM per CIV–MEM–CORE: PURPOSE & SCOPE (corridor, control of movement, bulk logistics); GEO STRUCTURED DATA (region, terrain, chokepoints); strategic logic (land vs water; conquest-as-connectivity); SOURCE EVIDENCE (Weatherford verbatim, Marco Polo if applicable); MEM CONNECTIONS. Mearsheimer ~2/3, ARC ~1/3.

**Index:** Register in CIV–INDEX–CHINA § VIII after MEM–CHINA–SILK–ROAD (corridor pair: Silk Road overland/maritime, Grand Canal riverine).

SUMMARY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
| Proposed MEM | Class | Scholar link | Primary gap closed |
|--------------|-------|--------------|--------------------|
| MEM–CHINA–WAR–OPIUM | WAR | SYNTHESIS 0005; DOCTRINE v0.1; SDI 0001/0002; "century of humiliation" opener | No MEM for Opium Wars; structural start of humiliation arc |
| MEM–CHINA–REVOLUTION–1911 | WAR/rupture | SYNTHESIS 0006; DOCTRINE v0.2; SDI 0001/0002; rupture event | No MEM for 1911; explicit Qing→ROC rupture |
| MEM–CHINA–GEO–GRAND–CANAL | GEO | DOCTRINE v0.3; SYNTHESIS 0002, 0010; conquest-as-connectivity | No GEO–MEM for Grand Canal; corridor/chokepoint for Song–Yuan, Pax |

**Creation order suggestion:** (1) Opium Wars (fills humiliation arc); (2) Grand Canal (fills conquest-as-connectivity GEO); (3) Revolution 1911 (fills rupture event). Alternatively: Opium, 1911, Grand Canal to complete the humiliation–rupture–reconstitution chain first.

**After creation:** Update CIV–INDEX–CHINA § VII and § VIII; add new MEMs to CIV–SCHOLAR–CHINA § XV (Source MEMs available) if not already covered by index; run LEARN ingestion for new MEMs (Phase 1 style) to add entries to § XVI.
