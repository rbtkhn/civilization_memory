**Date:** 2026-02-13  
**Source:** Exercise 3, PREP–STATE–CHINA–EXERCISES; MEM–CHINA–WAR–SONG–YUAN, MEM–CHINA–GRAND–CANAL, MEM–CHINA–DYNASTY–QING, MEM–CHINA–WAR–BOXER–REBELLION (read in full)  
**Purpose:** Two Decision-Relevant History paragraphs using only details extracted from two MEMs each; no MEM names as decoration; no general knowledge.

## I. DECISION SPACE 1 — MARITIME / CORRIDOR CONTROL AND NODE DEPENDENCE

**MEMs read:** MEM–CHINA–WAR–SONG–YUAN, MEM–CHINA–GRAND–CANAL  

**Extracted details (for audit):**  
Song–Yuan: Southern Song held Yangtze valley, coast, commercial surplus; overland invasion had to cross rivers and face Song naval and fortified positions. Kublai promoted naval and riverine construction (junks, ports, Grand Canal for military supply). Land for speed, water for bulk; Mongols expanded and lengthened the Grand Canal connecting Yellow and Yangtze to transport grain and materiel into northern districts. Siege of Xiangyang 1268–1273: decisive node; joint naval–ground operation broke Song resistance along the Han and Yangtze. After Xiangyang, Yuan forces could project downriver and along the coast; Song collapse followed. Control the rivers and the coast, and the southern polity cannot hold. When Xiangyang fell, Song resistance downstream lost its linchpin.  
Grand Canal: Canal links Yellow to Yangtze, extensions to Huai and Dadu/Beijing. Bulk transport of grain south-to-north for capital supply. Chokepoint logic: control of key nodes (locks, junctions) = control of flow. Yuan extension under Kublai for military supply and conquest. Kublai’s extension and use of the Canal was the condition for sustained siege and projection against the Southern Song. Control the canal, control the surplus. Conquest created the incentive to secure and extend the corridor; the corridor then outlasted the conquest.

**Decision-Relevant History (one paragraph):**

When a southern polity held the Yangtze valley and the coast, overland invasion alone could not finish it—rivers and naval and fortified positions had to be crossed and faced. The side that could also fight on water gained the advantage: bulk logistics and siege could be sustained only when grain and materiel moved along the corridor linking the Yellow and Yangtze, with control of locks and junctions giving control of flow. Between 1268 and 1273 the siege of Xiangyang became the decisive node; a joint naval–ground operation broke resistance along the Han and Yangtze. After Xiangyang fell, forces could project downriver and along the coast, and the southern polity collapsed within years. The corridor extended and used for conquest then outlasted the war as the infrastructure for capital supply and trade. For any decision space involving maritime or riverine control—strait, canal, or coastal corridor—who holds the key nodes can strangle the capital or the campaign; loss of the decisive node removes the linchpin for downstream resistance.

## II. DECISION SPACE 2 — INTERNAL STABILITY UNDER EXTERNAL PRESSURE / MANDATE UNDER STRESS

**MEMs read:** MEM–CHINA–DYNASTY–QING, MEM–CHINA–WAR–BOXER–REBELLION  

**Extracted details (for audit):**  
Qing: Final imperial synthesis; peak territorial expansion and administrative consolidation, then systemic exhaustion. External pressures and internal rigidity converged irreversibly. Non-Han elite with Sinicized administration; dual administration (满汉并用), banner system, civil service examinations retained. Agrarian growth and population expansion; fiscal strain as population outpaced state capacity; late Qing fiscal weakness limited reform options. Military failure to modernize proved decisive. External: Western encroachment, Opium Wars, unequal treaties; internal: rebellions. Qing collapsed under combined internal rebellion and external pressure; Confucian legitimacy collapsed as organizing principle; administrative habits and territorial boundaries inherited by successor.  
Boxer: 1899–1901; anti-foreign uprising, siege of foreign legations in Beijing, Eight-Nation Alliance intervention, Boxer Protocol September 1901. Three forces: foreign encroachment (concessions, railroads, missionaries, gunboats); Qing court weakness and vacillation—initially tolerating then briefly endorsing the Boxers, then capitulating; coalition incentive to punish and extract. Balance of power favoured the coalition; Qing could not defend the capital or resist the Protocol. Court first suppressed, then endorsed Boxers—legitimacy vacillation that left the dynasty exposed when the Alliance won. Siege of legations roughly 55 days; Alliance relieved Beijing August 1900, occupied capital; court fled to Xi’an. Protocol: indemnity (庚子赔款), execution/punishment of officials, foreign troops stationed in Beijing, prohibition of anti-foreign organizations. The war encoded the humiliation narrative: unable to resist foreign imposition; court had vacillated and lost. Protocol and indemnity became evidence of the century of humiliation; accelerated loss of legitimacy; dynasty could not protect the realm from foreign force; Qing fell 1912.

**Decision-Relevant History (one paragraph):**

Peak imperial reach was achieved through Sinicized administration, dual elite structure, and retained examinations, while fiscal strain grew as population outpaced state capacity and military modernization failed. External encroachment—concessions, railroads, gunboats—converged with internal rebellion and court weakness. The court first tolerated, then endorsed, anti-foreign violence, then capitulated when a coalition relieved the besieged legations, occupied the capital, and imposed an indemnity, punishments, and permanent foreign military presence there. The sovereign fled; the Protocol fixed the “century of humiliation” in strategic memory and accelerated the loss of legitimacy. The dynasty could not protect the realm from foreign force and fell within a decade. For any decision space involving mandate stability under external pressure: vacillation between endorsement and capitulation exposes the regime; fiscal and military capacity that lag behind population and external threat produce irreversible convergence; defeat that is encoded in narrative outlasts the immediate settlement.

## III. SUCCESS CRITERION CHECK

- [x] **Two decision spaces** — (1) Maritime/corridor control and node dependence; (2) Internal stability under external pressure / mandate under stress.  
- [x] **Two MEMs per paragraph** — Paragraph 1: WAR–SONG–YUAN, GRAND–CANAL; Paragraph 2: DYNASTY–QING, WAR–BOXER–REBELLION.  
- [x] **Details from reading** — Dates (1268–1273, 1279, 1899–1901, August 1900, Protocol September 1901, 1912), actors (Kublai, Southern Song, Yuan, Qing court, Boxers, Eight-Nation Alliance), mechanisms (naval–riverine buildup, Canal extension, chokepoint control, Xiangyang as decisive node; court vacillation, siege, indemnity, foreign garrisons), sequences and outcomes.  
- [x] **No MEM names in the paragraphs** — Reader learns what happened and why it matters without seeing file names.  
- [x] **No general knowledge** — All content traceable to the four MEMs.  
- [x] **Analytically useful** — Mechanism + sequence + outcome; “why it matters for the decision space” stated at the end of each paragraph.

## IV. USE IN CIV–STATE–CHINA

These two paragraphs are candidates for **Section VII (Decision-Relevant History)**. When the STATE file is created, each can be entered as a pattern with:
- **Label** (e.g. “Corridor and decisive node — Song–Yuan / Grand Canal” and “Mandate under pressure — late Qing / Boxer”).
- **Summary** (the paragraph text).
- **Precedent/MEM reference** (for traceability: WAR–SONG–YUAN, GRAND–CANAL; DYNASTY–QING, WAR–BOXER–REBELLION).
- **Activation level** (ACTIVE).
- **Relevance** (when the pattern applies: e.g. “When decision involves maritime or riverine control, strait, or corridor”; “When decision involves mandate stability under external pressure or coalition retaliation”).
