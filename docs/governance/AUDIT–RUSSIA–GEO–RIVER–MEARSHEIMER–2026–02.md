## 2. Mearsheimer Cognition Criteria (Reference)

- **Power distribution** as primary variable  
- **Incentive structure** explicit: what does the balance of power (or river geography) tell actors to do?  
- **Force-ratio / defensive advantage** where applicable (e.g. Oka as threshold, Neva as chokepoint)  
- **RLL linkage** explicit in body or Strategic Insights: 0018 (hierarchy), 0019 (Oka threshold), 0021 (Moscow chain), 0024 (chokepoint permanence), 0029 (Volga–Ob duality)  
- **Direct thesis** ("The fact is that..."); structural logic  
- **GEO–MEM blend:** ~2/3 strategic analysis, ~1/3 ARC

## 3. File-by-File Evaluation (Summary)

### 3.1 VOLGA–RIVER

**Strategic insight:** High. Interior integration, fiscal extraction, Caspian connection, canal extensions, industrial concentration. Power distribution clear. "The fact is that" present. RLL binding section at end (0018, 0021).

**Gaps:** No **incentive structure** sentence in body or Strategic Insights (e.g. "Russia is incentivized to control Volga for interior autarky; adversaries cannot interdict; adjacent states must confront continentally"). No **force-ratio** (e.g. interior vs external—interior commerce beyond naval reach). **RLL–0018, 0021, 0024** not cited inline in Strategic Insights.

**Recommendations:** Add one paragraph after Power Distribution: incentive structure (Russia to control Volga for integration and autarky; others cannot interdict; attack requires continental invasion). Add to Strategic Insights: "RLL–0018 (interior artery), RLL–0021 (chain hub), RLL–0024 (no bypass). Incentive structure: Russia to hold; others to confront on land if at all."

---

### 3.2 DNEIPER–RIVER

**Strategic insight:** High. Exposure corridor, trade–invasion coupling, Black Sea connection, steppe exposure, current contestation, Kiev position. Power distribution for Russia/Ukraine/NATO.

**Gaps:** No explicit **incentive structure** (Russia to hold eastern bank and lower Dnieper for Black Sea access; Ukraine to hold western bank and deny Russian monopoly; NATO to support Ukrainian control). No **force-ratio** (e.g. river as defensive line—crossing cost). **RLL–0018** (exposure corridor) in binding section but not in Strategic Insights.

**Recommendations:** Add incentive structure after Power Distribution. Add to Strategic Insights: "RLL–0018 (exposure corridor). Incentive structure: Russia to secure lower Dnieper and Black Sea access; Ukraine to hold western bank and river line; control of river determines regional power."

---

### 3.3 DON–RIVER

**Strategic insight:** High. Steppe–interior corridor, exposure dynamics, Volga–Don connection, Azov dependency. Power distribution present.

**Gaps:** No **incentive structure** (Russia to hold Don for southern projection and Volga–Don canal utility; loss of Azov negates Don value). **RLL–0018** in binding; not in Strategic Insights. Don is exposure corridor; link to RLL–0032 (outlet) via Azov/Kerch.

**Recommendations:** Add incentive structure sentence. Add to Strategic Insights: "RLL–0018 (exposure corridor). Incentive structure: Russia to hold Don and Azov for southern projection; Don value contingent on Azov/Kerch control (RLL–0032)."

---

### 3.4 NEVA–RIVER

**Strategic insight:** High. Singular chokepoint, Ladoga–Baltic only outlet, St Petersburg dependency, flanking vulnerability. Power distribution and structural reality clear.

**Gaps:** No **incentive structure** (Russia to defend chokepoint continuously; NATO to monitor and pressure). No **force-posture** (A2/AD at head vs NATO flanking). **RLL–0018, 0021, 0024** in binding section but not in Strategic Insights list.

**Recommendations:** Add incentive structure and force-posture after Power Distribution. Add to Strategic Insights: "RLL–0018 (chokepoint), RLL–0021 (conditional Baltic link), RLL–0024 (no bypass). Incentive structure: Russia to hold Neva for Baltic access; NATO to surveil and pressure corridor."

---

### 3.5 OKA–RIVER

**Strategic insight:** High. Threshold river, forest–steppe transition, defensive frontier, Moscow connection, Zasechnaya cherta. Power distribution for Moscow vs steppe powers. RLL–0019 explicitly about Oka.

**Gaps:** No **incentive structure** (Russia to hold Oka as defensive anchor and Volga link; steppe powers to cross Oka to threaten Moscow; crossing = vulnerability). **RLL–0018, 0019, 0021** in binding but not in Strategic Insights bullets.

**Recommendations:** Add incentive structure sentence. Add to Strategic Insights: "RLL–0018 (threshold), RLL–0019 (Oka as Russia's southern threshold), RLL–0021 (second link in chain). Incentive structure: Russia to hold Oka for defense and integration; attackers must cross at cost."

---

### 3.6 MOSKVA–RIVER

**Strategic insight:** High. Capital lifeline, first link in chain, waterway chain position, defensive function supplementary. RLL–0021 is Moscow chain.

**Gaps:** No **incentive structure** (Russia to protect Moskva–Oka–Volga chain; Moscow depends on first link; disruption at any link severs capital). **RLL–0021** not cited in Strategic Insights.

**Recommendations:** Add incentive structure. Add to Strategic Insights: "RLL–0021 (first link: Moskva → Oka → Volga). Incentive structure: Russia to maintain chain integrity; attack on Moskva = attack on capital viability."

---

### 3.7 DVINA–RIVER

**Strategic insight:** High. Arctic drainage, White Sea outlet, marginal/contingency route, seasonal constraint. "Backup route when Baltic closed" logic.

**Gaps:** No **incentive structure** (Russia to use Dvina when Baltic blocked; when Baltic open, Dvina secondary; RLL–0032 bypass logic). No **RLL** cited in Strategic Insights (0018 marginal outlet; 0032 bypass).

**Recommendations:** Add incentive structure and RLL pointer. Add to Strategic Insights: "RLL–0018 (marginal outlet), RLL–0032 (bypass when primary outlet blocked). Incentive structure: Russia to retain Dvina as contingency; value fluctuates with Baltic access."

---

### 3.8 AMUR–RIVER

**Strategic insight:** High. Boundary river, Sino-Russian border, Pacific access, terminal frontier. Shared management logic.

**Gaps:** No **incentive structure** (Russia and China incentivized to manage boundary; neither dominates alone; cooperation or conflict at crossing points). No **force-ratio** or RLL (Amur is boundary, not interior/threshold/chokepoint in 0018/0019/0021 sense).

**Recommendations:** Add incentive structure after Power Distribution. Add to Strategic Insights: "Incentive structure: both sides to manage boundary and control crossing points; Amur defines terminal limit of Russian continental expansion."

---

### 3.9 OB–RIVER

**Strategic insight:** High. Depth spine (RLL–0029), movement corridor, contrast with Volga. **Ob already has explicit RLL–0029 and incentive structure** in § IV and Strategic Insights ("Russia's incentive: hold both spines—Volga for core, Ob for depth"). Strongest of the set for RLL and incentive.

**Gaps:** Minor. Strategic Insights could add one line: "RLL–0029. Incentive structure already in body." Or leave as is.

**Recommendations:** Optional: add "RLL–0029" explicitly in Strategic Insights bullet list if not already. Otherwise no change.

---

### 3.10 VISTULA–RIVER

**Strategic insight:** High. Forward position, projection objective, buffer zone, Central European prize. Not part of Moscow chain.

**Gaps:** No **incentive structure** (Russia to hold Vistula for maximum western reach when possible; Poland/West to deny Russian control; withdrawal = retreat). No RLL (Vistula is forward position, not in 0018 hierarchy as Russian interior/threshold/chokepoint).

**Recommendations:** Add incentive structure. Add to Strategic Insights: "Incentive structure: Russia to hold Vistula when able for western projection; opposing powers to hold Vistula as barrier to eastern influence."

---

### 3.11 DNEISTER–RIVER

**Strategic insight:** High. Frontier boundary, demarcation line, Transnistria residual. Boundary river logic.

**Gaps:** No **incentive structure** (Russia/Transnistria to hold eastern bank as limit of control; Moldova/Ukraine to hold western bank; river defines sphere edge). No RLL (boundary river, not in Moscow chain or 0018 typology as primary).

**Recommendations:** Add incentive structure. Add to Strategic Insights: "Incentive structure: holders of eastern bank to preserve frontier buffer; western bank holders to limit eastern penetration; Dniester as demarcation."

---

## 4. Cross-Cutting Findings

### 4.1 Consistency

- **All 11 files** are GEO–MEM with MEARSHEIMER declaration. No misclassified river files.
- **"The fact is that"** and power-distribution sections are present across the set.
- **RLL bindings** exist in a trailing "SCHOLAR RLL BINDING" section in several files (Volga, Dnieper, Don, Neva, Oka, Ob) but are **not** consistently repeated in Strategic Insights as inline citations (unlike post-audit ocean MEMs).

### 4.2 Recurring Gaps

1. **Incentive structure** is absent as an explicit sentence in body or Strategic Insights in 10 of 11 files (Ob has it). Adding one sentence per file would align with Mearsheimer cognition and with the ocean-audit fix.
2. **Force-ratio or force-posture** is rarely explicit (Oka: defensive advantage north of river; Neva: flanking vulnerability—could add A2/AD vs NATO; Volga: interior beyond naval reach). Optional for rivers where contestation is current (Dnieper, Neva) or historical (Oka).
3. **RLL in Strategic Insights:** Most river MEMs list RLLs only in the binding section. Adding "RLL–0018 / 0019 / 0021 / 0024 / 0029" as appropriate in the Strategic Insights bullet list would match the ocean-audit P5 approach.

### 4.3 Strengths

- **River typology** (interior, threshold, chokepoint, exposure) is well developed and matches RLL–0018. Volga, Oka, Neva, Moskva, Dnieper, Don are clearly placed.
- **Ob** is the best example: RLL–0029 and incentive structure in body and insights.
- **Power distribution** sections are solid. **ARC** integration (A–D) is present where sampled.

## 5. Recommended Actions (Priority)

| Priority | Action | Files |
|----------|--------|--------|
| P1 | Add explicit **incentive structure** sentence or bullet (after Power Distribution and/or in Strategic Insights) | All 11 (Ob optional—already has) |
| P2 | Add **RLL–0018 / 0019 / 0021 / 0024 / 0029** as appropriate in Strategic Insights bullet list | Volga, Dnieper, Don, Neva, Oka, Moskva, Dvina, Amur, Ob, Vistula, Dniester |
| P3 | Add **force-ratio or force-posture** where contestation is central (optional) | Neva (A2/AD vs flanking), Oka (defensive advantage north of river), Dnieper (river as line) |

---

## 6. Summary

**Strategic insight:** High across all 11 river GEO–MEMs. Interior vs exposure, threshold, chokepoint, and depth-spine logic are well developed and consistent with RLL–0018, 0019, 0021, 0029.

**Sophistication:** Strong terrain geometry, power distribution, and (where present) RLL binding sections. Main gaps are (1) **explicit incentive structure** in body/insights (except Ob), (2) **RLL citations in Strategic Insights** for quick reference, and (3) optional **force-ratio/posture** for contested rivers.

**Recommendations:** Implement P1 (incentive structure) and P2 (RLL in Strategic Insights) for all 11; P3 optional. No new RLLs; pattern reinforces existing GEO river RLLs (0018, 0019, 0021, 0024, 0029).

---

## 7. Implementation Record (February 2026)

All P1–P3 recommendations implemented.

**P1 (Incentive structure):** Added explicit incentive-structure paragraph after Power Distribution "structural reality" in all 11 files: Volga, Dnieper, Don, Neva, Oka, Moskva, Dvina, Amur, Ob, Vistula, Dniester.

**P2 (RLL in Strategic Insights):** Added RLL refs and incentive-structure bullet to Strategic Insights in all 11 files: RLL–0018/0019/0021/0024/0029/0032 as applicable; Amur, Vistula, Dniester received incentive-structure bullet (no RLL in 0018 typology).

**P3 (Force-ratio/posture):** Added force-posture to Neva (A2/AD at head vs NATO flanking), Oka (defensive advantage north of river), Dnieper (river as defensive line; crossing cost favors defender at prepared positions).
