# Proposal: MEM Enhancements with Benjamin Franklin Verbatim

**Date:** February 2026  
**Context:** Franklin's writings (Autobiography, Albany Plan, Constitutional Convention speech) are canonical primary sources for colonial/founding America. Franklin appears in MEM–ANGLIA–FRANKLIN (no verbatim) and is on the Declaration committee in MEM–AMERICA–REVOLUTION–DECLARATION–INDEPENDENCE; he is not yet in CIV–ARC–AMERICA as a citable primary author (only Isaacson's biography is listed).  
**Recommendation:** Add Benjamin Franklin to CIV–ARC–AMERICA under ARC-T-EARLY-MOD (Autobiography, Albany Plan, Convention speech, key letters); then enhance the MEMs below with verbatim SOURCE blocks.

---

## Franklin Sources (Verbatim)

**1. Autobiography** (1771, 1784–88). *The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin*. Ed. Frank Woodworth Pine (New York: Henry Holt, 1916) or equivalent; Project Gutenberg 148, 20203. Covers origins, industry, virtue, Philadelphia, civic projects, Albany, London agency.

**2. Albany Plan of Union** (July 1754). "Reasons and Motives for the Albany Plan of Union"; *Papers of Benjamin Franklin*, vol. 5:399–417; The Founders' Constitution (Chicago), 1:7:2. Key line: *"That an union of the colonies is absolutely necessary for their preservation."* Also: Philadelphia as first meeting place for the proposed Grand Council.

**3. Closing speech at the Constitutional Convention** (17 September 1787). Read by James Wilson (Franklin too weak). Madison's notes; standard text in *Records of the Federal Convention*, Farrand, and at Constitution Center / Teaching American History. Key lines: *"I confess that there are several parts of this constitution which I do not at present approve, but I am not sure I shall never approve them"*; *"the older I grow, the more apt I am to doubt my own judgment, and to pay more respect to the judgment of others"*; *"I consent, Sir, to this Constitution because I expect no better, and because I am not sure, that it is not the best"*; *"The opinions I have had of its errors, I sacrifice to the public good—I have never whispered a syllable of them abroad—Within these walls they were born, and here they shall die."*

**4. Other** (optional): *The Way to Wealth* (1757); *Poor Richard's* proverbs; letters (e.g. to Collinson on electricity; to British correspondents on colonial rights).

## MEMs to Enhance with Franklin Verbatim

### 1. MEM–ANGLIA–FRANKLIN

**File:** `content/civilizations/ANGLIA/MEM–ANGLIA–FRANKLIN.md`  
**Current state:** No Franklin verbatim; all analytical.  
**Why:** The MEM encodes Franklin as "persuasion as infrastructure," credibility, empiricism, diplomacy. His own voice is absent.

**Suggested placement:** Section II (Anglian origins) or Section III (Science as currency). Add one SOURCE from Autobiography on self-fashioning and reputation.

**Suggested verbatim (Autobiography, opening):**

> "Having emerged from the poverty and obscurity in which I was born and bred, to a state of affluence and some degree of reputation in the world, and having gone so far through life with a considerable share of felicity, the conducing means I made use of, which with the blessing of God so well succeeded, my posterity may like to know, as they may find some of them suitable to their own situations, and therefore fit to be imitated."
> — Benjamin Franklin, *Autobiography* (1771), in *The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin*, ed. Frank Woodworth Pine (New York: Henry Holt, 1916) or Project Gutenberg 148 (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD) [ERC-PRIMARY].

**Alternative (vanity and usefulness):**  
> "Most people dislike vanity in others … but I give it fair quarter wherever I meet with it, being persuaded that it is often productive of good to the possessor, and to others that are within his sphere of action."
> — Ibid.

**Note:** If Franklin is added to ARC–AMERICA only, cite as (ARC–AMERICA–T-EARLY-MOD) with cross-ARC note when used in MEM–ANGLIA–FRANKLIN; or add to ARC–ANGLIA for colonial/transatlantic figure.

---

### 2. MEM–AMERICA–COLONIAL–PHILADELPHIA

**File:** `content/civilizations/AMERICA/MEM–AMERICA–COLONIAL–PHILADELPHIA.md`  
**Why:** Franklin is Philadelphia's defining civic figure—*Pennsylvania Gazette*, Library Company, Academy (later University of Pennsylvania), American Philosophical Society. The MEM currently has Paine and Jefferson; adding Franklin grounds "print culture" and "procedural founding" in his own words and in the Albany Plan's choice of Philadelphia.

**Suggested placement:** New short paragraph in Section II (Foundation & tolerance) or after Section III (Continental Congress), before Section IV (Constitutional Convention). Lead-in: Franklin's civic projects and the Albany Plan's naming of Philadelphia as first meeting place.

**Suggested verbatim (Albany Plan, Philadelphia as seat):**  
From Albany Plan / Reasons and Motives: first meeting of the proposed Grand Council *"at the city of Philadelphia in Pensylvania"* — *Papers* 5; Founders' Constitution 1:7:2.

**Or Autobiography (arrival / industry):**  
Franklin's account of arriving in Philadelphia (1723) and building his reputation there could support "port and commercial centre" and "diversity and print culture."

**Version:** Bump to 1.5; Upgrade Type: ADDITIVE · Franklin verbatim primary (Autobiography / Albany Plan).

---

### 3. MEM–AMERICA–LAW–CONSTITUTION

**File:** `content/civilizations/AMERICA/MEM–AMERICA–LAW–CONSTITUTION.md`  
**Why:** Franklin was the elder statesman at the Convention; his closing speech (read by Wilson) models consent despite doubt and sacrifice of private objections to the public good—procedure and restraint.

**Suggested placement:** Section V (Primary text) or Section VI (Amendment process), or Section VII (Civilizational memory function). One SOURCE block with 2–3 sentences of the speech.

**Suggested verbatim:**

> "I confess that there are several parts of this constitution which I do not at present approve, but I am not sure I shall never approve them. … It is therefore that the older I grow, the more apt I am to doubt my own judgment, and to pay more respect to the judgment of others. … Thus I consent, Sir, to this Constitution because I expect no better, and because I am not sure, that it is not the best. The opinions I have had of its errors, I sacrifice to the public good—I have never whispered a syllable of them abroad—Within these walls they were born, and here they shall die."
> — Benjamin Franklin, speech at the Constitutional Convention, 17 Sept. 1787 (read by James Wilson), in *Records of the Federal Convention*, ed. Max Farrand (1911), or Teaching American History / Constitution Center (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD) [ERC-PRIMARY].

**Version:** Bump to 1.3; Upgrade Type: ADDITIVE · Franklin verbatim primary (Convention speech).

---

### 4. MEM–AMERICA–WAR–SEVEN–YEARS

**File:** `content/civilizations/AMERICA/MEM–AMERICA–WAR–SEVEN–YEARS.md`  
**Why:** The Albany Congress (1754) met during the run-up to the French and Indian War; Franklin's Albany Plan proposed colonial union for defense. The MEM already frames the war as prelude to founding and imperial strain; Franklin's "union absolutely necessary for their preservation" and his analysis of colonial disunity fit Section II or III.

**Suggested placement:** Section II (North American theatre) after Keegan SOURCE, or start of Section III (Imperial strain). Lead-in: colonial disunity as encouragement to the French; Franklin's proposal for union.

**Suggested verbatim (Reasons and Motives):**

> "That an union of the colonies is absolutely necessary for their preservation."
> — Benjamin Franklin, "Reasons and Motives for the Albany Plan of Union," July 1754, in *The Papers of Benjamin Franklin*, vol. 5:399–417; The Founders' Constitution, 1:7:2 (ARC-T-EARLY-MOD) [ERC-PRIMARY].

**Version:** Bump to 1.1; Upgrade Type: ADDITIVE · Franklin verbatim primary (Albany Plan). Add Franklin to MEM bibliography if present.

---

### 5. MEM–AMERICA–REVOLUTION–DECLARATION–INDEPENDENCE

**File:** `content/civilizations/AMERICA/MEM–AMERICA–REVOLUTION–DECLARATION–INDEPENDENCE.md`  
**Why:** Franklin was on the drafting committee (Jefferson, Adams, Franklin, Sherman, Livingston). The MEM names him but has no Franklin voice. A single attributed line (e.g. on unanimity or signing) would ground his role.

**Suggested placement:** Section II (Adoption — Congress and Jefferson), after the Jefferson or Paine SOURCE. One sentence of context + one short Franklin quote if a reliable verbatim exists (e.g. "We must all hang together, or assuredly we shall all hang separately" — often attributed to Franklin at the signing; source is anecdotal but widely cited).

**Suggested verbatim (if used):**  
> "We must all hang together, or assuredly we shall all hang separately."  
> — Benjamin Franklin, attributed (at signing of the Declaration, 4 July 1776); anecdotal; in *The Works of Benjamin Franklin*, ed. Jared Sparks (1836–40), and later collections. Use with [ERC-CONTEXTUAL] and note attribution.

**Alternative:** Add only a sentence that Franklin was on the committee and endorsed the document; no quote if attribution is too weak.  
**Version:** Bump to 1.2; Upgrade Type: ADDITIVE · Franklin role/verbatim (committee, signing).

---

### 6. MEM–AMERICA–REVOLUTION–CONTINENTAL–CONGRESS

**File:** `content/civilizations/AMERICA/MEM–AMERICA–REVOLUTION–CONTINENTAL–CONGRESS.md`  
**Why:** Franklin was a delegate; Congress met in Philadelphia (his city). The MEM already has Churchill, Paine, Olive Branch, Burke. Adding Franklin (e.g. on union or on the Congress as a body) would tie the assembly to his civic and diplomatic persona.

**Suggested placement:** Section III (Second Continental Congress) or Section IV (Olive Branch). Option A: short Franklin quote on the need for unity (from Albany or later). Option B: one sentence noting Franklin as delegate and his later mission to France (bridge to WAR–AMERICAN–INDEPENDENCE).

**Suggested verbatim (reuse Albany if theme is union):**  
Same as MEM–AMERICA–WAR–SEVEN–YEARS — "union absolutely necessary for their preservation" — with lead-in that Franklin had argued for colonial union in 1754 and now sat in the Congress that was attempting coordination.

**Version:** Bump to 1.3; Upgrade Type: ADDITIVE · Franklin verbatim primary (Albany / union).

---

### 7. MEM–AMERICA–WAR–AMERICAN–INDEPENDENCE

**File:** `content/civilizations/AMERICA/MEM–AMERICA–WAR–AMERICAN–INDEPENDENCE.md`  
**Why:** Franklin's mission to France (1776–1785) was essential to the French alliance (1778). The MEM already has Jefferson, Paine, Chernow, Keegan, Tocqueville; adding Franklin would ground "alliance as force multiplier" in the diplomat who secured it.

**Suggested placement:** Section IV (French alliance as systemic shift). One SOURCE: Franklin in his own words on the need for French support or on the alliance (from letters or reported speech). Requires locating a short, reliable verbatim (e.g. from *Papers* or diplomatic correspondence).

**Suggested verbatim (to be confirmed from *Papers*):**  
A single sentence from Franklin on the importance of French aid or the treaty; exact quote to be drawn from *The Papers of Benjamin Franklin* (Yale) or *Works* (Sparks/Bigelow).  
**Version:** Bump to 1.6; Upgrade Type: ADDITIVE · Franklin verbatim primary (diplomacy / French alliance).

---

### 8. MEM–AMERICA–WASHINGTON

**File:** `content/civilizations/AMERICA/MEM–AMERICA–WASHINGTON.md`  
**Why:** Washington and Franklin overlapped at the Constitutional Convention; Franklin's closing speech (consent despite doubt) complements Washington's restraint and voluntary surrender of power.

**Suggested placement:** Section IV (Voluntary power surrender) or Section VI (Civilizational export function). One short Franklin Convention quote (e.g. "I consent … because I expect no better, and because I am not sure, that it is not the best") to show another founder's posture of consent and doubt.

**Version:** Bump to 1.5; Upgrade Type: ADDITIVE · Franklin verbatim primary (Convention speech).
