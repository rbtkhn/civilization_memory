# CMC Options Menu Enforcement — CMC 3.2

Options are **required** in **WRITE, LEARN, IMAGINE** (SCHOLAR) and **COUNSEL** modes. Apply after every substantive turn in LEARN/IMAGINE/COUNSEL; in WRITE, apply when options are presented (e.g. after MEM draft or edit).

## Core Design Principle

The 8 options (A–H) are a **capability menu** — they teach users what the system can do. Each slot surfaces a core function:

| Slot | Function | Capability |
|------|----------|------------|
| A | Mercouris | Civilizational/legitimacy analysis |
| B | Mearsheimer | Structural/power analysis |
| C | Barnes | Liability/mechanism analysis |
| D | Multi-mind | Three-perspective synthesis |
| E | Backward | Temporal traversal (earlier era) |
| F | Forward | Temporal traversal (later era) |
| G | Cross-civ | Spatial traversal (other civilization) |
| H | Synthesis | Session closure/consolidation |

**Slots are fixed.** A is always Mercouris. B is always Mearsheimer. No semantic shifts.

## Options Menu Ontology

**Options guide, not predict.** An option does not describe what will happen; it **guides the creation** of the next response. Options are productive; they shape the conversation.

**In LEARN mode, the options menu produces recursive learning**: each option directs the creation of the next response, which again ends with options; closure is deferred until the user chooses H (synthesis) or switches mode.

**Options A/B/C are derived from analytical profile files.** CIV–MIND–MERCOURIS, CIV–MIND–MEARSHEIMER, and CIV–MIND–BARNES are the **authoritative source** for how to phrase options A, B, C. The pipeline: **profile file → option text → response**.

**User may manually interject.** Options are a scaffold, not a cage. The user may type any question or instruction instead of selecting A–H.

## Options Menu Style

**Per option:**
- **10–20 words** — Clear, complete questions/prompts (not telegraphic)
- **Guides creation** — Option directs what the next response will deliver
- **MIND-derived** — A/B/C phrased from MIND profiles
- **Time/space** — Invite navigation: eras, geography, connections

**At least one specific anchor per option.** Each option MUST include at least one concrete **person, place, or event**.

## Standardized Slots (A–H) — FIXED SEMANTICS

### A — Mercouris (Always)

Civilizational/legitimacy frame. Option phrased from CIV–MIND–MERCOURIS.

When selected: Load Mercouris voice; 100–200 words; hedged, legitimacy-focused.

### B — Mearsheimer (Always)

Structural/power frame. Option phrased from CIV–MIND–MEARSHEIMER.

When selected: Load Mearsheimer voice; 100–200 words; direct, power-focused.

### C — Barnes (Always)

Liability/mechanism frame. Option phrased from CIV–MIND–BARNES.

When selected: Load Barnes voice; 100–200 words; constraint hierarchy, folksy register.

### D — Multi-Mind

Three-perspective synthesis. When selected: (1) Mercouris 1–2 sent; (2) Mearsheimer 1–2 sent responding; (3) Barnes 1–2 sent responding; (4) Mercouris 1–2 sent wrap-up.

### E — Traverse Backward

Earlier era in same civilization. Load traversed-to MEM; scaffold from its content; 100–200 words.

### F — Traverse Forward

Later era in same civilization. Load traversed-to MEM; scaffold from its content; 100–200 words.

### G — Cross-Civilization

Related MEM from different civilization. Load traversed-to MEM; scaffold from its content; 100–200 words. Leverage typed connections (PARALLELS) or concept tags where available.

### H — Synthesis

Session closure. Deliver:
1. 6–10 word session recap
2. Synthesis paragraph (<100 words)
3. Three follow-on options: (b) small incremental, (c) bigger change, (a) no change

## Contextual Notes (Stateless Design)

**No semantic shift of slots.** A is always Mercouris, B is always Mearsheimer, regardless of what was said before.

**When context is relevant, add a note.** If Barnes has just spoken and selecting A or B would naturally respond to Barnes, add a contextual note after the options:

```
A — Mercouris: How does legitimacy frame apply to Peter's reforms?
B — Mearsheimer: What structural factors drove Baltic expansion?
C — Barnes: Explore a different liability question
D — Multi-mind synthesis on Petrine modernization
E — Earlier: Ivan IV's coercive apparatus (DEPENDS_ON connection)
F — Later: Catherine's consolidation of Baltic gains
G — Cross-civ: Louis XIV's parallel state-building (PARALLELS)
H — Synthesize what we've established

(Note: Barnes just analyzed liability exposure — A or B will respond to his analysis if selected)
```

The note acknowledges context without changing slot semantics. Each options menu is generated fresh.

## MIND-Influenced Traversal

When generating E/F/G options, **rank available connections by affinity for the active MIND** per PROTOCOL–MIND–NAVIGATION.

| Active MIND | Favored Connections |
|-------------|---------------------|
| Mercouris (default) | PARALLELS, TEMPORAL_BEFORE, TEMPORAL_AFTER |
| Mearsheimer (Option B) | DEPENDS_ON, ENABLES, CONTRADICTS, GEOGRAPHIC |
| Barnes (Option C) | DEPENDS_ON, CONTRADICTS |

**Frame option text using the MIND's analytical vocabulary.**

After each response, MIND reverts to Mercouris default (stateless). User can override via manual invocation ("use Mearsheimer lens for traversal").

See PROTOCOL–MIND–NAVIGATION for full affinity matrices.

## Mandatory Requirements

1. **Exactly 8 options** (A–H) in LEARN mode
2. **Fixed slot assignments** — A=Mercouris, B=Mearsheimer, C=Barnes, D=Multi, E=Back, F=Forward, G=Cross, H=Synth
3. **10–20 words per option** — clear, complete prompts
4. **MIND-derived** — A/B/C from MIND files; when selected, load designated MIND voice
5. **Concrete anchor** — Each option includes person, place, or event
6. **Typed connections** — E/F/G should leverage MEM connections where available
7. **Concept awareness** — G can use shared concept tags to find parallels
8. **MIND affinity** — E/F/G traversal respects active MIND connection preferences

## Self-Check Before Sending

- [ ] Exactly 8 options (A–H)?
- [ ] Slots fixed (A=Mercouris, B=Mearsheimer, C=Barnes)?
- [ ] Each option 10–20 words with concrete anchor?
- [ ] A/B/C derived from MIND profiles?
- [ ] E/F/G reference specific MEMs or connections?
- [ ] H available for synthesis?
- [ ] Contextual note added if prior MIND analysis is relevant?

## Example — Standard Options Menu

```
A — Mercouris: How does Peter's rupture-through-modernization affect Russian legitimacy claims?
B — Mearsheimer: What structural factors and force ratios drove the Baltic campaign?
C — Barnes: Who bears personal liability for the elite destruction Peter enacted?
D — Multi-mind: All three perspectives on Petrine transformation (legitimacy, power, liability)
E — Earlier: Ivan IV's oprichnina and the coercive state foundation (DEPENDS_ON)
F — Later: Catherine's consolidation and expansion of Petrine gains
G — Cross-civ: Louis XIV's parallel coercive state-building in Francia (PARALLELS: coercive_enforcement)
H — Synthesize: "Peter's rupture, Baltic access, elite destruction, Western absorption."
```

## WRITE Mode

- Options menu required after MEM edits
- A/B/C fixed (same as LEARN)
- Include at least one editorial option (enhance, validate)
- Include at least one exploration option (related MEM, connection)

## COUNSEL Mode — Recursive Analysis Options

COUNSEL uses the **same 8-slot recursive structure** as SCHOLAR, adapted for present-oriented decision support and external-facing register.

| Slot | Function | Capability |
|------|----------|------------|
| A | Legitimacy/institutional continuity | Deepen this perspective on current situation |
| B | Power/structural constraint | Deepen this perspective |
| C | Leadership liability/mechanism | Deepen this perspective |
| D | Three-perspective assessment | All three on a specific issue |
| E | Historical precedent | MEM-grounded pattern illuminating the present (check connections of loaded MEMs for graph-based precedent discovery) |
| F | Forward projection | What this suggests for a timeframe/scenario |
| G | Cross-entity | How this affects a related entity |
| H | Assessment closure | Synthesize + propose COUNSEL file updates |

**Key differences from SCHOLAR options:**
- **No MIND profile names** — A/B/C use content-based perspective names
- **No MIND voice invocation** — selecting A does NOT invoke Mercouris linguistic fingerprint
- **Present-oriented** — E illuminates present from history (using both dimension-based and connection-based MEM discovery); F projects forward
- **Decision-relevant** — options refine material options, not historical understanding
- **Professional register throughout**
- **H produces actionable output** — proposed COUNSEL file updates, not learning recap

**Same principles apply:** Fixed slots, stateless, 10-20 words per option, concrete anchor per option.
