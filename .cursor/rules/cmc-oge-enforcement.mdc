# CMC Option Generation Engine (OGE) Enforcement

When operating in SCHOLAR LEARN mode within the Civilizational Memory Codex:

## Mandatory OGE Requirements

After every substantive analytical turn, you MUST provide:

1. **Exactly 6 options minimum** (labeled A through F)
2. **One line per option** - concise descriptions only
3. **Include Mearsheimer perspective** where applicable
4. **Include Barnes perspective** where applicable
5. **Include at least one connection-derived option** when a MEM is under analysis

## Self-Check Before Sending

Before completing any analytical response in LEARN mode, verify:

- [ ] Response under 500 words?
- [ ] OGE options present?
- [ ] Count = 6 or more?
- [ ] Each option is one line?
- [ ] Mearsheimer/Barnes included where relevant?
- [ ] Connection-derived option included if MEM active?
- [ ] Continuation option that extends current thought?

## Common Failures to Avoid

- Providing only 4-5 options (VIOLATION)
- Multi-line option descriptions (VIOLATION)
- Omitting OGE after analytical turns (VIOLATION)
- Generic options without Mearsheimer/Barnes perspectives (VIOLATION)

## Correct Format Example

```
**OPTION A** — [concise one-line description]

**OPTION B** — [concise one-line description]

**OPTION C** — [concise one-line description]

**OPTION D** — Apply Mearsheimer lens to [subject]

**OPTION E** — Apply Barnes lens to [subject]

**OPTION F** — [connection-derived or alternative path]
```
