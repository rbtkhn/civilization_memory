# CMC Option Generation Engine (OGE) Enforcement

OGE is **required** in **WRITE, LEARN, and IMAGINE** modes. Apply OGE rules **after every substantive turn** in LEARN/IMAGINE; in WRITE, apply when OGE is presented (e.g. after MEM draft or edit).

## OGE Ontology (BINDING)

**Options guide, not predict.** An option does not describe what will happen; it **guides the creation** of the next response. When the user selects an option, that choice is a directive—the responder produces output that fulfills it. Options are productive; they shape the conversation. **In LEARN mode, OGE is designed to produce recursive learning**: each option directs the creation of the next response, which again ends with OGE; closure is deferred until the user chooses synthesis/stopping (e.g. H) or switches mode.

**Options A/B/C are derived from the relevant MIND file.** CIV–MIND–MERCOURIS, CIV–MIND–MEARSHEIMER, and CIV–MIND–BARNES are the **authoritative source** for how to phrase options A, B, C. Option text is generated *according to* each MIND profile—its analytical posture, key questions, and lens. The pipeline: **MIND file → option text → response**. The option is the bridge; it must be faithful to the MIND file.

**Alignment.** The same source governs both option phrasing and response content. Options and responses are coherent because they share the MIND file as origin.

**User may manually interject.** Options are a scaffold, not a cage. The user may type any question, instruction, or command instead of selecting A–H. The system MUST accept free-form input and respond to it as a directive. OGE optimizes optionality; it does not restrict it.

## OGE Style — Navigate Through Time and Space

Options should make the user feel like **navigating through time and space**.

**Per option:**
- **6–10 words** — Brief, scannable, minimal cognitive load
- **Guides creation** — Option directs what the next response will deliver; not a generic label
- **MIND-derived** — A/B/C phrased from CIV–MIND–MERCOURIS, CIV–MIND–MEARSHEIMER, CIV–MIND–BARNES
- **Time/space** — Invite movement: eras, geography, corridors, frontiers, causal chains

**Optimize optionality.** Each option = genuine fork. No filler.

**At least one specific anchor per option.** Each option MUST include at least one concrete **person, place, or event** (e.g. Churchill, Caspian, 1945 election, Scythian retreat). Concrete anchors keep the user engaged and guide/restrain the system better than abstract framing alone.

## Standardized Slots (A–H) — 8 options in LEARN mode

**A, B, C** — Mercouris, Mearsheimer, Barnes. Always present. Option text **derived from** the relevant MIND file; guides the next response.

**A/B/C Response Format (BINDING · v1.8):** When A, B, or C selected: (1) **MIND load:** Load CIV–MIND–MERCOURIS (A), CIV–MIND–MEARSHEIMER (B), or CIV–MIND–BARNES (C); response MUST satisfy voice and lens therein. (2) **Response:** 100–200 words; frame per MIND (A: legitimacy, hedged; B: structural, direct; C: liability, Barnes fingerprint). Authority: MIND files. No voice bleed.

**D** — Multi-mind response (BINDING format). Option text: 6–10 words. **Response when D selected:** (1) Mercouris 1–2 sent; (2) Mearsheimer 1–2 sent responding to Mercouris; (3) Barnes 1–2 sent responding to either/both; (4) Mercouris 1–2 sent wrap-up.

**E** — Traverse backward in time. Build response on relevant same-civ MEM file (earlier era). Load traversed-to MEM; scaffold from its content; 100–200 words; historical anchor from MEM.
**F** — Traverse forward in time. Build response on relevant same-civ MEM file (later era). Load traversed-to MEM; scaffold from its content; 100–200 words; historical anchor from MEM.
**G** — Traverse to different civilization. Build response on relevant cross-civ MEM file. Load traversed-to MEM; scaffold from its content; 100–200 words; historical anchor from MEM.

**H** — Synthesis: **6–10 word recap** + synthesis paragraph + follow-on options (b, c, a). Session-specific. Functions as **optional stopping**: user may "cash out" with synthesis at any point.

**H in LEARN mode — SCHOLAR file integration (size/risk · OGE_ARCHITECTURE v1.6):** When the user selects H in LEARN mode, the response MUST:
1. Deliver the 6–10 word session recap
2. Provide a fuller synthesis paragraph (<100 words) encapsulating patterns, tensions, and anchor points from the session
3. Optionally suggest (b) vs (c) based on session
4. Present exactly **three follow-on options** in order **(b), (c), (a)**:
   - **b)** Small incremental — Create structured state (named draft + elevation path); min one named draft + explicit elevation path
   - **c)** Bigger change — Formal SYNTHESIS, RLL proposal, or doctrine candidate (RLL = always c)
   - **a)** No change — Recap only; return to standard OGE

**Execution:** (a) return to OGE. (b) execute, confirm what was created + elevation path, return to OGE, offer "Elevate to (c) now?" (c) execute; doctrine may need WRITE mode; optionally preview before write; return to OGE. **Return path:** All options return to standard 8-option OGE (A–H). **Cross-session:** Pending (b) output MUST be discoverable in subsequent LEARN sessions.

## POST-BARNES Semantic Shift

After **every** Barnes interjection, the **next** OGE keeps the same slots but A and B shift semantically:

- **A** — Mercouris responds to Barnes
- **B** — Mearsheimer responds to Barnes
- **C** — Barnes (or another topic)

Slots stay fixed; phrasing is contextual.

## Mandatory OGE Requirements

1. **Exactly 8 options** (A–H) in LEARN mode; A/B/C = Mercouris, Mearsheimer, Barnes
2. **6–10 words per option** — specific preview of next response
3. **MIND-derived** — A/B/C from MIND files; when A/B/C selected, load designated MIND; response satisfies voice and lens
4. **Concrete anchor** — Each option includes at least one person, place, or event
5. **D** — Multi-mind response (4-part format); **E** — Traverse backward (same-civ MEM); **F** — Traverse forward (same-civ MEM); **G** — Traverse cross-civ (cross-civ MEM)
6. **H** — Synthesis or return; close the loop

## Self-Check Before Sending

- [ ] Each option 6–10 words?
- [ ] A/B/C derived from MIND file? When A/B/C selected: MIND loaded? Response 100–200 words, correct frame/voice?
- [ ] D invites multi-mind? E/F/G invite MEM-based traversal (backward/forward/cross-civ)?
- [ ] Each option anchors at least one person, place, or event?
- [ ] Could each option be someone's best choice for some intent? (plausible best response)
- [ ] User could navigate—feel optionality?
- [ ] When user selected OGE option (a–h): response 100-200 words? (Exception: H in LEARN — 300–400 target. D — multi-mind 4-part, ~6–10 sentences. E/F/G — MEM-scaffolded. Free-form: 200-400 target, 500 max)
- [ ] When A/B/C/D/E/F/G selected (LEARN): historical anchor cited? (person, place, or event; MEM preferred; exceptions: short confirmations, H, user skip, no source)

## Correct Format Example

Each option includes at least one person, place, or event:

```
**OPTION A** — Mercouris: Caspian frontier legitimacy shaped Persian containment.
**OPTION B** — Mearsheimer: force ratios, chokepoints explain Darius's northern limit.
**OPTION C** — Barnes: who defects first when steppe denial meets imperial logistics?
**OPTION D** — Multi-mind on Caspian containment: legitimacy, structure, liability, wrap-up.
**OPTION E** — Traverse backward: Kievan Rus' before Mongol (MEM–RUSSIA–KIEVAN–RUS).
**OPTION F** — Traverse forward: Catherine's Black Sea expansion (MEM–RUSSIA–CATHERINE–GREAT).
**OPTION G** — Traverse cross-civ: Ottoman parallel (MEM–OTTOMAN–EMPIRE or equivalent).
**OPTION H** — [6–10 word session recap, e.g. "Caspian containment, Scythian denial, northern limit."]
(In LEARN: H response includes recap + synthesis paragraph + three options in order b, c, a: small incremental, bigger change, no change.)
```

## WRITE Mode

- OGE required; A/B/C fixed; C (Barnes) satisfies mandatory Barnes option.
- When POST-BARNES, A = Mercouris responds, B = Mearsheimer responds.
