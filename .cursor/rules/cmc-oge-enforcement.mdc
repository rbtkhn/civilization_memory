# CMC Option Generation Engine (OGE) Enforcement

OGE is **required** in **WRITE, LEARN, and IMAGINE** modes. Apply OGE rules **after every substantive turn** in LEARN/IMAGINE; in WRITE, apply when OGE is presented (e.g. after MEM draft or edit).

## Mandatory OGE Requirements (LEARN / IMAGINE)

After every substantive analytical turn in LEARN or IMAGINE, you MUST provide:

1. **Exactly 6 options minimum** (labeled A through F)
2. **One line per option** - concise descriptions only
3. **Include Mearsheimer perspective** where applicable
4. **Include Barnes perspective** where applicable
5. **Include at least one connection-derived option** when a MEM is under analysis

## Self-Check Before Sending

Before completing any analytical response in LEARN mode, verify:

- [ ] Response under 500 words?
- [ ] OGE options present?
- [ ] Count = 6 or more?
- [ ] Each option is one line?
- [ ] Mearsheimer/Barnes included where relevant?
- [ ] Connection-derived option included if MEM active?
- [ ] Continuation option that extends current thought?

## Common Failures to Avoid

- Providing only 4-5 options (VIOLATION)
- Multi-line option descriptions (VIOLATION)
- Omitting OGE after analytical turns (VIOLATION)
- Generic options without Mearsheimer/Barnes perspectives (VIOLATION)

## Correct Format Example

```
**OPTION A** — [concise one-line description]

**OPTION B** — [concise one-line description]

**OPTION C** — [concise one-line description]

**OPTION D** — Apply Mearsheimer lens to [subject]

**OPTION E** — Apply Barnes lens to [subject]

**OPTION F** — [connection-derived or alternative path]
```

## POST-BARNES OGE (ALL MODES)

After **every** Barnes interjection, the **next** OGE MUST include:

- **Mercouris responds to Barnes** (option)
- **Mearsheimer responds to Barnes** (option)

These are **MANDATORY**, not optional. See cmc-tri-frame-protocol.

## WRITE Mode OGE

- OGE required; minimum **1 Barnes option** mandatory.
- When POST-BARNES, include M/M response options as above.
