# CMC Option Generation Engine (OGE) Enforcement

OGE is **required** in **WRITE, LEARN, and IMAGINE** modes. Apply OGE rules **after every substantive turn** in LEARN/IMAGINE; in WRITE, apply when OGE is presented (e.g. after MEM draft or edit).

## OGE Ontology (BINDING)

**Options guide, not predict.** An option does not describe what will happen; it **guides the creation** of the next response. When the user selects an option, that choice is a directive—the responder produces output that fulfills it. Options are productive; they shape the conversation. **In LEARN mode, OGE is designed to produce recursive learning**: each option directs the creation of the next response, which again ends with OGE; closure is deferred until the user chooses synthesis/stopping (e.g. F) or switches mode.

**Options A/B/C are derived from the relevant MIND file.** CIV–MIND–MERCOURIS, CIV–MIND–MEARSHEIMER, and CIV–MIND–BARNES are the **authoritative source** for how to phrase options A, B, C. Option text is generated *according to* each MIND profile—its analytical posture, key questions, and lens. The pipeline: **MIND file → option text → response**. The option is the bridge; it must be faithful to the MIND file.

**Alignment.** The same source governs both option phrasing and response content. Options and responses are coherent because they share the MIND file as origin.

**User may manually interject.** Options are a scaffold, not a cage. The user may type any question, instruction, or command instead of selecting A–F. The system MUST accept free-form input and respond to it as a directive. OGE optimizes optionality; it does not restrict it.

## OGE Style — Navigate Through Time and Space

Options should make the user feel like **navigating through time and space**.

**Per option:**
- **6–10 words** — Brief, scannable, minimal cognitive load
- **Guides creation** — Option directs what the next response will deliver; not a generic label
- **MIND-derived** — A/B/C phrased from CIV–MIND–MERCOURIS, CIV–MIND–MEARSHEIMER, CIV–MIND–BARNES
- **Time/space** — Invite movement: eras, geography, corridors, frontiers, causal chains

**Optimize optionality.** Each option = genuine fork. No filler.

**At least one specific anchor per option.** Each option MUST include at least one concrete **person, place, or event** (e.g. Churchill, Caspian, 1945 election, Scythian retreat). Concrete anchors keep the user engaged and guide/restrain the system better than abstract framing alone.

## Standardized Slots (A–F)

**A, B, C** — Mercouris, Mearsheimer, Barnes. Always present. Option text **derived from** the relevant MIND file; guides the next response.

**D, E** — Connection-derived; trace a path through the MEM graph (time/space movement).

**F** — Synthesis: a **6–10 word summary/recap/encapsulation** of the session up to that point. Session-specific, not generic. Functions as **optional stopping**: the user may "cash out" with a synthesis at any point.

## POST-BARNES Semantic Shift

After **every** Barnes interjection, the **next** OGE keeps the same slots but A and B shift semantically:

- **A** — Mercouris responds to Barnes
- **B** — Mearsheimer responds to Barnes
- **C** — Barnes (or another topic)

Slots stay fixed; phrasing is contextual.

## Mandatory OGE Requirements

1. **Exactly 6 options** (A–F); A/B/C = Mercouris, Mearsheimer, Barnes
2. **6–10 words per option** — specific preview of next response
3. **MIND-derived** — A/B/C from MIND files
4. **Concrete anchor** — Each option includes at least one person, place, or event
5. **D, E** — Time/space navigation (trace connection, move to era or region)
6. **F** — Synthesis or return; close the loop

## Self-Check Before Sending

- [ ] Each option 6–10 words?
- [ ] A/B/C derived from MIND file? Option guides (not predicts) next response?
- [ ] D/E invite movement through time or space?
- [ ] Each option anchors at least one person, place, or event?
- [ ] Could each option be someone's best choice for some intent? (plausible best response)
- [ ] User could navigate—feel optionality?
- [ ] When user selected OGE option (a–f): response 100-200 words? (Free-form: 200-400 target, 500 max)

## Correct Format Example

Each option includes at least one person, place, or event:

```
**OPTION A** — Mercouris: Caspian frontier legitimacy shaped Persian containment.
**OPTION B** — Mearsheimer: force ratios, chokepoints explain Darius's northern limit.
**OPTION C** — Barnes: who defects first when steppe denial meets imperial logistics?
**OPTION D** — Trace nomadic denial from Scythian retreat to Caspian containment logic.
**OPTION E** — Persian Gulf: open sea vs Caspian, projection vs buffer.
**OPTION F** — [6–10 word session recap, e.g. "Caspian containment, Scythian denial, northern limit."]
```

## WRITE Mode

- OGE required; A/B/C fixed; C (Barnes) satisfies mandatory Barnes option.
- When POST-BARNES, A = Mercouris responds, B = Mearsheimer responds.
