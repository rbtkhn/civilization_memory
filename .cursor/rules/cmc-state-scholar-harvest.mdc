# STATE–SCHOLAR Relay Rule

## Exclusive Gate

**Only** the **"relay to scholar"** command family in STATE mode may transfer information from a STATE session into SCHOLAR (learn mode). No other mechanism may write STATE session output into CIV–SCHOLAR–[CIV]. State learns from Scholar; Scholar learns from the past and from relayed STATE output—never from STATE except via relay.

## Trigger

When the user issues in STATE mode:
- "relay to scholar"
- "relay session to scholar"
- "relay this session"
- "relay"
- Legacy aliases (backward compatibility): "harvest", "harvest session",
  "harvest this session", "harvest to scholar"

Use the entity currently in focus. If the user names an entity, relay applies to that entity's Scholar file.

## Relay Procedure

Follow **CIV–STATE–TEMPLATE §XIV-B (Relay Protocol)**:

1. **Identify** the STATE session output to be relayed (decision-point findings, pattern audit results, revealed-preference updates, doctrine-check insights, forward-projection summaries, or other session-derived content).
2. **Propose** specific additions to CIV–SCHOLAR–[CIV] in a form appropriate to that file (ENTRY, synthesis candidate, RLL proposal, or pattern note per Scholar template).
3. **Present** proposed additions to the user; apply only after approval.
4. **Record** in the STATE file (State Log or session activity record) that a relay was performed and what was transferred.

## No Automatic Relay

Relay runs only when the user explicitly requests it. STATE session output never flows into Scholar except via this command.

Reference: CIV–STATE–TEMPLATE §XIV-B; CIV–STATE–TEMPLATE §XII (Directionality).
