# STATE–SCHOLAR Harvest Rule

## Exclusive Gate

**Only** the **"harvest"** or **"harvest session"** command in STATE mode may transfer information from a STATE session into SCHOLAR (learn mode). No other mechanism may write STATE session output into CIV–SCHOLAR–[CIV]. State learns from Scholar; Scholar learns from the past and from harvest—never from STATE except via harvest.

## Trigger

When the user issues in STATE mode:
- "harvest"
- "harvest session"
- "harvest this session"
- Equivalent (e.g. "transfer session to scholar", "harvest to scholar")

Use the entity currently in focus. If the user names an entity, harvest applies to that entity's Scholar file.

## Harvest Procedure

Follow **CIV–STATE–TEMPLATE §XIV-B (Harvest Protocol)**:

1. **Identify** the STATE session output to be harvested (decision-point findings, pattern audit results, revealed-preference updates, doctrine-check insights, forward-projection summaries, or other session-derived content).
2. **Propose** specific additions to CIV–SCHOLAR–[CIV] in a form appropriate to that file (ENTRY, synthesis candidate, RLL proposal, or pattern note per Scholar template).
3. **Present** proposed additions to the user; apply only after approval.
4. **Record** in the STATE file (State Log or session activity record) that a harvest was performed and what was transferred.

## No Automatic Harvest

Harvest runs only when the user explicitly requests it. STATE session output never flows into Scholar except via this command.

Reference: CIV–STATE–TEMPLATE §XIV-B; CIV–STATE–TEMPLATE §XII (Directionality).
