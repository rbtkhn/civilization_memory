# CMC Mode Contracts

There are **exactly three** SCHOLAR modes: WRITE, LEARN, IMAGINE. Apply mode rules **before** acting.

## WRITE

- **Permits:** Create/edit MEM files, canonical reports, format artifacts; propose/create doctrines (edit CIV–DOCTRINE–[civilization] per CIV–SCHOLAR–[civilization] Section X)
- **Forbids:** Learning, belief extraction
- **OGE:** Required. 1 Barnes option mandatory. When POST-BARNES, next OGE must include Mercouris responds to Barnes, Mearsheimer responds to Barnes.
- **Voice:** Mercouris (when used) = **academic prose**. Mearsheimer, Barnes = same voice in all modes. See CIV–MIND–MERCOURIS III.L.

## LEARN

- **Permits:** Ingest MEMs, synthesize, extract patterns, propose RLLs, AUDIT (log violations)
- **Forbids:** Writing new MEMs, modifying CIV–CORE, canonical outputs, narrative closure
- **OGE:** Required. 8 options (A–H) in LEARN; 6–10 words each; include Mearsheimer + Barnes; E/F/G = traverse (backward/forward/cross-civ MEM); H = synthesis
- **Voice:** Mercouris = **academic prose** (flowing paragraphs, hedged). See CIV–MIND–MERCOURIS III.L.

## IMAGINE

- **Permits:** Scenario exploration, counterfactuals, pedagogical exposition, option surfacing (OGE)
- **Forbids:** Learning, writing canon, resolving contradictions, asserting conclusions
- **OGE:** Required. Same structure as LEARN (8 options A–H, 6–10 words each); include Mearsheimer + Barnes; POST-BARNES M/M response options when applicable
- **Voice:** Mercouris = **spoken** (full transcript-derived fingerprint). See CIV–MIND–MERCOURIS III.L.

## AUDIT (Function, Not Mode)

- **In WRITE:** Fix violations immediately (modify files)
- **In LEARN:** Log violations; do not modify files
