# CMC Version Decoupling (CMC 4.0)

Under CMC 4.0 Version Decoupling, **content versions track content changes only**.

## Key Principle

- **Governance version** = CMC 4.0 (single source of truth in VERSION–MANIFEST)
- **Content version** = MEM file version (tracks content changes only)

## When to increment MEM content version

Increment version (e.g. v1.0 → v1.1) when:
- Analytical content changes
- Quotes added or modified
- MEM CONNECTIONS updated
- Structure revised

**DO NOT increment version for:**
- Governance changes (CMC 4.0 → 4.1)
- Header format updates
- Compliance status changes

## New MEM files

Use simplified header format:

```
MEM–[CIV]–[SUBJECT] — v1.0
Civilizational Memory Codex · Memory File

Status: ACTIVE · CANONICAL
Version: 1.0
Civilization: [CIVILIZATION]
Subject: [SUBJECT]
Dates: [DATE RANGE]
Last Updated: [Month Year]
Word Count: ~[N]
```

**Note:** No "Governed by", "Template Version Used", or "Compatibility" lines.
These are legacy headers that remain valid in existing files but are not
required in new files.

## Existing MEM files

Legacy headers (with Governed by, Template Version Used, etc.) remain valid.
No upgrade required. When making content changes, increment content version only.

## Governance files

Governance files (CIV–MEM–CORE, templates, protocols) are governed by CMC 4.0.
They no longer declare individual versions. The CMC Governance Version in
VERSION–MANIFEST is the single binding reference.

## Summary

**Content changes → increment content version**
**Governance changes → logged in CHANGELOG.md, not in individual files**
**Compliance status → tracked in COMPLIANCE–REGISTRY.md**
