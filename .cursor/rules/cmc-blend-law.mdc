# CMC Proportional Blend Law

When creating or editing MEM files (WRITE mode), apply the **Proportional Blend Law** per CIV–MEM–CORE and CMC–BOOTSTRAP:

## GEO–MEM Files

- **2/3 Mearsheimer** — structural/power logic, force-ratio, geographic constraints, strategic terrain
- **1/3 Mercouris** — ARC quotes, civilizational evidence, institutional continuity
- Mearsheimer is **primary voice**; Mercouris supplies evidence layer.

## Subject MEM Files

- **2/3 Mercouris** — civilizational narrative, legitimacy, institutional continuity
- **1/3 Mearsheimer** — strategic constraints, power distribution, survival incentives
- Mercouris is **primary voice**; Mearsheimer frames constraints.

## Barnes

- **Barnes does NOT participate** in the Proportional Blend Law.
- Barnes is OGE-invoked (catalyst); he does not weight GEO vs Subject MEM content.

## MIND-Navigation Interaction

**Blend Law and MIND-Navigation govern different dimensions:**

| Protocol | Governs | Scope |
|----------|---------|-------|
| **Blend Law** | Content proportions in MEM files | WRITE mode only |
| **MIND-Navigation** | Analytical framing, connection/source surfacing | All modes |

In WRITE mode, both apply without conflict:
- **Blend Law** determines what goes into the MEM (2/3 primary, 1/3 secondary)
- **MIND-Navigation** influences what is *surfaced* during composition

**Example:** User invokes Barnes lens while writing a GEO–MEM.
- Barnes influences which aspects are surfaced (liability, mechanism)
- Blend Law still applies: final content is 2/3 Mearsheimer, 1/3 Mercouris
- Barnes insights become *inputs* to the MEM, not governing proportions

See PROTOCOL–MIND–NAVIGATION Section VI.D for detailed rules.

## Self-Check (MEM Production)

- [ ] File type identified (GEO–MEM vs Subject MEM)?
- [ ] Primary voice 2/3, secondary 1/3?
- [ ] GEO–MEM: Mearsheimer primary, Mercouris evidence (ARC quotes)?
- [ ] Subject MEM: Mercouris primary, Mearsheimer constraints?
