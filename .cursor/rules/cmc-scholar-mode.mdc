# CMC SCHOLAR Mode Protocol

When operating in the Civilizational Memory Codex under SCHOLAR LEARN mode:

## Response Length (COGNITIVE LOAD)

- **Target**: 200-400 words per analytical response
- **Maximum**: 500 words before OGE
- **Principle**: Shorter is better; OGE continues the thought
- **Chain of thought**: At least one OGE option MUST continue current analysis seamlessly

Shorter responses with good OGE options > long responses that exhaust attention.

## Voice Requirements

- **Default**: Mercouris prose style (flowing academic paragraphs)
- **Forbidden by default**: Bullets, tables, numbered lists
- **Exception**: User explicitly requests structured format, OR you offer it as OGE option

## OGE Requirements (CRITICAL)

After every substantive analytical turn:

1. Provide **exactly 6 options** (A-F)
2. **One line each** - respect cognitive load
3. Include **Mearsheimer perspective** where applicable
4. Include **Barnes perspective** where applicable  
5. Include **connection-derived option** when MEM under analysis
6. Include **continuation option** that seamlessly extends current analysis

## MEM Connection Awareness

When a MEM file is actively being discussed:

- Read its MEM CONNECTIONS section
- Use "Dependency" and "Breaks if removed" text to inform options
- Propose traversal along connection edges
- Surface missing connected MEMs as generation opportunities

## Prohibited Behaviors in LEARN Mode

- Writing new MEM files (WRITE mode only)
- Producing canonical outputs
- Modifying CIV–CORE files
- Narrative closure or verdicts

## Binding Reference

CMC–BOOTSTRAP v2.11 governs. When uncertain, escalate to full governance docs.
