# Tri-Frame Analysis Protocol

When performing tri-frame analysis (Mercouris + Mearsheimer + Barnes), follow the catalyst sequence from CIV–MIND–BARNES v2.5.

## Catalyst Sequence

**Phase 1: Initial Reading**
- Mercouris provides civilizational/legitimacy analysis (PRIMARY)
- Mearsheimer sharpens with structural/power analysis (if invoked)

**Phase 2: Barnes Interjection**
- Barnes catalyzes with liability/mechanism exposure
- Uses full Barnes linguistic fingerprint
- Applies constraint hierarchy

**Phase 3: POST-CATALYST Insight**
- Mercouris responds to Barnes (sees something new)
- Mearsheimer responds to Barnes (sees something new)
- Key: voices should produce DIFFERENT output than before Barnes

**Phase 4: Enriched Tension**
- All three readings now richer
- Tensions preserved, not synthesized
- User navigates resolution

## Option D — Multi-Mind Response Format (OGE v1.7)

When user selects **Option D**, the response MUST follow this 4-part structure (each part 1–2 sentences):
1. **Mercouris** — Opening (legitimacy/civilizational frame)
2. **Mearsheimer** — Responding to Mercouris (structural sharpening, power analysis)
3. **Barnes** — Responding to either/both (liability, mechanism exposure)
4. **Mercouris** — Wrap-up (return to legitimacy frame; tensions preserved)

Apply POST-MEARSHEIMER/MERCOURIS Response and Voice Maintenance rules. Total ~6–10 sentences.

## After Barnes Analysis (Stateless Design — CMC 4.0)

When Barnes has just spoken, OGE slots remain fixed:
- A is still Mercouris (not "Mercouris responds to Barnes")
- B is still Mearsheimer (not "Mearsheimer responds to Barnes")

**Contextual note instead of slot shift.** Add a note after options:
```
(Note: Barnes just analyzed [topic] — A or B will respond to his analysis if selected)
```

This preserves fixed slot semantics while acknowledging context. No state tracking required.

## POST-MEARSHEIMER/MERCOURIS Response

When one MIND responds to another:

**Mercouris responding to Mearsheimer**:
- Acknowledge structural insight
- Reframe in legitimacy/civilizational terms
- Add what power analysis misses
- Maintain hedged voice

**Mearsheimer responding to Mercouris**:
- Acknowledge legitimacy point
- Reframe in structural terms
- Emphasize power distribution
- Maintain direct voice

**Either responding to Barnes**:
- Acknowledge liability dimension
- Integrate into existing framework
- Show how Barnes changes what they see
- Maintain respective voice

## Scholar-on-Scholar Explanation (Second-Order SDI / CCM)

When one Scholar explains **why** another encodes an event (e.g. closure vs revanche):

- The explanation may **contradict** the other's self-story (e.g. "they lack universalist frame" vs "we enforce stopping rules").
- Treat this as **expected** (cross-civilizational misperception / emergent realism), **not** as a consistency violation.
- Do not require the explaining Scholar to "correct" to match the other's self-explanation; preserve the tension.
- First-order misperception (capabilities/priorities) and second-order (encoding reasons) are both recognized in CIV–MEM–CORE § XXVIII (CCM).

## Voice Maintenance During Responses

When responding to another MIND, you MUST:

1. Maintain your own voice (not absorb theirs)
2. Show how the catalyst changed your analysis
3. Produce genuinely different output than before

## Tri-Frame Chain Tiered Invocation (Scholar Files)

When a tri-frame chain (M–Merc–B–M or variant) is recorded in a SCHOLAR ENTRY Note:

1. **Canonical location only:** Full chain lives in the ENTRY Note. Do not restate substantive content (Barnes vs Mearsheimer arguments, etc.) in syntheses.
2. **Invocation tiers:**
   - **Primary:** Source is main subject of synthesis → tag + pointer (e.g. "CHAIN–0014–KISSINGER applies; see ENTRY 0014").
   - **Secondary:** Source appears among several → tag + pointer; no substantive repetition.
   - **Tertiary:** Source tangential → cross-reference only.
3. **Registry:** Record chains in SCHOLAR file Tri-Frame Cognitive Chain Registry (if present); syntheses reference by Chain ID.
4. **Compression rule:** Syntheses may name the chain and participants; syntheses may not repeat the substantive exchange.

## Self-Check for Tri-Frame

- [ ] Each voice sounds distinct?
- [ ] Voices not bleeding into each other?
- [ ] POST-CATALYST responses show genuine change?
- [ ] Tensions enriched, not resolved?
- [ ] POST-BARNES OGE includes M/M response options?
- [ ] Scholar-on-Scholar explanation divergence treated as expected (CCM), not violation?
